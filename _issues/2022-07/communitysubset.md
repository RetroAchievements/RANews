# RAWare
Point of Contact: {% rauserpic Bryan1150 %}

What is RAWare you ask? It's a community event in which we are going to gather microgame, comics and record submissions made in WarioWare D.I.Y. (Nintendo DS) by our RA Community, then put all of them in a save file and make a Subset out of it!
Everyone can participate! The game itself has a bunch of tutorials in how to make all the stuff, so you just need creativity!

For the exact details please read the [forum topic](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=17289&c=126271#126271).

# Irritating Stick
Point of Contact: {% rauserpic timenoe %}

Irritating Stick features a game mode to easily design up to 4 courses. Each RA user can submit up to 4 courses, each course will have their own achievement! Your RA username will appear in the name of the achievement(s) as, <RA Username>'s Irritation <I-IV> (or your own custom name), and your RA profile picture will be used for the badge(s), with some irritating style of course!

If you would like to contribute to the set, detailed steps are in the [forum topic](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=17293).
