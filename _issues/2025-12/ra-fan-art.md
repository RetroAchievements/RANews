Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

We start of the holiday celebrations with a combination of everyone's favourite Christmas games, Elf: The Movie and Elf Bowling! Not to be confused with Elf Bowling: The Movie, which is completely different, yes sir.

Santa is accepting the children's gift requests again... including Paper Mario! His gift request is a classic one: wish for a 1-Up to make his upcoming adventure a bit more relaxing, because it's waiting just around the corner.

To celebrate last year's Retro Achievemas event, Leozlk provides us with some fanart of Snow Bros.! One of the bros is ready to destroy the fleeing enemy with the power of Brazil.

And here we have some more fanart of the most beloved Christmas game ever, Elf! Just without the bowling this time. But hey, with such a grand award and a mark that it's for gamers only, this will be a pleasant experience even without bowling.

It's a Monopoly chance card! You managed to avoid sickness, so you may advance all the way to GO. For some a very tough card to get given the busy period...

Parasite Eve is also back for this edition with a new box art! This time it may even have some RA influence... can't believe we never noticed the name of the game was actually Paretroachievementsite Eve. Also, Scott!

And finally for today's Christmas art, we have Banjo and Kazooie spending some time playing around in the snow. Or well... Banjo is less playing and instead bombarding Kazooie with snowballs!
