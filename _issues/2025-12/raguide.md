The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is a game that needs no introduction, and if you're here, you've most likely completed the [main set](https://retroachievements.org/game2/3934). This set was developed by the king of challenge sets: [AlexHylian](https://retroachievements.org/user/AlexHylian). While other games in the series have extremely popular and thriving speedrunning scenes, Twilight Princess does not get as much attention as its counterparts. As such, it is likely that many reading this are unfamiliar with the glitches and tricks that this game has to offer--I certainly was--and this makes the set feel pretty intimidating. The goal of this guide will be to provide a general route and resources to help you get one of the rarest Zelda masteries on RA. Good luck!

```
Set consists of 40 achievements worth 1,243 points

Set released on 15 Jul, 2024
```

## General Info
### Introduction

There are 3 types of achievements within this set:

<ol>
	<li> Glitches </li>
	<li> Damageless </li>
	<li> Endurance </li>
</ol>

These can all be collected within 2ish full playthroughs, split into 3 chapters. 


The general route for the playthroughs will be:

<ol>
	<li> Horse skip + early master sword (EMS) through tunicless Morpheel </li>
	<li> Full game deathless with 3 saves for the next run </li>
	<li> Remaining damageless dungeons + glitches. </li>
</ol>

Thanks to the folks at [zeldaspeedruns](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp), the glitches have a lot of documentation and tutorials that are actively updated to help you with setups and execution. 

As for the damageless routes, these are just the routes I used. I feel that they are consistent, but if you have a strategy that is more consistent, feel free to update the guide and add yourself as a contributor in the credits at the bottom! Just please remember, consistency for non-speedrunners is key and what the guide should be focused on.

Note that the achievement tables below do not look great if you are on mobile. There will be a collapsible section before each table that will be easier to scroll through if you are reading on your phone. Unfortunately, Markdown is pretty limited, so you will need to scroll past the tables once you are done with the section.

Let's get started with our first playthrough, up through Morhpeel.


## Abbreviations

Adopted from ZeldaSpeedRuns, that I will use within this guide:
- RS - rollstab(s)
- JA - jump attack(s)
- SA - spin attack(s)
- AS - autospin(s) (jump attack + spin attack)
- GS - great spin(s)
- BA - bomb arrow(s)
- LJA - Long Jump Attack
- EMS - Early Master Sword
- BiT - Back in Time

</details>

We will essentially be following the [all dungeons route](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/route/all-dungeons) to get through these achievements, with a bit of variation.

<!-- <details>
<summary> 📱 Click here for a mobile friendly view </summary>
| {% raachpic 398930, 469633, I Don't Like Horses %} | Go to Faron Woods before meeting with Epona for the first time |

Perform [Ordon Gate Clip](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/msb/ordon-gate-clip) at the very beginning of the game by dropping a rock directly next to the gate, slightly right of center, and side hopping over it to get clipped into the gate. Role towards the center of the gate, facing slightly away from the bridge to get bonked onto the bridge.

<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 413725, 469660, Back In Time %} | Perform the Back In Time glitch at the beginning of the game |

Perform [Back in Time](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/bit/back-in-time-glitch#ordon-bridge) (BiT) on Ordon Bridge by soft resetting the game just as you void out. I recommend using the "Consistent BiT at Ordon Bridge" setup in the link above. Note that buffering with item wheel and map  give different timings, if you accidentally pull up the item wheel you will not get the glitch using the setup above. Just void out and try again.

<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 443138, 500038, Sleep Mode %} | On a low% run, cross the Faron Woods without opening the door |

Save after performing BiT by voiding off the bridge to get your menu back, then pausing and saving. The quit and reload the save--you will reload in Faron Springs. Go to the key gate in the area that will eventually be filled with purple haze and save. Kill the Boblins as close to the gate as possible. With the camera facing the gate, collect the blue rupee to [rupee slide](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/tech/pickup-slide#pickup-slide-through-faron-gate) through the gate. Turn on fastforward/disable frame limit on your emulator and wait until Link is mostly through the gate before closing the rupee collection text and running through the loading zone.

*Note: the linked guide above is to get the optimal angle so that this only takes roughly an hour. The actual clip through the gate is not so precise, as long as the camera is facing roughly towards the gate, Link will **slowly** slide away from the camera through the gate. My clip took 7 hours. If you are using Dolphin you may get an error, simply select "yes" and the emulation should continue.*

<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 398933, 469634, Bokoblin Issue %} | Rescue Talo without having a sword equipped |

[ZSR write-up](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/itemskip/wooden-sword) Restart a new save, and get slingshot. Perform Ordon Gate Skip again, and call Epona to get into Faron. Proceed as normal to get to Talo, let the Boblins break open the cage by standing next to it as they attack. Once it is open, kill them with the slingshot.

<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 398934, 469635, Forest of Skips %} | Obtain the Master Sword before getting any Fused Shadows |

Continue through the game as normal after saving Talo until you get to the North Faron messenger fight. Use the setup [here](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/msb/early-master-sword) to do a super jump out of bounds. Make sure to dash off the edge to make it into the Sacred Grove. Also play the wolf song just in case before entering just in case. :)

Proceed as normal through sacred grove to collect the master sword.

Go back to Faron Woods and complete the collection of the tears, then go to the Forest Temple.

> **WARNING**
> Save immediately once you enter before doing *anything* within the temple. This will allow you to retry damageless.


<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 398926, 469631, Monkey Expecialist %} | Defeat Ook without letting him return to the pillar once |

As long as you have the master sword,  you should be able to knock Ook off the pillar, then AS and immediately kill him in one cycle.

<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 398936, 469636, I Learned to Fly %} | Get to the boss room in the Forest Temple without rescuing all the monkeys |

[Skip half the Forest Temple](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/forest-temple#skip-half-of-the-forest-temple-gcn-only) Use a [LJA](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/tech/long-jump-attack) to jump over to where the monkeys are, and normal jump attacks to hop up to the platform shown in the video in the link. Use 1 more LJA to make it to the boss door.

Practice this a few times before doing Forest Temple No Damage, as this will probably be your biggest point of failure if this is your first time learning.

<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 398927, 469632, Forest Temple No Damage %} | Complete the Forest Temple without taking damage |

Unless you got it while doing your glitches to the boss room, restart the dungeon.

- Take your time going through each room so that you are not caught off guard.
 - Save the first 4 monkeys as normal.
 - Skip Ook's cutscene to avoid Deku Babas on the floor at the beginning of the fight.
 - Use the trick from the previous achievement to skip the rest of the dungeon.
 - Stand at the back of the room to avoid all damage from the boss, only stepping forward as required to progress the fight.

 Congrats on your first damageless achievement in the set!

<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 443044, 499990, A New Way of Whistling %} | Call Epona using the Gale Boomerang |

Stand next to Epona weeds and throw the Gale Boomerang at a far away target. Move around to cancel targeting the boomerang, and press A to grab a weed just before the boomerang returns.

<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 411047, 469637, The Postman Stopped to Sleep %} | Go to the second Twilight Realm without obtaining the post office notice |

Save once you enter Hyrule Field. Get your gale boomerang to clip into the wall to [LJA just before the postman trigger](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/world/faron-province#postman-skip-going-to-eldin). Reload your save to try again.


<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 443043, 499989, I'm Not Afraid of the Abyss Because I Know How to Fly %} | Open the chest with the Piece of Heart at the Eldin Province (Hyrule Field) before obtain the Double Clawshot |

There are several ways to get this:

A [gorge hop with wolf link](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/world/eldin-province#gorge-hop-for-heart-piece)

A [LJA while getting both heart pieces](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/world/eldin-province#double-hp-lja)

A LJA to the closer platform with the lower heart piece. I could not find any videos of this, but this is the easiest one to get, it will just take some trial and error to get the distance correct. You will want to jump almost parallel to the gap so you do not bounce off the rock.

<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 411238, 469642, I Can Not Swim %} | Go to Lakebed Temple without having the Zora armor |

I finished Eldin Twilight before doing this, I do not know if it is necessary. 

[Clip through Lanayru Gate as Wolf](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/msb/early-lanayru-province#lanayru-gate-clip-as-wolf), drop into the lake from the bridge and save.

Perform [Pillar Clip](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/msb/early-lakebed) to enter Lakebed Dungeon.

This is without a doubt the hardest trick in this set. You will probably get it on an attempt that you're 100% sure is doomed. Use the setup method in the link above, and keep trying until you get it. 

Make sure you start sinking when the oxygen meter is not visible.
- You need to tap A to swim into the pillar
- toggle Midna just when you get pushed the second time 
- If you are too far into the center of the pillar you will not get pushed 
- If you are too far outside, you will not clip. 
- If you clip, tap swim into the loading zone without hesitating, you will make it in an attempt you thought you would drown on so ***do not reset before you drown!***


<br><hr>

| {% raachpic 411237, 469641, Wolves That Wear Clothes %} | Obtain the Zora armor using Wolf Link |

For this once, continue through the game as normal, after completing Lanayru twilight, head into castle town and start the escort mission. Since you do not have arrows, do [King Bulblin 2 Skip](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/king-bulblin#kb2-skip-bombless) to get through the start. Continue to the graveyard and change into Wolf Link before going to the grave and collecting your tunic.

The quit and reload the save--you will reload in Faron Springs. Go to the key gate in the area that will eventually be filled with purple haze and save. Kill the Boblins as close to the gate as possible. With the camera facing the gate, collect the blue rupee to [rupee slide](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/tech/pickup-slide#pickup-slide-through-faron-gate) through the gate. Turn on fastforward/disable frame limit on your emulator and wait until Link is mostly through the gate before closing the rupee collection text and running through the loading zone.<br><br>*Note: the linked guide above is to get the optimal angle so that this only takes roughly an hour. The actual clip through the gate is not so precise, as long as the camera is facing roughly towards the gate, Link will **slowly** slide away from the camera through the gate. My clip took 7 hours. If you are using Dolphin you may get an error, simply select "yes" and the emulation should continue.* |

Coming out of the table for this one. This is another brutal one that can be done on this playthrough or the next. It takes a bit more to set up on the EMS playthrough since you cannot buy the bomb bag as normal, but is significantly easier with the Master Sword than the Ordon Sword. 

Here is the rest of the route after collecting Zora Tunic to get there curtesy of [BuenosaurusRex](https://retroachievements.org/user/BuenosaurusRex):

(This route gets the boss key so you can easily redo the fight if you fail; game overs put you right outside the boss room). Use the save file you had after getting Zora armor as wolf. Make sure you have 90 rupees unless you want to do pillar skip into Lakebed again (easier with Zora armor if you prefer).  <br>  <br>1. [Steal Izas bomb bag with map warp](https://retroachievements.org/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeldaspeedruns.com%2Ftp%2Fmsb%2Fsteal-the-lent-bomb-bag)  <br>2. Empty the bomb bag then unequip it and warp to Lake Hylia.  <br>3. Swim to opposite of lakebed entrance and speak to Zora and pay 90 rupees for 15 water bombs then open lakebed temple for easy access later  <br>4. Warp to Zora's Domain and get the bomb bag for freeing the goron under water  <br>5. Save + quit to get rid of the rental bomb bag since now we have a permanent one, then empty bomb bag (I like to throw them into the water)  <br>6. Enter Lakebed temple and open chest in first room for water bombs  <br>7.

Get [clawshot early](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/lakebed-temple#early-clawshot-gcn-only). Make sure you open chest for the key since we are skipping the other one  <br>9. Back in main room proceed to activate the first water wheel as normal using your key. Clawshot to skip stalactite.  <br>10. Head back to main room, clawshot the stairs then enter door below with water flowing.  <br>11. Get through the abyss room as normal then open the door at the top and then reenter to set your spawn point.  <br>12. In the abyss room, clawshot to the chest platform then do a LJA to the closest cog (fairly easy since the floor is all abyss).  <br>13. Once on the cog, locate the entrance you need to enter to get to the room before the boss key. Carefully fall onto the platform (jump slash if you slip on the "roof" part")  <br>14. Get the boss key as normal. Then save+quit. Your file is now ready for attempts.  <br>15. Redo skipping of second rooms stalactites.  <br>16. Get to boss door by clawshotting onto chandelier and then carefully falling onto the platform of the boss door.  <br>17. Do Morpheel attempts. Gameover puts you outside boss room to try again.  <br>  <br>You'll likely have 14 water bombs for the fight if you've been opening every waterbomb chest along the way. If you want the 15th, the Zora outside still sells refills for 90 rupees, or you can LJA to the water bomb chest in the stalactite room (second room in dungeon - method in the same lakebed ZSR link in step 7). If you run low on bombs (< 6ish after many game overs) you probably want to reset. If Morpheel inhales you in phase 2 soon after you got an air refill, then you can press A to swim up a bit then grab onto the eye after equipping boots (guarantees easy grab). 

Now for the fight:

Here is the [ZSR write up](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/morpheel) on the actual fight.

Now that you're set up, the actual fight is pretty tough. You will need to [swim with underwater bombs](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/tech/swim-with-water-bombs) to restore your air. Basically, pull out a waterbomb, and before Link has it over his head, force unequip iron boots by opening the item wheel and equipping a different item over it. While holding a direction, close item wheel and don't hold still. Press A to drop the bomb and restore your air. 


Fight summary: P1 can be 1 cycled with a quick spin or jump slash. If you are here with Ordon Sword, it's 1-cycled with prayer and faith. Sometimes the eye will bounce in just the right way to get hit 3 times with Ordon Sword.


P2, start swimming with a bomb, and stay at about the same water level as the boss. When your air is running low, or it is close enough to grab, press A to refill your air, equip iron boots if they aren't already on, and clawshot to attack. Once your attack is over, force unequip iron boots and sink to pull another bomb out to start swimming with. The second time you will want to [regrab](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/morpheel). This time, do the same thing, but wait until it flails its head down to force unequip iron boots (can be buffered with the item wheel), and immediately regrab to finish the fight.


If you are about half way through your air, start initiating your water bomb so that you won't drown.

Awesome job pulling this off! Now time to reset the game and do the 3-heart single session achievement.

## Chapter 2

| {% raachpic 415450, 469630, Hyrule's Sole Survivor (100) %} | Beat the game in a single session with 3 heart containers having collected all Fused Shadows and Twilight Fragments, and without dying or using the soft reset |

This achievement is pretty straight forward. And if you're doing this subset it should be no real issue for you. The only real tip I have to minimize the possibility of a mistake that can cost you hours of effort is to always have at least 1 fairy in a bottle with you.

You can get your first fairy directly in front of the boss room in Forest Temple. This will be inaccessible after your finish it until you get clawshot though.

The next fairy you can collect is in the big archer room in Goron Mines after you lower the gate (under where the chest that you need clawshot for is). This one is repeatable.

The next fairy is in a box floating in a puddle close to the wolf howling stone in Lake Hylia.

After this, complete the first 10 floors of Cave of Ordeals to unlock fairies in Ordon Spring so that you always have a quick way to refill if you need.

> TIP
> 
> To make your life easier, use your 3 save slots to save in the following locations:
> 
> 1. Directly in front of Goron Mines after the sumo battle with the Goron Elder.
> 2. In the entrance to Lakebed Temple before opening any chests or pulling the lever. You can collect all bomb bags + the upgrade before this if you want.
> 3. In the entrance to Arbiter's Ground before entering the temple, preferably with 20 poes collected and Fairy Tears in your inventory. The quiver upgrade would be nice to have later. [locations if needed](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Twilight_Princess_Poe_Souls)
>  
> This will skip repeating a lot of story elements and twilights that you don't need to do for the rest of the set!
> 

> WARNING
> 
> Under no circumstances should you attempt the following achievements during this run:
>
>[Legend of Paper](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/415449) before getting to Gerudo Valley will crash the game, instead do this glitch to skip the owl statue quest.
>[Lazy Knight](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/412760) and [Either You Come down or I Will Advance the Story Alone](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/413251) will trap you in the area with the items forcing you to reset.

Take your time going through the game to feel out each dungeon before attempting damageless in the next run. Try to follow the damageless routes below for some practice, don't feel bad if you don't get any of them. Realistically, you probably will not, but congrats if you do!


Now that you have that out of the way, load up the first save you made at Goron Mines and let's finish out each dungeon.

- Go through the lava jets room as normal, LJA to skip the last one to avoid lava slugs.
- Grab the key, and make sure to wait for the platforms to spin once each before jumping on them, so that you don't jump on them as they start spinning.
- Run through the next room, wait for the lava jets while jumping on the rocks. Use the clip from the previous achievement to avoid needing to dodge more lava plumes.
- After getting the key, keep a distance from the slugs while going through the magnet sections.
- Kill all the moblins and make sure no keese are on you before stepping on both switches, otherwise they could initiate an attack during the cutscene that hits you after it ends.
- Avoid the tektites and grab the key. Tap swim to get some distance from the tektites (they are slow on water), get a breath of air then push the block. Hit the switch and stay on the edge during the unskippable cutscene of the door opening--the tektites might make it to land.
- Sprint to the magnet wall and proceed through the room as normal.
- Run straight through the room, stopping once at the middle level behind a block, to grab the key, then straight for the door. None of the arrows should hit you as long as you are quickly moving through.
- Get the second key shard, and move onto the miniboss.
- Use 4 combo slices to get him to roll the first time. If he lands close to you, spin attack, otherwise do another 4 combo slash. Repeat once more.
- Get the bow, then kill the lava slug on the ceiling before the beamos. Activate all the beamos, then run back to where the lava slug was. Snipe all the beamos to kill them then get the 3rd key shard.
- Kill the lava slug again (it respawned), and go back through the miniboss room to the archer room.
- Kill all the archers from the door, they will not have activated yet. There is one to the left, and several to the right. One on the right will be behind the magnet you need to activate. There are 2 more after you go up from killing the Beamos.
- Snipe all the moblins again in the next room, stepping out of sight if any raise their bows.
- Stun lock the boss by shooting his forehead every time it activates.

Well done! Now let's load your second save at Lakebed Temple.

This is one of the easier ones. We're doing this now rather than in the EMS run because you have bomb arrows that make the miniboss easy. Make sure you haven't opened the chest or pulled the lever at the beginning of the dungeon for your save. 

- Proceed as normal until the main stair room.
- Make sure to avoid the Tektites in the room, shoot them with your bow from a distance.
- Go through the lower, east door and do [Early clawshot](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/lakebed-temple#early-clawshot-gcn-only).
- Next kill the chus and do [LJA over railing](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/lakebed-temple#lja-over-railing-gcn-only).
- Drop into the water and avoid the biri while dropping a water bomb. Make sure the bomb doesn't hit you.
- BA Deku Toad in the mouth as soon as the fight starts then BA his tongue, do this once more to win. [ZSR](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/deku-toad#glitchless-2cycle-with-bomb-arrows)
- Collect clawshot and head back to the stairs room.
- Kill the tektites so that you don't need to worry about running into them if you fail boss key skip. If you do fail and fall in the water, equip green tunic and immediately leave the water before the bone fish attack.
- Break into the boss room with the glitch from the previous achievement.
- Kill Morpheel as normal. If bomb fish attack, block them with your shield and they will back off. Use the iron boots [regrab technique](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/morpheel#regrab-tips) to minimize the chance of getting eaten in P2.

Good job! Now open your final save to start Arbiter's Grounds.

This is one of the harder dungeons, there are a lot of places to take accidental damage. Keep in mind that wolf Link can walk across quick sand by pressing B to attack to reset your height.

- Save as wolf Link at the beginning of the dungeon with clawshot and lantern equipped.
- Run across the quicksand to the lever.
- Kill the 3 mini-stalfos that come out of the sand and pull the lever.
- Progress to lantern room.
- Go along the left side of the room, a wave of mini-stalfos will come out of both corners on the left side. Take them out as you see fit. BA is a good option, so is SA if you aren't greedy with the timing. Once they are all dead, light the first torch, then spawn the wave of mini-stalfos next to the second torch. Kill them, roll across the quicksand, and light the second torch. Roll back across and go through the door.
- If you are a real gamer, do [Poe Gate Skip](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/arbiters-grounds#-poe-gate-skip-) to skip all the dangerous parts before the boss.
- If you are a normal human being, kill the first poe and go to the bottom west floor.
- Kill the bubble and spin the room. Kill the gibdo with BA before grabbing the key. 
- Clawshot up and kill the rat (it will cause issues if not killed here).
- Go through the door and kill both bubbles at the back of the room before engaging with the poe.
- Return to the main hall, and go back to the middle level west room.
- Dash past the rats as wolf Link and go to the large quicksand room.
- Avoid the spike traps by going left-right-left-right over the platforms.
- Kill the bubble and lift the chandelier.
- Go up the stairs and kill the bubble(s) that followed you.
- Turn the room and kill the gibdo with BA before grabbing the key.
- Slowly make your way through the hall, killing all mini-stalfos with stabs or spin attacks.
- Once they stop walking towards you, kill the first gibdo with BA at a distance.
- Go towards the corner with a charged SA to see if there are any mini-stalfos left over hiding out of view.
- If not/once killed, kill the other gibdo with BA from a distance as well and kill the third poe.
- Go through to ghost rat room, and across to the eastern large sand room.
- Push the block and climb over next to the sand on the other side. 
- Kill both sand snakes before pulling the level to raise the chandelier.
- Go through the the stalfos room.
- Let him stop to attack you before backing up and shooting him with a BA.

> CAUTION
> 
> You will feel really silly if you shoot the Stalfos too close and take damage blowing yourself up (speaking from experience).

- Light the close torch then the far left torch to open the door.
- Kill the last poe. 
- Clawshot to the target and go back to the main hall and through the poe door.
- Kill both bubbles in the room, then [clip to get the boss key](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/arbiters-grounds#boss-key-early-clipping) just like you did for the achievement earlier.
- Go back through the door on the side of the boss key.
- Drop down, and drop down on the far side of the opening on the left side.

> WARNING
> 
> If you drop down on the close side (left side when looking at the opening), you will get trapped in a spot you need the spinner to escape and will need to reset!

- Wolf walk across the sand to the door.
- Wolf walk across the sand in this room avoiding the whirlpool and drop down.
- Wait for the Stalfos to assemble before spawn killing them with BA. They are vulnerable when the target icon appears above their head.
- Roll across the sand to wake the last one, then roll back and shoot it when it is vulnerable.
- Take your time to avoid the spinning spike thing, and proceed as normal to Death Sword.
- Kill Death Sword as normal. 
- Let it attack you before counterattacking, avoid its attack by running in circles around it.
- Grab spinner and return to the large spinner room. 
- You can use [this movement](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/arbiters-grounds#epic-spinner-room-movement) to avoid the spinning spike thing.
- If you do not want to try that, just stand on the small ledge in front of it and wait for it to be safe before hopping on your spinner and passing.
- Be careful dodging the spiked spinners on the last part going up.
- Enter Stallord's chamber.
- In Phase 1, your biggest enemy will be the spiked spinners on the outer ring.
- Turn on your volume to listen for the spiked spinners.
- Every time you return to the outer ring to recharge your momentum, ride parallel to the track before attaching to it. Wait for a spiked spinner to pass, then attach to the track and hop back off to attack.

> CAUTION
> 
> Never just hop straight onto the track!!
> 
> I will repeat it here to emphasize it: Every time you return to the outer ring to recharge your momentum, ride parallel to the track before attaching to it. Wait for a spiked spinner to pass, then attach to the track and hop back off to attack.
> This will be the most dangerous part of the fight, avoiding these spinners is paramount!

- Stay out of the front of Stallord as that's the only place he can attack.
- In [Phase 2](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/stallord#phase-2), do quick knockdown into a 1-cycle to avoid all danger.

Whew. Awesome job! That one was a really rough dungeon. Now onto something significantly easier.

This is significantly easier than the previous dungeon, since you get to skip 90% of it! Save at the entrance with full bombs and arrows, you'll need them later.

- Start by [LJA to the heart piece chest](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/snowpeak-ruins#early-heart-piece-2) just like the previous achievement.
- Aim up at the ceiling with your clawshot and shoot through the ceiling to go to the second floor.
- Use the third method of dropping down in the [video linked](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/snowpeak-ruins#floor-clip). I found it most consistent to drop down to the top of the lower Freezard cage, target the upper Freezard and get close to its cage, the side hop to slide down.
- Push the block and do [ladder skip](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/snowpeak-ruins#ladder-freezard-cancel) and hop down to the courtyard.
- Ladder skip takes a minute to learn, but once you get the timing down it's sureprisingly consistent. Drop the first time between the 7th and 8th rung. If you hear the Freezard creak, climb up to the 19th rung and pause for 1.5 - 2.5ish climbing beats (see linked video above for second drop timing), and drop from a complete standstill to be able to grab again. If the creak is audible again, wait until the end of the attack to climb the rest of the way up.
- In the courtyard, spawn the 2 wolfos and smack them with a charged SA when they jump at you. Kill them then spawn the 3rd wolfos and kill it too. 
- Dig for the key, and open the door to get your cannonball to kill the freezard.
- BA the ice cubes to get rid of them.
- Enter the fight with [Darkhammer](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/darkhammer).
- Clawshot the ceiling behind him and drop to bait an attack
- Mortal draw his tail to kill in 1 hit by standing at a bit of a distance to not hit the armor, or use 2 BA to kill him.
- Grab your Ball and Chain and return to the courtyard.
- Go straight for the door you opened with the key earlier and do [ladder skip](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/snowpeak-ruins#ladder-freezard-cancel) again.
- This time go into the door to the left of the Freezard.
- Do not fully enter the room, stand by the door and BA all the icicles on the ceiling one by one.
- Once they fall, shoot the Chilfoe with another BA to kill it.
- Shoot the pews if they are in your way, otherwise back up to stay out of range of any Chilfoes that you cannot immediately BA.
- Collect the boss key and head for the boss room.
- In phase 1, just keep hitting her with Ball and Chain until she dies.
- When she shoots ice cubes at you, throw your Ball and Chain once to hit any that might be coming towards you.
- In phase 2, just do the vanilla fight. Make sure to stay away from walls so that you can see where the gap is in the circle of ice cubes.

Well done! Let's move on to Temple of Time.

Just when the bomb passes its 3rd quick flash, release jump attack and force unequip your iron boots. If done correctly, Link will grab onto the fence and you can climb behind and open the chest. |

This one can be rough, mostly for the boss fight. If you did the base set of TP recently you're probably ready, otherwise practice getting through the first wave of spiders while dodging the laser. If you haven't gotten the first quiver upgrade or extra bomb bags/upgrades yet, now would be the time, you're going to need a lot. Save at the entrance with a full quiver and bomb bags.

- Go through the dungeon up to the elevator floor, killing everything except the armos statue on the way up. BA all the Lizalfos from stairwells to stay safe.
- Make your way to the stairs, once again using BA to kill all the Lizalfos on the way. Get the one on the stairs too.
- Wait for the spiked spinners to pass before running over hugging the outer fence and grabbing the statue to put on the buttons.
- [Skip the second statue](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/temple-of-time#skip-using-block) by timing a forward roll and holding forward after the cutscene ends.
- Enter the room and kill both armos statues by shooting a BA to explode just behind them and collect your key.
- Return to the elevator room and wait for the spiked spinners to pass before hugging the outer gate and running to the door.
- Hit the switch and [clawshot to the target](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/temple-of-time#crystal-switch-skip). 
- Slowly make your way through the next room killing all Lizalfos with BA. If you get seen by an Dynalfos, just spam Ball and Chain until it's dead. Do not back into the electric gate while trying to get an angle on the second Dynalfos.
- In the next room BA the spiders from the ledge until you feel comfortable running through.

> CAUTION
> 
> The spinner feels tempting to use in this room, but it bounces off the steps. You need to jump to each step individually to not be bounced back into the mass of spiders.

- Get [Early Boss Key](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/temple-of-time#boss-key-early) to save yourself so grief later. I prefer the Backslice method to jump into the rail, then slowly walk up and over to the pillar shown in the video.
- In the boss key room, clawshot both helmasaurs, then BA everything in the room. Use the 2 statues available and 2 helmasaur helmets to open the boss key door.
- Continue to the next room, kill the beamos with a BA and time your way through the spiked spinners.
- Kill all Lizalfos with BA, and collect the key. Carefully make your way to the switch with a pot/statue and go up the stairs. [There are some neat ways to skip this](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/temple-of-time#get-past-electric-barrier-lja) but I didn't have confidence to try them without getting hit.
- BA all the small spiders, then the armos statues and enter Darknut's room.
- Normal Darknut fight, as long as your shield is up when he attacks he can never hit you. 
- Sidestep vertical slashes and do damage in phase 1.
- Sidestep the 3rd part of his combo and do damage in phase 2.
- In phase 2, backslashes also break his guard. Just do not be greedy on this fight and you will be fine.
- Walk the statue back down to the scale room, using its hammer to destroy all hazards along the way.
- [Skip the scales](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/temple-of-time#skip-the-scales) by standing right behind the statue between it and the scales and backhopping across.
- Use the statue to kill all the spiders, and continue down using the statue to destroy gates and beamos.
- In the elevator room, wait for the spinners to pass again and then go to the bottom floor with the statue.
- Kill all the spiders with the statue or BA, whichever feels more comfortable to you.
- Kill the beamos with BA as well as the two Lizalfos close to the bell.
- DO NOT destroy the beamos with the statue or you will be swarmed by spiders.
- Get the statue the rest of the way down and enter the final hall.
- Kill all 3 beamos with BA from the entrance. 
- Hug the wall and grab the statue on the way while avoiding all hazards.
- BA the two spiders at the end just to be safe.
- In Phase 1 just shoot the eye as soon as it opens and hit it with the statue.
- In Phase 2, wait for the cutscene to end, then stand far away and shoot as many BA at the spiders as you can before you need to start running.
- While backwalking, continue targeting and shooting BA to kill the spiders until they're all dead.
- Stop backwalking and avoid the laser as it appears. If you can keep track of Armogohma, do so so that you do not accidentally walk into the laser when the room turns red.
- Do not try to shoot the eye if the laser is already coming out, just wait until the next opportunity.
- In Phase 3 it's the same as Phase 2, except you can BA the eggs as they are falling and take most of them out immediately.
- In Phase 4 just shoot the eye with a BA to finish the fight.

Great job! This dungeon was a bit of a gauntlet, but so long as your aim was true, you should have made it through just fine. I found the next dungeon to be a bit less stressful.

This one has a nice little skip and a couple fun LJAs. Save at the entrance after the cutscene and talk with Ooccoo.

- Open the door with an arrow and avoid the babas to enter.
- LJA or fly across the gaps. Make sure the helmasaurs are dead or already ran past you before clawshotting onto the higher ledger/climbing up the final ledge.
- Turn into wolf roughly a tile away from the door before entering to [avoid turning the fan on](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/city-in-the-sky#fan-trigger-skip-for-early-boss-key).
- Kill the giant armor beast in the room, then head over to the west door to grab your key.
- Go back and through the east door, killing the babas as you make your way to the spinner switch.
- Wait for the helmasaur to run past you before [LJAing to the door](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/city-in-the-sky#fan-room).
- Run through and [LJA to the door once again](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/city-in-the-sky#block-room-ljas). Only do the LJAs you feel comfortable with.
- BA both Dynalfos before they see you and continue as normal to the large room leading to the miniboss.
- Grab an Ooccoo and jump down to the left of the platform you start on.

> WARNING
> 
> Do not land on the rounded pillar things, Link will drop Ooccoo and slide off into the void.

- Steer back towards the large white wall that has the entrance from an earlier room and continue dropping down just left of that avoiding the rounded platform.
- Land on the flat platform then find the boss room corridor below. 
- Wait out the wind (it shouldn't hit you anyway at this height) and jump towards the corridor with Ooccoo.
- Land and enter.
- Initiate the fight and gale boomerang to force Aeralfos to raise it's shield.
- Smack it around until Phase 2.
- In Phase 2, stand near the center of the arena and continuously target towards the 3 openings until Aeralfos appears.
- If you feel like you targeted quick enough, clawshot him down and finish him off. If you feel unsure, block and wait for the next opportunity.
- While double clawshotting back up, make sure to aim high enough on the vines so that you do not fall off and take fall damage.
- Return to the main hall as normally, killing the ceiling babas with arrows when you pass that part.
- Clawshot up to the boss key area just like you did leaving Aeralfos.
- Kill both helmasaurs so that they won't be a pain on the way back down.
- [Clip up to the boss key](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/city-in-the-sky#clip-to-boss-key-kai-clip) and avoid the monsters while grabbing the boss key, then lower yourself back down.
- Start the fan as normal, then lower yourself back down.

> CAUTION
> 
> If you drop from the switch you will take fall damage, lower yourself back down!

- Head out the north door and kill all the flying enemies with arrows.

> WARNING
> 
> If you clawshot onto the grate with the running fan you will take damage and feel dumb. :( 

- Clawshot through the propellors as normal and enter the final room before the boss.
- Immediately boomerang and clawshot the first Aeralfos you see.
- Try to get in 4 quickspin GS allowing yourself 1 shield bash to break the guard when needed. Do not do any more than this.
- If you succeeded it will die, block the incoming attack from the other Aeralfos. Otherwise, shift target to block, then boomerang to pull it out of the sky again to finish it off.
- Kill the second one and make your way to the boss.
- This is one of the easier bosses to do damageless.
- Stay out of the center of the arena during Phase 1 to avoid the passby, then climb partially up one of the side grates to get your second attack in.
- In Phase 2 as long as you keep moving you should avoid all fire.
- Watch out for the fire after your first 2 successful hits, it will finish, then shoot more fire in front of where you were going, so you will need to turn around to avoid it.

Awesome job! Now onto what I found to be the most difficult dungeon in the game. Good luck!

#### Palace of Twilight

| {% raachpic 413439, 469657, Palace of Twilight No Damage %} | Complete the Palace of Twilight without taking damage |

Save at the entrance after you talk to Midna, before entering any doors. I found this one to be pretty difficult, probably because I was rushing so much, but there are just so many enemies to avoid. Regardless, if I did it, you can definitely do it, so good luck!

- Go to the west wing, dodge the babas and kill the Zant head.
- Turn into wolf to kill the next Zant head, do not grab the treasure by the door.
- [Quick kill Phantom Zant](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/phantom-zant#1cycle-with-greatspin) by slashing him once then hitting him with 3 quickspin GS.
- Grab the sol and *carry it* until you see the cutscene of the hand waking up.
- Drop the sol into the slot and charge a SA to kill the squeebs that spawned.
- Go to the next room and get close enough to the haze to spawn the squeebs, kill them with several stabs until they are all dead.
- Throw the sol to the slot from where the stairs will raise.
- Collect the sol and hug the rail on the way to the door to avoid the squeebs that drop down and attack you.
- Run straight through the last room, once you pass the last baba, run in a semi-circle around the squeebs to avoid them and get to the door.
- Move onto the east wing.
- Kill the keese and head towards the other side of the room.
- Stop to raise your shield and avoid any Zant beams that come your way.

>[!CAUTION]
>The Zant head beams may strike you after they have passed your shield, it's best to attempt to avoid them than to block them. This goes for the whole dungeon.
 
 - Use a GS to kill the head when you get close enough.
 - [Use this movement more or less](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/palace-of-twilight#east-room-2). Kill the messengers with a Midna target, then kill the Zant head with 2 targets, then go to the center of the 3 heads and kill them with a Midna target on all 3 of them.
 - [Quick kill Phantom Zant](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/phantom-zant#1cycle-with-greatspin) by slashing him once then hitting him with 3 quickspin GS once again.
 - Carry the sol until the cutscene plays once again.
 - Spawn the squeebs then kill them with a charged SA and kill the messenger with a charged SA as well.
 - Run straight forward the [throw the sol] immediately into the slot. Skip the hand cutscene. The keese should attack you during the cutscene while you are invulnerable.
 - Immediately roll out of the way of any potential incoming attacks and go to the next room.
 - Jump across the platforms and place the sol down on the last platform that carries you to the door. Kill the keese as you pass them.
 - Get light sword and SA to open the waterfall and jump through.
 - Turn into wolf and sprint through the haze. 
 - If a keese followed you, kill it. 
 - Kill the baba with your boomerang and throw the sols into the slots from the ledge.
 - Kill the mass of squeebs with a spin attack and sprint to and up the stairs.
 - Kill the keese by the light orb.
 - Manually aim your boomerang to kill the baba as you move towards the next platform.
 - Kill the 3 Zant heads that spawn in a mass and dodge or block the beam from the last one.
 - Kill the last one, then charge a SA where the baba was to kill the final 2 Zant heads that will spawn there.
 - Collect your key and head to the door.
 - Be wary of all the keese here, it's possible to miss pressing A on the key hole and get hit.
 - Kill the messenger with a slash and turn your volume up.
 - Keep a SA charged and ride the platform to the first Zant head.
 - If you see an enemy approach or hear one start to attack, release your spin attack to kill it.
 - Head back to the main platform to kill all 3 Zant heads.
 - Continue to keep an ear out for the flying enemies' attacks.
 - Kill the next Zant head, and charge a SA around that same spot to kill the last 2.
 - Kill any more flying enemies around you, including the one on the post next to the key chest that just spawned.
 - Spin attack to open the waterfall and jump through.
 - Kill all 3 enemies and climb up to the chest.

> WARNING
> 
> Do not jump all the way back down, you will take fall damage!

- Jump to the side to land on a middle platform before jumping the rest of the way down.
- SA to open the waterfall again and go into the last room.
- When the barrier falls, charge a SA to kill all 4 messengers at once.
- Ride the platform up and jump to the one in front of you, then to the right.
- Jump to the platform with the baba and kill it with a boomerang.

> CAUTION
> 
> This is the last height you can fall from and not take damage. Be careful for the rest of the way up.

- Continue up, stay on the right side of the platform facing the Zant head. If it attacks, walk to the left side to avoid the beam.
- Kill the Zant head and clawshot up to the last platform.
- Wait for it to be under you to avoid accidentally falling to take damage.
- This time stay on the left side and dodge right as you make your way to Zant.
- If you think you will be hit while aiming your clawshot for the target, wait for the next cycle to clawshot over and kill the head.
- Continue to the final room.
- Kill the first messenger, then use a SA to disperse the haze.
- Go to where the haze was and kill the messenger that drops.
- Use charged SA to kill the next 5 waves in 1 hit each.
- Enter Zant.
- Hopefully you're coming from the main set where you will already have had plenty of practice at doing this fight hitless. Remember to take things slow when needed.
- Phase 1, throw a boomerang and AS him when he drops, then throw it again and kill him.
- Phase 2, roll towards him and pop on iron boots. Wait out the jumps and block the incoming beams. Roll towards him and AS him.
- Put on your iron boots again and wait for 4 jump cycles before taking them off and running around the side of the arena to avoid the beams to hit him again.
- Phase 3, put on iron boots and zora tunic and clawshot him out as the head opens, and hit him 4 times.
- Take off your iron boots and wait in the center where the head was. Find the next head to open and swim over to it. Clawshot him out and finish him off.
- Phase 4, go to the outer ring of totem polls and wait for him to start attacking, go in a semi-circle-ish path to roll into the poll and boomerang him to knock him off.
- [You can immediately knock him down](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/zant#phase-4-ook) to finish him off, or wait for him to teleport and roll towards him in the same motion as before to finish the phase.
- Phase 5, stand at a wall with your Ball and Chain ready, facing slightly to the right or left. He cannot hit you with the initial drop. When he drops, hit is foot and AS to hit him. 
- Repeat and move onto phase 6.
- This phase is hecktic if you don't go in with a plan.
- The [speedrun strat with greatspin](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/zant#phase-6-hyrule-castle) felt most consistent to me. AS immediately, then AS again, then instead of dodging like is optimal for time, charge a SA and immediately release it once it's charged to knock Zant away and open him up for the last him using GS or mortal draw.

Wow, you've done it! Feel good, because you're almost done. Onto Hyrule Castle!

Here it is, the end of the main game. Surprisingly the castle itself is not bad. The real challenge comes from the bosses at the end. Good luck! Let's get through this. Save right at the entrance. 

- Go towards the west courtyard. 
- BA the two bokoblins in front of the gate
- Once the barrier appears, use a SA to kill the rest, swiping away any flying foes as needed.
- [Skip the second barrier](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/hyrule-castle#skip-barrier-2) by immediately skipping the cutscene and rolling backwards.
- Kill King Bulblin by slapping him with your sword and continuously using full charged GS on his back until he dies.
- Run around the second barrier that you skipped and go into the Castle.
- [Skip the third barrier if you want](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/hyrule-castle#skip-barrier-3) by doing a JA toward the right pillar and mashing start to skip the cutscene.
- SA to kill the bokoblins so they don't follow you up the stairs and hit you while you aim your clawshot.
- Kill the darknut as normal.
- Go to the west wing and go through the torch puzzle. Be ready for the keese that drop after you light the first torch.
- BA the two Dynalfos guarding the next door.
- Go out and kill the Aeralfos just like in the City in the Sky and collect the key.
- Collect the boss key and go into the upper castle.
- Turn into wolf Link and kill the ghost rats with a quick spin, and follow the ghosts through the room.
- Go up the stairs killing the Lizalfos with BA when you reach the platforms.
-  [Skip the last darknut](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/dungeon/hyrule-castle#skip-final-darknut-fight) just like in the achievement above.
- For Puppet Zelda, watch her attacks closely. 
- If she charges a ball, stand under her and charge a SA to immediately hit it back when she throws it. There is plenty of time to react to her, she throws it later than it feels like she should.
- If she lunges you can block or sidestep.
- If she makes a triforce, sidehop out of the way as fast as you can.
- After the first ball, she will do at least 1 other attack until the next one. After the second ball, there will be at least 3 other attacks until the final one.
- For Beast Ganon, if you still have for tears, use them here for a [2-cycle](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/boss/ganondorf#dark-beast-ganon).
- Make sure you shoot him from far enough away to give you time to sidehop out of him sliding towards you.
- For Dark Rider Ganon, start the fight by going left, then dashing twice. This should avoid the attacks and get you behind him.
- Target and aim Epona to face him while charging a SA. When Zelda shoots him, dash forward and release B. Repeat 2 more times.
- For Dark King Ganon, do exactly what you did for the 100 knock downs achievement. It should have made you very comfortable with the AS required to knock him down for this phase.
- As a refresher, slap him with your sword and walk behind him while he's blocking, then AS as he kicks the air in front of him 3 times to knock him down and kill him.

It's over! The dark king is dead! Take a deep breath, because now you're onto the final gauntlet.

The final damageless challenge, and certainly the one that takes the longest. There's a good chance you get it while working on The Fairy Hero achievement. Again, I highly recommend getting [infinite bombs and arrows](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tp/misc/iza-1-skip-and-infinite-bomb-arrows#backup-to-kargarok-oob-clip) for this. Here's a [video of me completing it for a second time](https://youtu.be/Bfa2Mx_JxIk) while finishing off that achievement, and here was my general strategy for each floor. I copied and pasted the enemy list from [Zelda Dungeon](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/twilight-princess-walkthrough/cave-of-ordeals/).

A few things to keep in mind while doing this is that keese, rats, bubbles, and chus should not be underestimated, I was hit from behind by them several times. Kill as many from the ledge as you can before dropping down. I recommend not even getting close to any chus, just BA them from the ceiling before you jump down and from the ground after you jump down. 

Bubbles can float up to the ledge you are shooting from. If you see one rising up, stop shooting because there is a chance it pops up suddenly and makes you blow yourself up.

Bulblin archers are very dangerous, but they always go check on bombs, stand in the middle of the ledge and throw loose bombs by holding target and mashing the bomb button (do not press A to throw, or you may accidentally roll if there are 3 bombs loaded at once). Continue throwing until the door opens--your controller will rumble.

Freezards can be killed by baiting an attack, waiting for it to end, then closing the distance and hitting them twice with Ball and Chain. Do not underestimate the ice cubes they drop out--back up and BA them or Ball and Chain them if you have a decent distance.

Darknuts can all be fought 1 on 1, you just need to be patient. If you accidentally activate more than one, kite them around the arena only targeting one. Step forward to bait an attack and hit it 1-2 times until the armor comes off, then quickspin GS to break guard and quickspin GS once more to get a hit in. As long as you do not get greedy, you can get damageless with all 4 darknuts activated at once.

Since this strategy revolves around Bomb Arrows, be sure to always keep a good distance while shooting. If you think you are going to shoot the ledge you are standing on, reposition. If you think you are too close to an enemy, backflip to gain more distance, or bait an attack to increase the distance. You do not want to take damage from yourself.

Hug the wall while you block attacks waiting for a horizontal slash to retaliate on. Get 3-4 stabs in the retreat to the wall. Repeat until armor falls off. Wait for him to close the gap, and wait for an attack.
