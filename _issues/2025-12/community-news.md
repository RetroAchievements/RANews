## RA Awards

The 5th annual RA Awards has started. The RA Awards are the community's opportunity to highlight their favorite sets, developers, contributors, and community members from the prior year. Check out the `# rawards-discussion` and `#rawards-voting` channels in Discord for more details.

## Hash Compatibility Testing

The QA-team is happy to announce a new process for hash compatibility testing! This allows users to help test hash compatibility for existing sets. You can work with the developer on testing new hashes while mastering the set to verify compatibility.

More information can be found in the docs at [Player Compatibility Testing](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/player-compatibility-testing.html).

## PlayTester Revamp

The PlayTester team has been revamped in order to expand the team and its current capabilities. Playtest requests can be submitted and discussed via Discord in the new forum channel.

Reach out to {% rauserpic TimeCrush %} for more information.

## Cheat Investigation

We've started an official cheat team and created the dedicated account {% rauserpic RACheats %}.

If you suspect anyone may be cheating or see suspicious scores/times, you can send a DM to that account and the team will look into it.

## Official RA YouTube

The official [RetroAchievements YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@retrocheevos) has passed 1,000 subscribers. We're looking for users who may already have videos or would like to make videos to contribute to the channel.

Type of content we're looking for:
- "What is RetroAchievements" - A Channel Intro video showcasing what the website is all about!
- Emulation Tutorials,
- Developer Tutorials,
- Achievement Guides,
- Announcement Videos,
- Reviews,
- Top 10's
- ...and more!

## Site Updates

### RAWeb 2025.11.14
**New Features**
- Turkish and Portuguese (pt-PT) are now available as selectable locales on your settings page.
- The beta game page now allows you to sort leaderboards by your highest and lowest rank.
- You can now see when any account is muted or banned, both on their profile and the forum.
- You can now use /game/X?set=Y URLs on the forum to easily link to beta game page subsets.

**Highlights for Developers**
- We've put the dev links on the beta game page into a new "Contribute" dropdown that's kinda similar to the "Dev" dropdown on game1.

**Announcement**
- The beta game page is now considered a Release Candidate. We're continuing to work through a final round of changes and bug fixes, and the page will continue to see even more enhancements over time. However, for our next major release, we'll be saying goodbye to game1 as the default game page on the website. It'll remain in the codebase for a little while longer as an opt-in only feature until being removed altogether sometime in very early 2026.

- Throughout the beta, we received extremely helpful feedback from the community. Your feedback helped shape what game2 is today, as well as fix numerous bugs we ourselves didn't discover during our internal testing. The hubs and leaderboards UI looks very different now than it did from the first beta, thanks in large part to your feedback.

- We've received 500+ detailed entries from people using the "Give Beta Feedback" button. Of the beta feedback, approximately 90% of players have given the page 4/5 or 5/5 stars.

- This was our first beta for a big new feature. We're looking forward to starting the next beta imminently - before Jan 2026.

[Full release notes here](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/releases/tag/2025.11.14)

### RAWeb 2025.11.25
**New Features**
- You can now report forum posts, wall comments, and incoming DMs to the mod team using a new "Report" button.
- Subsets no longer count towards your "Unfinished" game count. Additionally, per a recent update, they no longer count towards your average completion percentage.
- Some improvements have been made to the new game page's set selection controls to better support multiset.
- We've added a "Latest Site Updates" button to the home page to give users a quick list of recent site updates.

**Bug Fixes**
- We've (hopefully) fixed an issue where timestamps in the wrong language were sometimes appearing. If this continues to happen, please report it to us!
- We've also (hopefully) fixed an issue where browser back/forward buttons were misbehaving on the new game page.
- When viewing a subset on the new game page, refreshing will persist your "Missed Only" and "Locked Only" filters correctly now.
- The Rarity tooltip label on new game pages now renders correctly.

## Emulator Updates
### RANes 1.2
- Supports future split of FDS into a separate console
- Includes two years of upstream changes
- Downloading the integration DLL now shows a progress dialog

**RetroAchievements is now available for Dolphin Emulator on Android.**

- RetroAchievements is now supported in Dolphin for Android's development builds and is ready for the community to use.

- You can now earn achievements for GameCube games on your Android devices, with Wii/WiiWare on the way & landing early next year!

**Important Details**
- This feature is currently available in development builds only (version 2509-503 and later).
- Consider this an open beta. We've tested it internally, but with hundreds of players now available to stress test it, there will likely be issues we haven't discovered.
- The achievement list for the game you're playing isn't visible yet. That's still WIP and will be added in an upcoming emulator update.
- A stable release of Dolphin for Android with RetroAchievements support is planned soon.

**How to Get Started**
You can access development builds in two ways:
- Download the latest 2509-503 Android development build directly from this URL, OR
- Opt into the Dolphin Emulator beta/open testing program on the Google Play Store. It may take a few hours from this post for the new build to be available over there.

- If you experience any issues, please report them to ⁠tech-support . Your testing and feedback will help us ensure a smooth experience for everyone when this feature lands in an upcoming stable release.
