## Boku no Natsuyasumi: Summer Holiday 20th Century (PlayStation)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Console     | Genre                                                                                                         |

Boku no Natsuyasumi (a pun title that translates both to My Summer Vacation and Boku's Summer Vacation) follows Boku, a 9 year-old boy in 1975 spending his summer in the Japanese countryside with his grandparents. There's been a lot of stir these past few years about "cozy games", and this is one of the OGs. In it, you'll spend your days doing morning calisthenics, exploring the forest paths, catching bugs and fish, eating meals with your family, and basically chilling the hell out. If that sounds like [Animal Crossing](https://retroachievements.org/hub/18394), I think it's fair to say that drew heavy inspiration from this. Its painted environments are reminiscent of the works of Studio Ghibli and are a complete joy to look at, and the subdued sound design complements it perfectly. Put simply, folks, the vibes are impeccable. The game has never been released outside Japan, and only its [sequel](https://retroachievements.org/game/20646) (which we do have a set for) has been translated to English. But the original deserves some spotlight too, and I hope someone with a lot of patience and/or Japanese language skills can take it on someday.

Cars is the definition of a good movie adaptation game (even though it doesn't adapt the plot of the movie lol). Let me say it straight: I love racing games, and Cars absolutely delivers! This game is the perfect adrenaline rush – an explosive mix of speed, fun, and pure nostalgia. Ka-chow!

Think it’s just a kids' game? Think again! There's more to do here than in some big-name AAA titles: intense races, tons of unlockable characters and skins, and a wild variety of minigames that’ll keep you hooked for hours. The Story Mode? An absolute beast! With 250 collectible trophies scattered across a massive open world, this game offers a real challenge – especially when you're diving in blind. Every area is packed with secrets, making it feel like so much more than just a racing game.

But the real star is the gameplay: floor the gas, boost your way to glory, jump over obstacles, or even drive completely backwards – yep, backwards! It won’t make you faster, but it opens up some crazy fun challenges for achievement hunters. And as if that’s not enough, there’s even a hidden hard mode! Just enter the name “CHMPION” and get ready to sweat. Cheats included, of course.

To me, Cars is a timeless classic that still holds up today. A true hidden gem that deserves way more recognition – especially in the form of a proper RetroAchievements set! If I had the skills, I’d build it myself. So here’s the deal: Don’t sleep on this banger of a game! It’s a must-play for any racing fan, packed with charm, challenge, and pure lightning-fast joy.

Ka-chow – now hit the track!

## Sid Meier's C.P.U. Bach (3DO Interactive Multiplayer)

A few years ago I fell in love with the Fugue form, so I downloaded almost all of them from [imslp.org](https://imslp.org/) to play. As this type of composition fell from grace after the Baroque, there aren't that many. Then I started to think that it shouldn't be very hard to make a program to generate Fugues following composition rules from the time and RNG(*). Well, [Sid Meier](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7334) (in between the making of some strategy bangers) and Jeff Briggs beat me to it by more than 20 years.

This gem of a software generates continuously not only fugues, but other 15 forms of music from the Baroque, in 7 different "moods" and with 12 instruments. You can select 5 visual representations, like Bach himself playing the instruments or showing the musical notation and some explanations.

The game starts to create from the get go, and if you want you can open the menu, select the "mood", and then modify the frequency (more notes, more common) of generation of each form, and within each form the frequency of the instruments that will play it. You can save any composition in one of 15 slots to hear them again, skip the song by pressing right, or increase or decrease the tempo with up and down.

Of course, it lacks the freedom that an actual composer may have. It seems very rigid with the rules for each form of music, without being able to change the speed or style mid track, except for the fantasias that seem more flexible.

Unfortunately, a set for this game would go directly into the [meme sets](https://retroachievements.org/hub/9017) hub, as there is nothing else to do but listen to music, and people would fast forward their way into mastery. But at least it would serve for people to know about this amazing software and to get a pretty cool badge from the GOAT JS Bach.

## Slither Link (WonderSwan)

Slither Link is a logic puzzle game for the WonderSwan that plays like a cross between [Minesweeper](https://retroachievements.org/hub/21371) and the Dots and Boxes game. The game area is filled with equidistant dots, some of which have numbers inside them. The numbers correspond to the number of walls that surround the box containing the hint. Your objective is to create a closed loop of walls in the play area using these hints.

This game is perfect to pick up and play in short bursts, and is well suited for the WonderSwan. The lack of colors does not detract from the core gameplay, and the timer system encourages leaderboards. Making an incorrect mark will subtract time from the timer, but will allow the player to test out their logic if desired. The game also features 6 difficulties, giving players plenty of content to explore.

A campy combination of B-movie horror and FMV novelty, Night Trap is one of the most infamous titles in gaming history. Players monitor security cameras in a lake-side house, springing traps as they attempt to stop vampiric “Augers” from abducting the teenage guests — all while juggling split-second decisions and following a story that feels like a fever dream.

I adore Night Trap, both as a game and a charming time capsule. The silly yet strangely-endearing theme song still gets stuck in my head, and seeing the late Dana Plato in the role of undercover agent Kelli always feels a bit bittersweet. It’s clunky and strange, but it remains bravely committed to its own weird vision (at least, as much as the censors would allow).

The 3DO version of Night Trap stands out as an enhanced experience compared to its [Sega CD](https://retroachievements.org/game/17011) counterpart: it features the highest video clarity, fastest camera switching, and superior audio quality. Aside from the modern Switch and PC ports, the 3DO remains the best version to showcase with achievements.

## Magical Drop II (Neo Geo CD)

[Magical Drop](https://retroachievements.org/hub/9465) is a series of games where you pop bubbles. No, not that one. For those unfamiliar, [Bust-A-Move/Puzzle Bobble](https://retroachievements.org/hub/6951) might be the easiest comparison, but the big difference in how they play is speed. Whereas Puzzle Bobble is slow and methodical, Magical Drop is a much more fast-paced experience where you grab balls and shoot them back out.

That said, I'm here to wish for a specific version of Magical Drop II, the Neo Geo CD version specifically. Because the game as a whole does have a set, that being the [SNES](https://retroachievements.org/game/2373) port, but that one is, frankly speaking, bad. It also only saw a Japan release as well, for people who care about their puzzle game lore. But then, what about the Arcade port that did see an English release? Well... the English version just removed a lot of stuff from the game, like most character voices, game modes, etc. In comparison, the Neo Geo CD version is mostly faithful to the Japanese version, and is an improvement in general. All of this is to say, it's a shame that the only way to experience the game on RA is far from the best.

Let's ignore that Magical Drop 1 has no sets yet.

Attack of the Mutant Penguins is a rather strange game for the Atari Jaguar. It has you take control of a character that goes around collecting these gremlin creatures that you use to break open treasure chests and repair traps in order to hinder the mutant penguins from making it to the doom scale. If too many make it, then you lose.

The whole vibe of this game is a sort of tower defense game. You quickly gather gremlins to open chests to gain your weapon to dispose of all these cumbersome penguins. Once you succeed in a stage, you get to play one of three mini-games. These are quite fun and would be a great addition to the set by adding extra challenges, like completing the [Space Invaders](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8035) type one in a certain amount of time, in penguin range only, or limiting you to miss a certain amount of penguins before the game ends.

The overall premise of this game is quite fun, and having achievements forcing you to limit the amount of gremlins you use or preventing use of any traps and only using your weapon could introduce a challenging game-play loop that forces you to be more aware of your positioning and would be a blast to play through!

The other mode, Pandemonium, is the same as the basic mode, but instead of going level to level, you try to survive as long as you can on one endless level. Achievements could include surviving a certain amount of time or killing a certain amount of penguins, which would be a really fun challenge, as the waves get rather hectic and the overwhelming amount of penguins would keep any player on their toes.

Overall, while this game is not as complex as other tower defense games, it still provides a fun experience and has a good opportunity to make challenging but fair achievements that'll provide a good incentive for experiencing all this weird game has to offer. I hope to see a set for this game someday, as it would be a great addition to the site!

Yes, I get it, this isn't really a "game" at its core, and never was intended to be. This is a tech demo for the GameCube, which was sent out to game developers to showcase the hardware capabilities of the GameCube, stuff like anti-aliasing or environment mapping. It's selling point, however (to the teeny tiny fanbase, if that exists), is the beautiful graphical presentation and the pretty good soundtrack, which still makes me sad sometimes that it's locked and forgotten behind this demo (the entrance-theme is a very pretty piece of music, and the others don't suck either). There's also a few activities you can attend to in this demo, be it gazing at the graphics, interacting with the models, hitting the coin block in the white screen room, and just a little bit more. It's definitely a demo that's worth experiencing at least once to see how the GameCube was advertised to developers. It's really a cute little piece of history, and that's why I think it deserves a set. I'm sure the devs can cook up something fun for this small demo.

With that said... "Welcome to GameCube World!!"

I have memories of good times playing Marc Ecko’s Getting Up. Having respect and appreciation for the pillars of hip-hop, I had a feeling that the game would weave that spirit into a unique gameplay experience. I was grateful that the game met my expectations. The hip-hop element isn’t heavy-handed, but instead the game relies on a never-done-before system, particularly with the utilization of creating visual art. In order to “get up” on public structures, the game challenges the player to ninja sneak around adversaries to clear a safe, albeit limited, window of time to make designs. Think [Metal Gear Solid](https://retroachievements.org/game/11244), but in an urban landscape with relatable characters. Of course, there’s an overtone of governmental resistance / defiance of law. A bit campy, but I don’t mind it. After all, public surfaces are being “defaced”.

All in all, a one-of-a-kind game that ties the radical nature of a prohibited activity with ninja-like player control, an excellent soundtrack, and education. Yes, knowledge. Before playing this game, I didn’t know wheat paste could be used in the creation of art. Hope this game gets a set!

Battle Golfer Yui is a quirky game that was truly ahead of its time, combining an RPG, golf, and visual novel game into one unique title.

You play as the titular Yui, a high school golf prodigy playing in a golf tournament - but not just any golf tournament. This tournament is secretly a front by a mad professor who plans to take over the world with brainwashed golfers (probably not the first type of athlete I would think of for an unstoppable army, but hey, if it works…). As Yui, you compete against rivals, level up your golf stats and abilities, and investigate people and places visual novel-style to save the world.

If that didn’t tell you already, this game is very “anime”. The plot is whacky with an overdramatic 90s anime flair, the greens incorporate unusual courses such as baseball fields and a guitar-shaped island, and even the golfing involves abilities and “spells” that would feel at home in a JRPG. The graphics are fairly impressive, using detailed portraits and slightly-animated cutscenes regularly. The game feels very much like the ancestor to the beloved [Mario Golf](https://retroachievements.org/hub/457) handheld games.

If you’re looking for a golf game a little less stuffy than the usual golf sim fare or always wondered what it would be like if Tiger Woods or Nelly Korda mixed secret agent activity with golf, this game is worth a trip to its bizarre links.
