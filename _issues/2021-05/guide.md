## 2) Introduction

Pokémon Snap is a rail shooting game based on photographing Pokémon. The game was released on the Nintendo 64 in 1999. The purpose of the game is to take photos of Pokémon in various stages with the ultimate goal of being able to photograph Mew. You gain points based upon the size of the Pokémon in the photo, the pose, plus various other special features and you want to aim for the highest score possible.

## 3) Walkthrough

**Step 1**

The walkthrough for this game is fairly straight forward. There are no missable achievements as you can go back into each stage at any time. So Really, you should be able to just play through each level, taking shots of various Pokémon. One thing to take note of, there are several things that can happen with the items and such, or even just taking pictures. For example, for Pikachu on a ball or to be able to get Muk, you need to take photo graphs of the Pokémon, or other Pokémon to be able to meet the conditions to make these achievements trigger. So really, your first step is really to play the levels, get the items, unlock the other levels, then take more pictures. The following are the achievements you should aim to go for:

[Through Rock Tunnel](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/70541)

[Over the Volcano](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/70542)

This one can be a little tricky. The easiest way to do this is with Mew at the end as you get a lot of points for Mew. But if you are going for this before you get there, the best was is to use special poses, or find a spot where you can get a picture with lots of the same Pokemon in there while filling the picture to get a decent size score.

Do not confuse the Ditto Bulbasaur in the Cave for this, you can only get this achievement on the River course. There is a spot on the left where you will see some Bulbasaur on some logs. Use the apples to lure them out of the logs and try to get them to fill as much of the picture as possible, they will even dance/do tricks a little, this can earn you lots of points.

_Submit a photo of Larpris worth 3,000 points._

This one is very tricky because on the Beach, Lapras always seems so far out. However, there is a bit of a trick. When you take a picture of Lapras, it will move closer the next time you get to an area beside the water so anytime you can, snap a photo of it and it will eventually be very close. I usually found about 4 areas where I could see them on the right to get a good sized one near the Kangaskhan.

_Submit a photo of Mew worth 10,000 points._

This is fairly hard to do. Mew is the only Pokemon in the Rainbow Cloud and you need a perfect picture. You need to knock it shield around first and then when it comes from behind, you need to hit it so it gets stunned, keep hitting it until it is in front of you. You need it close enough to see it's pose before it disappears, plus it's biggest size. Keep hitting it, when you think it is close enough, start spamming the pictures and hopefully it will strike it's pose and you'll get it while it filled the picture.

_Complete the Valley Challenge._

These challenges are all about getting lots of pictures on your run though the course. There are two factors here, the point value for the shot you took and then the number of Pokemon species you photographed in the run, including signs. So, the strategy to these is to take a picture of as many different Pokemon/signs you can which will act as multipliers to the score, but then also the point value of the shots so take them in their best poses and such. The goal to hit is to get at least 1,510,000 points in the course through all pictures taken. So take the best shots, and as many different Pokemon as you can to get the highest multiplier that you can get.

This one is mostly the same as the other Challenge Scores however, there is only one Pokemon and it's Mew. So, the best way to do this is to get as many photos of Mew as possible. To get good ones, use the same strategy as the _The Genes of All_ achievement but use your entire camera roll. With that strategy, it shouldn't take long to get this.
