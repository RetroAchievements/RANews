# Episode 26 - Long Live The King

By the very nature of this community, competition tends to be at the forefront. Whether you take gaming seriously, or approach it with a casual indifference seeking enjoyment, at the end of the day we all find ourselves ranked either high or low amongst our peers. 

The higher you climb, the more prolific and defining that aforementioned rank denotes. With daily call-outs and gauntlets being thrown down across the board from Discord to the Forums, even directly on users walls, the bounty on your position ever-grows the more clout you accrue. 

Back in February the crown was placed on a new head - the challenger who rose and seized the throne, but how long will he reign? - as they used to say, "Kill the King, the King is Dead; Long Live the King". For exactly that reason, I have our returning guest here tonight, {% rauserpic Sarconius %}, to dig in on their journey to the top, how life has been treating them since our last episode together, and otherwise have a good time.
