## Game & Watch: Manhole & Helmet (Nintendo DSi)

It's time for more [Game & Watch](https://retroachievements.org/hub/10685)! This time I'm reviewing both games in the Gold series of Game & Watch titles. In general, this series of games introduced the ability to regain lives when reaching 200, 500 or 800 points; otherwise, the functionality is the same.

Starting off with Manhole - your goal is to let the people pass along to the other side of the screen. If you let anyone fall, you lose a life. Game B is about the same as Game A, but faster and with more people coming.

And then there's Helmet, in which you must get to the house on the right side while avoiding tools falling from the sky. You can only enter the house if the door is open, which gives a huge amount of points. There's also a safe space after getting to the door in which you can stay for a short time. Game B is the same, just with more stuff to avoid.

The achievement lists for both games are about the same as the Silver series, only really having high score achievements for the most part. However, Manhole has a few no miss achievements, which gives the set a bit more variety. The hardest achievements for Manhole are [Game B Master](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/440440) and [Flawless Game B](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/440959), and the hardest for Helmet is [To Ensure a Safe Working Environment](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/346151).

This is a great set with great achievements that involve everything in the game: finishing the game on Normal and Hard, doing the secondary missions, maximizing your characters, doing 100% of the stages, unlocking the Navigators as playable characters, etc. A negative point of the set that is more the fault of the game itself is requiring no damage in the stages. This was something that I found a bit annoying at first, but then I got over it and got it. Another negative point in my opinion is doing each boss without taking damage with each character, which is very tiring, but on the bright side it can be done in the boss rush. Another thing that held me for a while was the AAA ranks in the stages, which can be a bit boring to do, but with some dedication you can do it.

The hack Mario 64 B3313 is a unique and very strange take on the beloved classic. It offers a fresh, more challenging experience for those looking for something new and creepy. However, it may not appeal to everyone due to its "hard" difficulty and the 460 stars! Fans of ROM hacks and Mario games and those looking for a new and more challenging Mario experience will likely enjoy it. It's my favorite hack of all time.

This game is an absolute masterpiece in my opinion. It starts out with your character going to an opera, and the operatic score is fantastic, it's honestly what got me into classical music as a kid. Through the whole game it has this kind of techno-opera mix going, kind of reminiscent of that one scene from "The Fifth Element", and it really gets you jazzed.

The combat is fluid and engaging, even if you aren't particularly into RPGs, due to you having more control over your character and dodging attacks being completely up to you.

The cutscenes actually hold up extremely well for a PS1 game, and the rat transformation scene at the beginning actually looks more like something from a PS3 game in my opinion.

The story is actually quite original while not being too esoteric. While it's technically a sequel to a Japanese book, you don't have to even know that fact, let alone have read the book, to understand the plot. The game itself only references "something like this happened in Japan" and kind of leaves it at that for the references to the book.

I was pleasantly surprised by Wacky Races, both on its premise and gameplay. This game is based on the eponymous show "Wacky Races", which was a show that I watched a ton when I was still a young boy...

You play as Muttley, trying (and failing) to help Dick Dastardly in three different scenarios: Hip Hop, Splish Splash, and Go Go America. The former two scenarios are made of 3 stages, and 4 stages for the latter one. Each stage is made of a themed platforming stage made of multiple scrolling screens, followed by a two-stage boss battle. Over the course of the stages, you can find bones, which allows Muttley to power up in different ways depending on how many bones he has collected (working akin to [Gradius](https://retroachievements.org/game/1722)):
* Bomb: Muttley replaces his melee bite attack with a lobbing bomb attack, starting from above him and leaving a lingering hitbox on impact.
* Bow: Muttley replaces his melee attack with a piercing bark, traveling straight ahead and going through walls. However, it has starting lag.
* Wing: Muttley becomes able to float in the air by repeatedly pressing the jump button. However, you lose this power on death.
* Heart: Muttley heals back up to full, and gains an additional heart of health (up to 6 hearts). You keep those on death, but lose them on a game over.

This game is quite special gameplay-wise, for two reasons: for one, you have infinite continues. This means that anyone is able to clear the game, even the younger audience. Secondly, the patterns of the bosses aren't randomized like many platformers, but they are fully deterministic, akin to [Mega Man](https://retroachievements.org/hub/9185) bosses.

The set itself is quite simple: beyond the progression achievements which requires you to beat every stage, there are 2 achievements to get a total of 10/20 lives at once, as well as an achievement to collect 99 gems (the equivalent of coins in this game), and an achievement to increase your health to 6 hearts. Finally, there is an achievement for each boss, to be done at full health (in other words, at the final blow, to have 6 full hearts, no less). In total, there are 24 achievements, counting the progression ones.

## The Adventures of Batman & Robin (SNES/Super Famicom)

The Adventures of Batman and Robin is one of the best SNES games and one of the best [Batman](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7597) games ever made (second only to Batman: Arkham City in my opinion).

It has great sentimental value for me, as I loved this game as a child. However, I found it very difficult and was never able to get past the Poison Ivy stage. When I got to know RetroAchievements, this was the first game I managed to master.

The first thing you have to bear in mind is: the game is difficult, perhaps too difficult. However, it's an extremely fluid game, and you have a large arsenal of gadgets at your disposal. Don't hesitate to use a guide in this game, see which items are best in each stage, and watch walkthroughs. The game is difficult at first, but it's a quick game to learn how to play. And as the game is short, you won't get bored.

What's more, the game features lots of Batman villains, so if you're a fan of the superhero universe you'll be very pleased with what they've presented here. The variety of scenarios and stage styles is also insane. Sometimes it's possible to use the Batmobile - they're simple stages, but very cool ones!

Speaking of the set of challenges, the developers deserve congratulations. The set is really very good. It uses all the qualities of the game, and you'll be very satisfied once you've mastered it. I recommend playing it three times to master it: the first time using passwords, the second time in one playthrough, and the third time on Hard.

Once again, I recommend using YouTube for some achievements. Especially the no damage achievements and beating Catwoman in a race can be quite difficult, but they become easy with a few simple tricks.

Don't be alarmed by the retro ratio either. I think it's very high because it's not such a popular game and few people have tried to master it. It's a difficult game, but there are many much more difficult sets with lower retro ratio, such as the [Mega Man](https://retroachievements.org/hub/9185) franchise.

## Action Man: Robot Atak (Game Boy Advance)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Console          | Genre                                                                                                      |

Personally I had never heard of this game. If I had looked at it a while back, I probably wouldn't have started the game. RA has opened my eyes a lot, and [Achievement of the Week](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=29289) has proven to me that hidden gems are everywhere! This game is a must try for fans of run & gun series! With checkpoints sprinkled everywhere and the ability to mow down enemies by holding down the action button when you get a weapon, it makes for a fantastic time! If you just play the game for what it is, you are only looking at around an hour to an hour and a half of gameplay for Beat status, but mastery comes with a whole separate package.

To master this game you are going to need to factor in a few things. A lot of the achievements either can use passwords or not, so I broke it down for myself into 4 playthroughs:
* 1. Normal playthrough to the end
* 2. Advanced playthrough
* 3. Timed playthrough
* 4. Finish up challenges
When you do 1-3 you can not use passwords and have to do it all in one playthrough. It is a challenge, but if you break it down into those four playthroughs you should have a better time without burning yourself out. When you do the challenge run you can use passwords and reset the level if you fail that challenge, making for easy reset versus the actually run playthroughs!

This game is just stupid fun, the feeling of a 90's action movie, going from riding jet skis one scene to fighting a T-Rex the other, you never know what to expect! If you want some good fun with an easy time just for Beat status, I would recommend this game, but if you are going for the mastery expect to be pushed to the limit to get that sweet Action Man badge!

This is a solid set that can be mastered in a day. The game is pretty straightforward, and as long as you take your time you shouldn't really miss anything. The only things that need to be watched out for are the auto-scroll levels. These ones might take a couple times through to get all gold coins and Greek urns. There are only 4 in the whole game, but they're not too difficult to get through. I will say the [Hard Labors](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/133888) achievement will take some luck for the Medusa boss level, but that is really it. The luck is that taking damage in that level is random, and getting all hits on Medusa takes a while since she takes damage from her own attack; just do your best to get health when you can. Overall, an easy game to beat, and not too hard of a mastery to get.

I'm a huge motorsport fan, so naturally, I love playing games like Forza or [Gran Turismo](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8319). And I absolutely enjoy it, especially the newer racing games. Precise throttle control, adjusting tire pressure depending on what's needed, and always keeping an eye on brake temperatures -those are the things I love.

Fun racers? Too simple for me! I never really liked them. Maybe [Flatout 1+2](https://retroachievements.org/hub/3187), but that’s about it. Then a friend of mine said to me, "You should play Diddy Kong Racing!" "Alright, alright, chill. Fine, I’ll give it a try". At the time, I had no idea it was part of the Christmas event.

So, I jumped into Diddy Kong Racing. The start was rough. I complained about it, but I stuck with it because somehow...somehow, it wasn't [Mario Kart](https://retroachievements.org/hub/13352). It wasn't too hard, and it wasn't too easy, and suddenly, my competitive side kicked in. At first, I was completely clueless, but I gradually got the hang of it. I started earning achievement after achievement. Sometimes it was easy, but other times it really challenged me — more often than I had expected.

Here, it wasn't about adjusting tire pressure or how much I pressed the throttle - it required a completely different skill set. I had to see how I could improve myself; I had to work on my own abilities. It was similar to Forza in some ways, but also entirely different.

It gave me the same feeling I had back in the day when I spent days - no, weeks - pushing my BMW Z4 GT3 to its limits in Forza Motorsport 4, shaving off milliseconds lap after lap. Suddenly, I loved Diddy Kong Racing, and the set perfectly reflected my learning curve.

Collecting all the stars, beating T.T.’s times..."Wait, there are developer times I need to beat too?" Oof.

Today, I still have a few achievements left to master the set, but my determination is unwavering. Maybe I was a bit rusty, and my racing skills have dulled a bit since Forza 4. I'm sure many of you played it as part of the Christmas event and made up your own mind about it. For everyone else, I can only recommend giving it a shot because it's a wonderful game with amazing maps, an absolutely banging soundtrack, and a very balanced and well-thought-out set.

This was my first entry into the [Phantasy Star](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8541) franchise, and honestly I do not know what it is about the game, but it is incredibly addictive. There are lots of different kinds of weapon drops to farm, a pretty steep difficulty that is still learnable (as in, it is not unfairly difficult, you just need to get better with time), pretty deep mechanics for your character, and so on. I am enjoying it a lot, and hopefully will master it one day. There is one achievement for beating the "Eternal" quest, which is like a 4 hour dungeon scroller; I have done it on Normal so far, but there are still cheevos for Hard and Super Hard. These are the only ones I am not looking forward to. Also, the game has NO missables, which is pretty rare in this kind of RPG. Can highly recommend!
