Is that a stealth 3d platformer based on the 2006 animated heist comedy film of the same name, based on a syndicated comic strip written by Michael Fry, and featuring an incredible soundtrack by Ben Folds, "Over the Hedge"? Why, yes it is, how did you know? Collect food and items to stop Gladys from destroying your home by convincing a variety of endangered animals to live in the forest. This set highlights all of the best moments from the game and includes a plethora of challenges to really make sure you show who's top of the food chain.

SWE1R is a 1vs1 topdown racing game based on the fictional "podracing" competition featured in the referenced movie title. To pay homage to this high-intensity sport, the achievement set draws a lot of inspirations from the scenes shown in the movie, but also aims to really teach players the fun and depth of this rather simplistic, yet challenging spin-off title. Mastering this set will prove you that this game is a lot more than just a runner-up to the N64 adaptation.

If you like a good 2D platformer (and who doesn't), here's a new one for you to check out! FX Unit Yuki: The Henshin Engine for Mega Drive has you playing as Yuki Shirokawa, an apprentice at the Jipang Electronics Corporation. When she discovers a crazy secret about her favorite gaming console, her life changes. The game features eight stages that reference classic games such as Bonk's Adventure, Castlevania, and Wonder Boy in Monster World, and iconic power-ups like Charged Shot, Slide, and a Double Jump (all of the platforming mainstays), and several different endings. With all of this and more, do you have what it takes to master this set?

|      | {% ragamepic 2532, 105773, Pac-Man World %} | {% rauserpic Empovyle %} | {% rauserpic cdpowe %} | 3/8/2025     |

Pac-Man World is a simple and fun platformer that took some risks by implementing a 3D space on a console usually dominated by 2D platformers. The set itself is short and sweet with a few challenges to keep you on your toes. If you have ever played the original version on the PlayStation and found yourself struggling with the difficulty, or maybe you just want more Pac-Man World, or perhaps you are interested in a quick mastery badge for your wall, this game would be a great pick-up.

In Carmageddon you win by racing or by wiping out the competition! Gain buffs or nerfs throughout the track, score points by running over zombified pedestrians, and play with several different racers and their cars. Expect challenges that will put your driving skills to the test, and some that are just plain silly. It's Duke Nukem if it was a racing game, action packed, edgy, and silly. So get the fastest laps and lower the population density!

| ⭐    | {% ragamepic 6639, 105810, Sonic Shuffle %} | {% rauserpic Crazeuh %} | {% rauserpic Layton %} | 3/24/2025    |

Sonic Shuffle is a Mario Party-like game (made by the same developers too!) where you stroll through five different boards to save Maginaryworld. Instead of a dice, you have an inventory of 6 cards, which you can choose to move a determined number of spots on the board. There are 8 different characters to play as, each having their own abilities. The goal of each game is to obtain as many emblems as possible by completing various objectives, collecting Precioustones, and completing each board's quests. This isn't your grandpa's party game!

Ready to blast off with a fun new set? Bomberman 64: Arcade Edition is a simplified version of Bomberman Land released for the Nintendo 64 that contains a variety of game modes for you to play with your favorite bomb-throwing robot. Sure, there's classic "Bomberman" gameplay, but also included is: "Panic Bomber", based on the puzzle-based 1994 Bomberman spinoff game of the same name; "SameGame", a tile-matching puzzle game; and "Bomberman Park", a mode where you explore an amusement park and play minigames and earn medals. How did we fit so much game in this set? Well, that's our secret.

|      | {% ragamepic 1704, 064842, Gauntlet II %} | {% rauserpic AshMetalRaf %} | {% rauserpic scatter %} | 3/28/2025    |

How can you get all the thrills of Gauntlet II to your very own home? Simple, just pick up the new NES version! With all the graphics, sound and features of the arcade original. Fight your way through dungeons while dodging traps and collecting power ups to stay alive. This set adds layers of extra depth, so if you enjoy fast action and old-school games, then checking out Gauntlet II.

In lieu of a review of this game (which is worth playing; you get to raise and train a dog of your choosing, as well as showering it with gifts and love; just play the game), what follows will be a list of every dog breed you can choose from for your *Dogz*. If you see the name of your favorite dog, congratulations, you are now required to play this set: Beagle, Border Collie, Chihuahua, Dachshund, Dalmatian, French Bulldog, Golden Retriever, Labrador, Maltese, Papillon, Pomeranian, Schnauzer, Shiba Inu, Shih Tzu, Toy Poodle, Welsh Corgi, Yorkie

|      | {% ragamepic 15537, 091924, Monkey Magic %} | {% rauserpic sikayduh %} | {% rauserpic Whithbrin %} | 3/30/2025    |

Sure, we all have a favorite new media adaptation of Journey to the West. On the count of three, name your favorite: 1- 2- 3- Monkey Magic. Oh, you said Dragonball? Weird, but okay I guess. Monkey Magic is a PlayStation game based on an anime of the same name, featuring sidescrolling action with RPG elements. This game has a unique art style and a lot of depth. If you play this set, not only will you have a great time, but you will learn a lot about 16th century Chinese literature. If you were doing a book report on Journey to the West and you included what you learned, you'd get an A+. We're talking *guaranteed* A+. And that A+ just might get you into the college of your choice. Think about it.
