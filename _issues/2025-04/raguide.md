## About

:no_entry: **\*\* NOTE: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FOR SOLVING ACHIEVEMENT PUZZLES \*\*** :no_entry:

This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a simple guide for the current achievement set (198 as of 4/2/2025) available on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/11242). This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements and any other necessary or useful information.

**A note about spoilers**: Strategies and solutions for achievements as well as a potential order to earning them will be hidden in a collapsible entry that you must click to expand so that only the solutions you need assistance with will be viewable. Some of the more minor achievements will have strategies written outright without a collapsible dropdown so use the guide at your own risk.

## Introduction

Final Fantasy VII is a role-playing video game developed by Square for the Sony PlayStation. It was released in Japan on January 31, 1997, North America on September 7, 1997, and Europe on November 17, 1997. This seventh game in the series followed suit with Final Fantasy VI in eschewing the fantasy aspects and focused more on the science fiction side of the series. The story centers on a mercenary who aids an eco-terrorist group fighting back against a global electric power company that is consuming the planet's life essence and coming to terms with the force from the stars that ravaged an ancient civilization and continues to persist via a genetically modified super soldier. Many of the mainstays of the Final Fantasy series continue to appear here: chocobos (now with even MORE colors), summon beasts, an airship, recurring monsters (malboros, cactuar, goblins, and so many more), and lots of weapons and skills. Replacing the Esper system of FFVI is the Materia system, which imbues characters with specific magic, skills, stat boosts, and other effects when equipped to slots in a character's weapon and armor.

As with the other Final Fantasy games in the SNES era, this game will push you into situations that can lock you out of areas, characters, and abilities as you progress. As a result, many achievements for Final Fantasy VII will become missable if you are not diligent. With that said, nearly all achievements can be earned in one playthrough, with some notable exceptions. **Two playthroughs are required at a minimum**, specifically for the low-level challenge run of the game.

I played through the entire game using the DuckStation emulator with no issues. There were reports of problems with achievements unlocking with that emulator in the past but that seems to not be an issue any more. There was an issue involving fast forwarding when the disc speed is set higher than normal speed that causes some crazy shenanigans during combat or failing to load other areas. As long as you are on normal disc speed though, you'll be fine.

## Sources and Shoutouts

In playing through the game and making this guide for the achievement set, I used the [GameFAQs guide by bover_87](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/71240) to find all the items.  For the low-level playthrough to get the **David and Goliath** achievement, I formed my experience point plan by using [GarlandG's guide on GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/32536) as a starting point. Many many many comments from users playing the set on RetroAchievements were a great help in figuring out some of the achievements.

## Trivia

- Final Fantasy VII is widely considered to be THE game that brought the Japanese Role Playing Game (JRPG) style to the mainstream outside of Japan. It had the highest sales worldwide for the series at the time. Sony was a big player in the game's release in other regions, offering to help Squaresoft with the publishing, probably in hopes of increasing console sales in the competition with Nintendo and Sega.
- In the USA, in particular, there was a huge marketing push for the game, showcasing only the FMV segments in television commercials, like this one: https://youtu.be/QDz9A4ByHIQ?si=wZQ3xLO0T4ZsTdTq&t=40. This commercial aired during Saturday Night Live, The Simpsons, and other popular shows of the time. North America had the largest ad spending over the other regions in the world which likely helped in JRPGs gaining a foothold in the market with at least half of the $40 million going to that region alone.
- This was the first Final Fantasy to be released in PAL regions.
- After the release in Japan and in preparation for a worldwide release, Square created the "international" version of the game, which made improvements to the materia system and other menus, guardrails for the chocobo race track, more cutscenes involving Cloud's past, and aids for map navigation. Oh yeah, and two new superbosses were added as well. ðŸ™‚
- Much of the game is presented using mostly static (aside from occasional animations and light effects), two-dimensional, pre-rendered backgrounds that low polygonal character models walk around on. There are a couple of moments where characters can move around while full motion video (FMV) plays on screen as well. Only the world map itself is a three-dimensional locale that can be traversed.
- After the release of Final Fantasy VI, the development staff was experimenting to see what they could potentially accomplish with their next game on newer hardware. Using Silicon Graphics workstations, they created a technical demo called [Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPO7c_XmesU). Showing Terra with blonde hair, Locke, and Shadow facing off against a golem. It showcases dynamic camera angles that would be adopted by Final Fantasy VII's battles. The hardware to make it would end up being used to create the FMV sequences.
- All of the game's locales, script, character models, and logic are stored on all three discs. Only the FMVs are unique to each disc.
- When you obtain all four Huge Materia and store them in Bugenhagen's planetarium, the Huge Materia themselves resemble the crystals of the first game in the series, even sharing the color scheme for the elements that they represented (though those colors weren't used until the first remake for Final Fantasy I on the WonderSwan Color).

## Save Support

Final Fantasy VII uses the PlayStation memory card to hold save data with up to 15 save files per card. With emulators, you can create as many memory cards as you wish! DuckStation, the emulator I used for my playthroughs, provides an option for making unique memory card files for each game. Definitely turn this option on if you haven't already as it will make creating an archive of your progress through the game easier. This will provide a way for you to go back to points in time where you may have missed an achievement but now you won't have to do a full playthrough again to get it. I ended up filling up both memory card files with saves in my normal run and I even had to load an old save once for an event that I missed.

I have a specific strategy handling save files for [**David and Goliath**](#david-and-goliath-low-level-challenge) that I will describe in that portion of the guide.

## Compatibility

Currently this game has 3 unique ROMs (3 disc hashes per ROM) registered for it. View the linked hashes at the [Supported Game Files](https://retroachievements.org/game/11242/hashes) page.

Please view the [Final Fantasy VII Official Forum Topic](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=5572) for more details.

- **[Progression](#progression)**: 25 achievements earned naturally through the course of gameplay
- **[Challenge](#challenge)**: 34 achievements (**29 are missable**) that require special actions or attention during boss fights or other activities that are potentially difficult to achieve
- **[Characters](#characters)**: 21 achievements (**3 are missable**) that involve recruiting optional characters, obtaining a character's final equipment and limit breaks, or reaching certain milestones in combat
- **[Treasure](#treasure)**: 21 achievements (**16 are missable**) which require finding all treasure in given locations or obtaining certain rewards through optional requirements
- **[Cutscene](#cutscene)**: 12 achievements (**10 are missable**) which are rewarded for observing specific scenes or events in the game
- **[Minigame](#minigame)**: 25 achievements (**6 are missable**) which involve playing a game given by an NPC or one of the games at Gold Saucer, and succeeding in that game
- **[Side Quest](#side-quest)**: 20 achievements (**9 are missable**) for completing quests (or milestones toward the quest) that are off the beaten path and aren't required to finish the game
- **[Steal/Morph](#stealmorph)**: 12 achievements (**5 are missable**) for stealing items from specific enemies or morphing them into rewards
- **[Materia](#materia)**: 18 achievements (**13 are missable**) which require obtaining materia, using materia, or materia mastery
- **[Mutually Exclusive](#mutually-exclusive)**: 10 achievements (**all are missable**) are pairs of achievements where only one can be earned in a playthrough (or reverting to a previous save to get the opposite achievement)

Out of all of the achievements, **101 are missable**.

## Potential Order

The following is a breakdown of the order of achievements based on my personal playthrough. Note that this is only a potential order for you to follow and not a strict timing on when achievements should be unlocked, especially when mutually exclusive achievements are considered and how you may pair them with the **David and Goliath** low-level run. The main goal is to minimize the total number of playthroughs needed to two.

Each section is grouped under story achievements and hidden under a dropdown to avoid spoilers. If you want to see the achievements, **click on the arrow** next to each section to reveal the table. The dropdown names have the number of achievements in the section so that you can see at a glance about how many achievements you should have by the end of a section, if you were to follow my guide to the letter. If you want to see the entire thing without having to click the arrows, [checkout the fully expanded roadmap!](Final-Fantasy-VII-Roadmap)

<br>The tables only reveal when achievements can be earned and possibly missed. No strategies on earning the achievements are provided here, just the order I earned them in.

<summary>A Truly Grave Setback âž¡ Reminiscence ~ Scars Carved by Fire <b>(38/198)</b></summary>

- **NOTES**:
  - The second half of the **Killing Hope/Good Things...** pair of mutually exclusive achievements is only available after the Sector 7 collapse
  - The first part of the **Shinra Inc** treasure achievement takes place here, but won't be completed until MUCH later
  - The reason why **Moulin a Cafe** is missable is because of the poster in Shinra Headquarters so make sure to get it!
  - Your journey toward **The Possibility of Elemental Bliss** and **The Possibility of Beastmastery** begins here!
  - Another mutually exclusive pair starts here with the invasion of Shinra Headquarters: **The Elevator Champion/The Stairmaster**. Since taking the stairs is required for **David and Goliath**, I opted to get the second of the pair during the low-level run instead.
  - The treasure for **On the Outskirts** starts to be found here, but won't be completed until Disc 2 (it's not missable though)
  - The journey toward **Strago's Tribute** begins as soon as you depart Midgar

<summary>Reminiscence ~ Scars Carved by Fire âž¡ Battleready Stowaways <b>(50/198)</b></summary>

- **NOTES**:
  - Your journey toward **The Possibility of Avian Power** begins here!
  - Unlocking **DJ Chubby C. vs. Go Go Boco!** is flexible since it relies on the random appearance of Fat Chocobo over the usual attack from the Choco/Mog materia. I'm placing it here first but I unlocked it after Mythril Mine. Your unlock point may vary, obviously.
  - Fort Condor missions toward unlocking **Tower Defense 101** begins here! I used this opportunity to also get **Last Resort** in the first mission and then reset to get progress for **Tower Defense 101**.
  - The search for treasures going toward **Of Shores and Sea** begin here, but won't be finished until much later on.

- **NOTES**:
  - The search for the treasures toward the **Coal and Gold Miner** achievement starts here but won't be completed until a few sections from now
  - A lot of these are Gold Saucer minigames that can be completed at any time. With one exception, I tackled the minigames as they became available.
  - You'll start to collect the treasures for **Forestry and Mountain Travel** will start here as well but won't wrap up until near the end of Disc 2

- **NOTES**:
  - This is the soonest that Great Gospel can be learned and **Prayer** unlocked, and it is important to do so before it is too late
  - The Wutai side quest can be performed from now until near the end of Disc 2. I went there pretty soon after getting the Tiny Bronco to take care of it, but you can save it for later if you want. Just make sure to get it done before the Midgar Raid!
  - With your trip to Wutai, you'll start to collect the treasures toward unlocking **Ancient and Leviathan Goods**. You can't finish it until later in Disc 2.

  - You'll start getting treasures toward **At the Heart of Gaea** and will wrap it up soon

- **NOTES**:
  - Your first mastered materia, unlocking **Echoes of Creation**, could be earlier or later than this, obviously
  - You can start working toward **Expert Archaeologist** here but can't finish until after Cloud restores his personality
  - As with other character limit break achievements, Red XIII's could be learned any time. This one in particular is special because it could be learned as early as the first visit to Nibelheim, but I didn't unlock it until this point.
  - You'll find the first few treasures for **Deep Impact** in this section, but won't get the rest until Disc 3

<summary>Reminiscence ~ The Bitter Taste of Truth âž¡ Under the Sea <b>(140/198)</b></summary>

- **NOTES**:
  - One of the biggest sections, thanks to the chocobo breeding and associated racing and quests
  - Buying the house in Costa del Sol can happen anytime that you have the money, I just found this moment to be the most convenient
  - The last mutually exclusive achievements in the normal playthrough are here. Since you need to get the Huge Materia for a later achievement in this run (and the benefits it provides) and you need to win the submarine minigame in the low-level run, it's highly advisable to do both of these achievements in this playthrough by getting the red sub first, then resetting and going the regular route.

- **NOTES**:
  - A lot of cleanup and preparation for the end game requirements in this section
  - Getting **Madd Forest** can happen as soon as you have bred chocobos. I forgot about it until cleanup before entering Northern Crater so that is why it is here.
  - This is the end of the normal playthrough!

### Progression

No discussion on the progression achievements here as you simply need to play through the game to earn them. You can't miss them!

[Back to Achievement Categories](#achievement-categories)

### Challenge

As with my other guides, my strategies are not always the definitive way to accomplish a challenge and even not the most ideal way thanks to the flexibility of the game's combat and materia systems. If you have other strategies that may be better, more efficient, easier, etc., feel free to [DM me on RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp) and I can update the guide with credits given. Thanks and good luck!

Are you sure you can trust Cloud?<br><br><details>The first achievement and also first missable. Don't attack while the tail is up and this achievement will be yours.<br>The boss will take four rounds (two Search Scopes and two attacks) before raising it's tail so do as much damage as you can before that happens. When you get near the point when the tail will be raised, stop issuing commands (unless using items) and wait out the tail. Once the camera begins to shift back to the side view, you can start issuing attack commands again. If you are using Cloud's Bolt and limit breaks as they happen, you should be able to beat the boss before it can raise it's tail again.<br>Also, putting Barret in the back row is always a good idea since he is a ranged attacker, so you might as well do that here, especially if you are prepping for **The Great Escape**.</details>

In the Config menu, place ATB on Active, and Battle Speed and Battle Message to the far left for the fastest speed. ATB may not matter too much since we are just going to be running from battles, but I had it on Active anyway just in case. Active wasn't impactful to the Guard Scorpion fight either. Next, go to the screen where you fight Guard Scorpion, pick up the Restore materia, then go back a screen and save your game. Reset the console and reload. On the save crystal screen, walk around near the screen transition until you have two encounters. The first encounter will take a little bit to appear (it should be two Grunts and a Sweeper, in my experience). The second encounter will occur relatively quickly afterword (it should be a Sweeper, in my experience). Now, go fight Guard Scorpion.<br>After the battle, begin to run back through the reactor the way you came in. Save Jessie on the way to the elevator. If you were efficient in your movements, you should have your first of two encounters as you approach Jessie. When the battle transitions occur, hold onto the L1+R1 (top bumper buttons) to escape the battle. In my experience, this was a fight with two Grunts and two Mono Drives so it can seem like you might be in the fight for a little while but you'll still have plenty of time. My time at escaping this battle was 9:20.<br>In the room before the elevator, it's pretty easy to get caught on the railing for the stairs, but it shouldn't affect you getting out in time if you keep calm. In the elevator, press the button, close the dialog, and hold Left on the D-pad. Once the elevator stops, you'll run right out of the door easily. Talk to Jessie, then to Biggs. As you run toward the exit, your second encounter will happen (three Grunts). Then you are out of the door and the achievement will pop! My time was 8:02 with this strategy.</details>

Perhaps getting that ready ahead of time is the play.<br><br><details>The best way to prepare for this is to get into an encounter in the room just before the boss, where you found the Ether in the chest and pressed the buttons at the same time to open the door to the save crystal. During the preparation battle, simply let your party get attacked until all three have hit their limit breaks. Use the Cure spell or items to heal if needed. In my experience, I had an encounter with two Special Combatants and a Proto Machinegun to get my limit breaks. Save the game and then proceed to the boss.<br>Without any grinding, my party was all level 8, except Tifa at level 6. All three characters used their limit breaks right away and we took down Air Buster before it could take a turn. Air Buster may counter attack (it did, in my experience, against Barret's Big Shot), but that doesn't count as the boss having taken a turn.</details>

The easiest way to handle this is to simply tell Aerith to "Hold on a minute" (first option) and push barrels in the following order after telling her to wait: left, rear, and right. When Aerith makes it to the top of the stairs, the achievement will unlock.<br>If you don't get it with the normal run, you'll definitely need to do it for the low level run so it's not too big of a

|            ![Walter White from Breaking Bad](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/88705.png "The Ballad of Heisenberg")            | [The Ballad of Heisenberg](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81594)       | The true "challenge" here is to remember to use a Grenade for the fight with Rufus (or possibly even having one in your inventory). You can purchase a Grenade as early as Sector 5 Slums at the weapon shop near Aerith's House. Another chance to get some Grenades is from the shopkeeper at the base of the Sector 7 pillar during the attack on it, hiding near some scrap on the left middle of the screen. Yet another chance to get some Grenades is from the Sector 5 Slums weapon shop. Finally, if you didn't manage to buy a grenade or two, the Grenade Combatants you encounter in the first floor of the Shinra Building (if you opt to take the front door) can drop them.

Why'd it have to be giant magic snakes? That makes me sad... Can I prevent it from casting spells somehow and/or do damage over time?<br><br><details>There are a lot of strategies out there to be able to defeat the Midgar Zolom and get the Beta enemy skill early in the game. There was a lot of concerns about this in the comments, but since the fiend respawns in the swamp after it is killed by the party, Beta is not missable.<br>Using Barret's Mindblow limit break is a way to prevent Midgar Zolom from using Beta so that you can survive the fight. If you put the party in the back row, have a dedicated healer, putting Sadness status on everyone, and use magic to deal damage as well as inflicting poison with the Bio spell to deal damage over time, you pretty much have all the tools you need to succeed. The exact strategy I used was to cast Bio with Cloud to poison and do damage, Tifa used Matra Magic, and Barret healed and tanked while firing off Big Shots until the monster died.</details>

This is the way. The strongest (and luckiest) will persevere.<br><br><details>For this challenge, I used Cloud, Yuffie (both level 18), and Barret (level 16). All characters had all materia removed to increase HP and Strength stats, their strongest weapons equipped (stolen from enemies), and Carbon Bangles for armor. Every character had Fury status applied to get their limit break gauges filled faster as well and gauges were full prior to the fight. Some luck was involved with limit breaks having crits, and characters with lower HP getting bubbled and thus killed, but I managed to get the boss on my sixth try. Fast forward makes repeated attempts inconsequential. One issue I experienced in my first attempt was trying to heal myself with an item. That's a big no-no, because that is taking an action other than a limit break! Some people were grinding to unlock level 3 limit break techniques, which would make things easier, but boring. Good luck!</details>

Gongaga."](https://i.imgur.com/F1x1vcq.png)<br>Me? Gongaga. Let's stop there before we go to Cosmo Canyon...<br>Wait, what are the Turks doing here? We can't let them escape! We'd better take them both out at once.<br><br><details>Go to Gongaga, located in the forest containing wreckage south of Gold Saucer. Save outside of the forest beforehand, just in case. This can be missed if you go to Cosmo Canyon first, so make sure you stop at Gongaga first.<br>The key to this is that they BOTH have to be defeated. If one goes down, the other will run away in one turn. So, bust out the big enemy skills: Aqualung and Beta! Use other multi-target spells or summons if you have them as well, or just defend if a character can't hit both at once. Both Turks have 2000 HP so you can track the damage (Select+R1 is helpful in this scenario) and single target if they are getting close to 0 HP and you need to save MP for some reason. Overall though, not too tough.</details>

Well, we better be careful then. What else are the undead weak to?<br><br><details>You cannot use healing items and spells that result in instant death on the boss at all, not even on your party. This means that you can use Hi-Potions and the Cure spells. Other possibilities are to use summons, Beta (for Gi Nattak), Ice spells (for the Soul Flames), and regular attacks. If you have multi-target Cure spells, make sure to save them for your party if needed by shifting to single target. There is no save crystal before the boss fight so prepare yourself prior to entering the door to the north past the third Stinger. That complicates things considerably... Keep people healthy to avoid any characters dying or be aggressive and take out Gi Nattak quickly. I opted for the latter, ignoring the Soul Flames.</details>

When it puts up its fists, don't let it bully you. Show it your strongest offense and defense at this point.<br><br><details>Open the safe and start the fight with Lost Number. The requirements for this battle are that you have to be on Disc 1 (so you will have lower levels and equipment, potentially) and that you must fight the physical attacking half of the creature midway through the fight. This means that you must use physical attacks during the first half of the fight until the boss turns purple. Once purple, follow up with magical based attacks. Your strongest spells at this point are Beta or Aqualung. Big Guard is a must here as well to mitigate damage AND get more turns in between Lost Number's attacks. There is NO primed achievement notification that I noticed during this fight, so if the achievement didn't unlock when you land the killing blow, reset and try again. The other condition is that you cannot have paralyzed the boss (I assume that Stop counts toward this as well). Make sure your attacks and magic don't have an added paralysis effect!</details>

We'd have been hosed against the Materia Keeper without them! <br><br><details>While in the Gi Cave, fighting Sneaky Steps have a chance of dropping M-Tentacles, which cast Bio3 and a nearly 50% chance of causing poison status. If you have some Deadly Waste from your time in Midgar, those can be useful as well, but less so because of their 20% chance of inflicting poison. Getting Materia Keeper poisoned is required in defeating it with only items without it casting Cure2 on itself. This is because the poison damage does not cause the boss's AI script to advance. With 8400 HP, Materia Keeper will lose 262 HP for every poison tick.<br>If you happened to get a Mirror from Shinra Manor's Mirage enemies, you could use one to put Reflect on Materia Keeper to prevent it from curing itself and supplementing your own healing. If you have the Bolt Ring accessory from the old man who gives you Mythril near Junon, put that onto one character to ensure someone can survive and heal (preferably the one with the main Enemy Skill materia equipped). Use Lightning-Elemental materia on armor on another character as well to reduce damage. Back row all of your party. Sadness could help as well. Worst case, if you aren't able to proc poison with one or two Bio casting items and you don't have any other items to do the damage, just reset and try again until the poison status lands and then let

Palmer is quite weak though...<br><br><details>Prepare by getting the limit gauge filled up on all characters. By this point, you should have Aerith's Fury Brand, so if you are concerned that your party won't be able to do 6000 HP of damage with three limit breaks or withstand the attacks to build up the gauges again, try using Fury Brand to get four limit breaks easily. You could also just have a team of three attackers and use Hypers to put everyone in Fury status. As always, save before entering Rocket Town and initiating the fight in case things don't work right so that you can adjust your strategy. Another good candidate for the fight is Vincent's limit break since he automatically acts after transforming it won't count against the achievement's requirements. Vincent can just attack and everyone else stands by in the back row.</details>

Thankfully we have all of these healing items. Now to pull this flying fiend down to the ground!<br><br><details>This is required to be fought on Disc 1, so coming to Wutai right after getting the Tiny Bronco is a good idea. During this quest, you are going to lose all of your materia. Stealing Adaman Bangles prior to this trip to Wutai will help a lot (big defense improvement with only two materia slots). Having a lot of items on hand to provide healing, since you probably don't have any magic materia, will be necessary so stock up on Hi-Potions. Without magic and a restriction on limits, all you have is attack and item. If you got T/S Bombs (a gravity attack) from the Flapbeats in the Gold Saucer area, these will be very effective against Rapps. It may be worth it to head back there and stock up before losing your materia as you progress through Wutai. They take 3000 HP on the first use(Rapps has 6000 HP). You can use another to knock off an additional 1500 HP, leaving that much left to take out with other attack items, such as the Fire Veil and Swift Bolts you can purchase at the Wutai item shop or Right Arms you may have stolen from Bombs, or physical weapon attacks. Rapps' Aero3 spell will do a ton of damage though, so make sure to heal after those attacks.</details>

Gladly! I can do that well before I get stronger travelling with my new friends. I'll just make good use of all of my... I mean, OUR materia, especially that Enemy Skill materia we've been building up.<br><br><details>Yuffie solos the best fighters in Wutai, including her father. To get the achievement, this must be done during Disc 1 without leaving the Pagoda.<br>- My setup on Yuffie: Level 36. Razor Ring, Gold Armlet, Jem Ring first and White Cape or Headband later. Placed in back row with Sadness.<br>- Materia: Poison, HP Plus x2, Counter Attack, Enemy Skill, Lightning+Elemental, Gravity+Elemental.<br>- Items are the primary healing source.<br><br>- **Gorky**: Use Magic Hammer twice to prevent his magic attacks. The dive kicks remove a quarter health so using ???? can do a lot of damage. If the script goes right, Gorky should only get a Barrier off before both Magic Hammers, use Dive Kick up to twice, and try to do spells every other round. Once you use two Magic Hammers, simply spam ???? three times to win. Heal up after the fight and head upstairs.<br>- **Shake**: Easy. Use L4 Suicide. Shake will probably die to a counter attack. Otherwise, just attack afterword to win. Heal and proceed.<br>- **Checkov**: This fight is why we have Jem Ring on first. It might be tempting to use Magic Hammer to remove their MP, but the Jem Ring protects Yuffie from Stare Down and wastes their turns. Checkov will resort to Absorb only when MP runs out, so let them just spam Stare Down while you knock down their health with attacks. You could try to land poison too, but the chance seems low and physical attacks did more damage for me. Heal and proceed.<br>- **Staniv**: L4 Suicide and win again. Heal and proceed.<br>- **Godo**: Make sure you have swapped to White Cape or Headband for this fight. Headband is preferable because it protects against Sleep, but if you don't have it, the protection against Mini is good too. Cast Big Guard first thing for the haste benefit, then use Bio2 to try to get a poison proc'd on Godo. Use your limit breaks as they come up, then spells/summons/enemy skills/attacks as you wish. Godo's second phase involves him casting Cure2 as a counter. Magic Hammer can be used to eventually remove that capability from him, while restoring your own MP. ???? can also be helpful as your HP gets lower.<br><br>The achievement(s) will be unlocked upon the end of the cutscene after defeating Godo.

Will she decimate them all with their own skills? Will she survive our debilitating slots? Or will her ultimate limit break radiate peerless strength? Let's find out!<br><br><details>Getting the Keystone at Gold Saucer is the perfect (and final) opportunity to get this achievement. Use the save spot in Gold Saucer or on the world map outside North Corel to prepare. Equip Aerith with the Fairy Tale and strongest armor (I used Edincoat) plus any accessory that you feel works best. I opted to use the White Cape to mitigate any potential Frog or Mini status. I didn't try this, but I believe that you could just go into Temple of the Ancients and grab Aerith's Princess Guard as well as a Ribbon and then come back to Gold Saucer. Fairy Tale and White Cape we more than enough for this challenge though. At this point, if you wanted to get the **Prayer** achievement, you'll have Great Gospel which can really help in a pinch, so I recommend getting it unlocked, whether you need the **Prayer** achievement or not. For materia, magic materia is probably not the best, other than Heal (hopefully with Esuna by this point), Time (for Haste), and maybe Restore. Using HP Plus and Counter Attack with Long Range are a good bunch of Independent materia. Enemy Skill is an absolute must. Of course, keep in mind that any of these materia can get disabled in the slot machine handicaps so it is in your best interest to also have a stock of items to support the damage output and healing.<br>Be flexible and ready for anything as luck (and skill with the slots exploit) plays a HUGE part in this. If you are well stocked in items, you can probably brute force through it. I opted to use Sadness to reduce damage further in my playthrough and still got a filled up limit gauge when I took a big hit that might have killed me if not for Sadness. However, you can also put yourself in a Fury state to ensure you get more limit breaks if you wish. The final battle can be easy if you know the weaknesses (Ghirofelgo dies with one Laser, Dragon and Ying/Yang can be hit with L4 Suicide, Zuu is trickier unless you have some sort of Wind elemental damage but some Betas can take care of it).</details>

For tonight's special event, an ex-SOLDIER enters the arena to win a prize from Dio's collection. Can he survive through all eight teams? Will he just copy the flower seller's strategy? Let's get it on!<br><br><details>When doing the Battle Square fight for the Keystone, much of the strategy for Aerith's **Battle Symphony** challenge achievement apply here, except that you play as Cloud instead. In fact, I just moved all of my materia over to Cloud, forgot to put him in the back row, didn't put Sadness on him, and still won (though it got close with a Dragon finale). Again, adapt to the situations that are put in front of you with the slots (and make use of the slot exploit for more desirable outcomes, if you wish) and finish all eight fights to win the extra accessories from Dio and the achievement.</details>

|              ![An MC Escher-esqe labyrinth](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/211253.png "Ancient Steps Retraced")              | [Ancient Steps Retraced](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81611)         | This achievement has a notorious history. It has improved over time with less restrictions from the initial incarnation but is still challenging if not prepared. There is too many factors here to give a good hint on how to accomplish this so I'll just give general guidance here and then detailed notes on how I accomplished the challenge in the Spoiler dropdown.<br>The challenge itself isn't compatible with also trying to get all of the treasures for **Ancient and Leviathan Goods** so you'll need to do two runs through the Temple of the Ancients at least twice. You could do a treasure clearing run first to learn the efficient path through the dungeon first before attempting this challenge.<br><br>For the actual run, I recommend the following preparation:<br>- Change the cursor setting to Memory so that the Magic command is always selected in extended battles. It would suck to lose a fight because you accidentally hit Attack during a long battle (this can still occur at the start of a new battle though).<br>- Make a separate save for your challenge attempts. Reset the game before running through to deal with the same encounters every attempt and to know generally where encounters will occur.<br>- Use only tier 1 spells. MP cost scales higher than damage output.<br>- All characters should be in the back row with Sadness. Limit breaks cannot be used so the damage reduction from Sadness is vital.<br>- Picking up the Ribbon here is vital. Equip it on one character (I used White Cape on that character before hand), and use Jem Ring and Sprint Shoes on the other characters.<br>- Equip all of your magic materia, even those you won't use, in order to increase your MP and Magic stats. Poison will be your primary damage source for random encounters and Red Dragon. Fill in extra slots with Time materia (purchased in Rocket Town or Gongaga; in my case, I bought 20 of them) as they make a substantial boost in MP/Magic that is purchasable at this point in the game. You want one Time materia that is at level 2 with Slow. Equip one person will Heal materia with Esuna on your Ribbon equipped character (keep in mind that Esuna does remove Sadness). You will be using elemental spells (Fire, Bolt, Ice) for Demons Gate as it is immune to Poison.<br>- Getting all of the Time materia is a costly proposition at 6000 gil per materia. That separate save is made primarily for this, so that you can revert back before spending a bunch of money. If you need to raise funds though, this is another opportunity to unlock more limit breaks on your party and raise levels.<br><br>The general strategy is to use Bio to cause the poison status on any battles you come across (running from battles is not allowed) and then defend until the enemy dies. Use Select+R1 to see the health of the enemies if you need to know how long it'll take for them to die. Never use items at all. Be slow and methodical, intentional in all your actions. Good luck!<br><br><details>The challenge starts upon entering the maze, after using the Keystone. If you see the indicator that the achievement is primed, you'll know that you are properly equipped for the challenge. Set up your party outside the temple, save the game in a separate slot, and reset. After restarting, enter the temple and the maze, ensuring the achievement indicator is active. I used this map for navigating the maze as efficiently as possible to minimize encounters: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/map/6880-temple-of-the-ancients-map. Get into a groove as you fight to poison an enemy with Bio, then defend every time, perhaps using fast forward to speed up ATB between inputs. Just use caution to not mash and accidentally use attack (or with cursor memory, ensure the Magic command is highlighted before selecting Defend).<br><br>Here is a room-by-room breakdown:<br>- **Maze room**: With the reset prior to starting the challenge and efficient movement through the maze, I only had one encounter with a Doorbull. That battle was in or near the archway with the Turbo Ether that's in the middle of the path.<br>- **Boulder room**: Move through the boulder gaps to avoid getting crushed then skip through the cutscene and head back from the pool to the staircase. There are no encounters in this room. Don't talk to the NPC here to rest or save.<br>- **Clock room**: Go through Door V to get the Ribbon. Don't let the second hand knock you off. Head back and take Door VI. Some people also like to grab the Princess Guard from Door IIII but I think the Fairy Tale is more than enough. Again, there are no encounters in this room (and you shouldn't get one while getting the Ribbon if movement was efficient).<br>- **Door maze**: Go to the left along the ledge near where the person went into the door and press Circle to jump down, then enter the third door from the left. The door at the top will unlock. Head back to the left and jump down the ledge again and enter the rightmost door to go back to the top. Yet again, there are no encounters here. **DON'T SAVE** because you have to do this in one session.<br>- **Mural room/Red Dragon fight**: The fiend has 6800 HP. Cast Bio to get it poisoned so it takes 212 HP per poison tick and then defend until it dies. Use Cure to heal as necessary. It'll take about 30-ish poison ticks for it to die. The red dragon breath is probably the most dangerous attack. Heal up after the fight with Cure magic before proceeding.<br>- **Leaving the temple**: After learning what the Black Materia actually is, leave the mural room. You can have an encounter here with 2 Ancient Dragons if you skipped picking up the Ribbon. I had no other encounters through the door room and clock room.<br>- **Demons Gate fight**: While Sadness is in effect, a character receives less than 500 HP from a rock falling on them, less than 400 HP from Demon Rush, and less than 300 HP from Cave-In. Add 200 HP damage to each of those attacks when no longer afflicted with Sadness. Use this to help you determine when to cast Cure on your characters. These values are based on my characters' stats at the time so your mileage may vary. Make good use of the ATB waiting by queuing in a character's action, and then going into the next character's Magic menu to stop the ATB until the previous character takes their action. This will give you the opportunity to determine if you need to heal or can attack if Demons Gate doesn't attack. Sometimes, Demons Gate will drop two rocks on the same turn. If it hits the same character, have any character heal the affected party member immediately. Attack with elemental magics (Fire/Ice/Bolt).<br><br>This challenge was incredibly intense and highly satisfying when I was able to succeed. Having to pay careful attention to turn order, health, MP, and careful input made it exciting, despite having to run back a few times due to mistakes I made from carelessness.<br>Here is the character build that I used when I succeeded:<br>**Cloud: Level 46**<br>- HP 1801; MP 584 (I had 108 at the end)<br>- Murasame (Fire, Poison, Restore, Gravity, Earth)<br>- Edincoat (Time x7)<br>- Sprint Shoes (free Haste)<br>**Aerith: Level 40**<br>- HP 1402; MP 501 (I had 60-ish at the end)<br>- Fairy Tale (Ice, Fire, Restore, Revive, Time x3)<br>- Gold Armlet (Time x4)<br>- White Cape; swapped to Ribbon (Ribbon for petrify protection)<br>**Cid: Level 42**<br>- HP 1368; MP 475 (I had 20-ish at the end)<br>- Dragoon Lance (Lightning, Barrier, Restore, Destruct, Heal, Time x3)<br>- Gold Armlet (Time x4)<br>- Jem Ring (Petrify protection)</details> |

Not only do we have to deal with the extreme cold without a coat, but also this smelly plant without plugging our noses?! Hopefully we'll get knocked to our senses after the stench hits and then we can fully recover and uproot this awful plant.<br><br><details>This is easier said than done since everyone will be confused and asleep (on top of the other effects) and must wait for them to get knocked off of a character randomly. To then do any damage, you'll need to get rid of Frog status as well. If you happened to have some Remedies on hand, now is a great time to use them! So, while wandering around outside areas in Gaea's Cliff, ensure that you keep your health topped up between encounters. Also, make sure you have no status resistances. This can be done by going to the Status screen in the menu, and pressing Circle twice. If you have any statuses in the Defend area that are written in white letters, you need to remove the associated accessory or materia that gives that resistance to you. You'll know you are successful if it uses Bad Breath and the primed indicator for the achievement appears. Of course, Bad Breath is ALSO an enemy skill, so ensure that at least your main Enemy Skill materia is equipped for **Strago's Tribute**. The chance of Malboro appearing increases as you proceed further up the cliff so it may not be right away. I recommend just trying to get an encounter with a Malboro in the first area, before proceeding too far up the cliff, so that you can take advantage of Holzoff's House. Malboros are pretty much guaranteed in the second cave with the icicles when going on the paths outside if you need another spot to try for this. The final location is at Northern Crater if you aren't able to succeed at Gaea's Cliff.</details>

A little bit of razzle-dazzle.<br><br><details>In preparation for this achievement, it may be a good idea to get a few Dazers from the Boundfat (recolored Hedgehog Pie) enemies in the area outside of Bone Village and the Corral Valley area. Dazers will paralyze Jenova DEATH and reduce the number of turns they can take to help make the challenge easier. They aren't necessary though if prepared in other ways. Unfortunately, the save crystal is a few screens back so there is a bit of a run back if your challenge attempt fails. If you got Dazers, use them to paralyze Jenova to reduce the number of turns she has. It may be a good idea to get limit breaks built up on all characters as well prior to the fight. Cloud's Meteorain or Omnislash and Tifa's reels can deal out a lot of the 25000 HP that you need to whittle down. I only needed one Dazers and all three characters to do their limit breaks to defeat the boss and get the achievement. The slot reel exploit is beneficial for Tifa's limit break and both limit breaks I mentioned for Cloud should be more than enough to take her out. There is a primed achievement indicator so if the battle does go too long and it disappears, then you'll know to reset and adjust your strategy for the next attempt. If you didn't get any Dazers and want to use them, you can still backtrack to the Boundfats, which is opportunity to gain more levels and limit breaks as well.</details>

You were tough! I never seen such finger speed before.<br><br><details>Mashing Circle was enough to "win" the slap fight. The win condition for this seems to be hitting Scarlet more than she can hit you until she says "God! I can't stand it!" and then her telling the guards to "Take her away." I got in 5 hits to her 2 hits on Tifa. It's a long way back if you lose so if you don't get it on the first run, perhaps try again during **David and Goliath** if you don't want to go through all of the scenes again. I did another attempt using auto-fire of the Circle button at a 1 frame interval and I got hit by Scarlet 3 times but I still managed to win with 5.</details>

We have to catch them and stop that train! I'm sure this Enemy Skill materia has more than enough punch to get through the guards quickly.<br><br><details>Head toward the Corel Reactor from North Corel (there is a save crystal on the tracks a couple screens from the reactor). After reaching the Corel reactor, a train departs with the Huge Materia that you have to board and stop before it collides with North Corel. 10 minutes are on the clock and we have to stop it before it hits 4:00 to get **Crazy Train**. Catch up to the train by alternating pressing Up and Triangle in a rhythm (don't mash). You can reach the Huge Materia train in about 10 seconds with efficiently quick inputs. There are five cars total, each with an encounter. Use quick inputs and strong spells to wrap up the fights as fast as possible. Do NOT use summons! Trine and Bolt3 are great for the first two fights and especially the fourth on the Eagle Gun. Aqualung is good on the third fight against Wolfmeister. Finally, the fifth car has a single Attack Squad and then you can stop the train. Mash through the results screens after battles and don't worry about healing. Just go go go! I got to the train engine at around 6:40-ish left on the clock and then the humorous attempt to stop the train took another 30 seconds or so.</details>

|        ![Tifa exploding things with her fist](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/87585.png "How Many Heavens Are There?")        | [How Many Heavens Are There?](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81636)    | There's seven heavens. Everyone knows this, Yeah! Just don't peek and the slots will stop.<br><br><details>A challenge to get all Yeah! icons on Tifa's limit break slots is available after getting the Final Heaven limit break. The comments on the achievement provide a bunch of guidance on how people have earned this and ideal ways to set up for multiple attempts. RA user [rlxldk](https://retroachievements.org/user/rlxldk) provided an excellent method to farm attempts if you are having trouble:<br>- Go to Cactus Island and put the whole team in the back row. Manipulate a Cactuer and put Resist on it (this prevents it from losing manipulate status), then Mini and Fury Tifa. Force the Cactuer to use 1000 Needles on Tifa to build the limit gauge and then try to get Yeah! on all spots of the slots. If you don't, repeat the process. The Cactuer won't die and you can keep healing Tifa.<br>The slot exploit (using the square button to hide and pause the slots rolling) could work for you, though I have found it tough to determine where the Yeah! might be with this method. Pausing the emulator though is a valid option (Spacebar is the default on DuckStation). As RA user [Xeishiki](https://retroachievements.org/user/Xeishiki) states, using the emulator pause will enable you to still see the slot reel so that you can better time the button press. Getting the Yeah! at a position of 1 to 1-1/2 spots above the center should enable you to hold the Circle button and unpausing the emulator to land the Yeah! Take care not to mash because then that would cause later slots to stop as well. Emulator pausing can be a bit of a pain because hardcore mode mandates a delay in-between pauses so timing the pause will get difficult on the later reels. But, it's probably still much easier than just having to attempt rebuilding limit over and over again.<br>It is really funny to watch a tiny Tifa piledrive a cactus!</details>

It's a good thing my super-fast chocobo is in the lower ranks.<br><br><details>Take your Gold Chocobo on the long course, switch to manual mode, and hold both R shoulder buttons the whole time. You'll cross the finish line with full stamina and this achievement. This is probably easier to do while the Gold is in the lower ranks. If not, you may need to breed a new gold chocobo and max its stats to get back into the lower ranks again and try for this achievement.</details>

The catwalk over the submarines is a good spot as there are some strong-ish enemies that can take out the party, along with your own party members attacking each other. There is a save point just past the catwalk that you can then use to prepare and save your game. Another spot to knock out party members is the forced encounters prior to Carry Armor, after the save point. No matter what you decide, prepare your solo character with Knights of the Round. Unleash the knights upon Carry Armor and win. The Carry Armor may get a couple of attacks off prior to being able to press the win button, so make sure you have the HP and defense to handle those initial attacks.</details>

We'll need to turn the odds in our favor somehow. Frame perfect inputs are easier with the proper tools...<br><br><details>Once you have Slots unlocked, you can get the Game Over technique and this achievement. These reels are faster than all others in the game so it can be very tough to read, even when trying to use the slots exploit or emulator pausing. Even worse, the game has a 99% chance to roll over the reel past the spot that would trigger Game Over if you attempt to land it legitimately. To get around this, making use of auto-fire or mashing Circle will force the game to stop the reel in the correct spot.

We have to get to the Northern Crater. Let's get ready for the final battle prior to boarding the Highwind.<br><br><details>As the hint implies, pick your party and fill up their limit break gauges prior to getting onto the Highwind. Ideally, pick characters that will do multiple hits with a limit break, or include Vincent. It's better to do this before Diamond Weapon begins its march on Midgar because, while there are encounters during the march, it's not an ideal time to build limit gauge and encounters in the Midgar area won't build it up very much at this point. If you are concerned that the party won't take out Diamond Weapon with three attacks, keep Fury status on them (though Vincent shouldn't need it once transformed). Also, if you have Counter materia equipped, remove it! A counter attack will nullify the achievement attempt. Once the battle begins, unleash the limits and win! If your limits don't take out the 30k HP, wait for characters to charge up limit gauge again without taking any actions at all and hope that they don't die before being able to unleash another limit break. I used Cloud's Meteorain, Cid's Dragon Dive, and Yuffie's All Creation to take it out in one round (though I did get a little bit lucky with crits). Any Vincent limit, Cloud's Omnislash (if you have it by now), and other multi-hit limit breaks will work great too. If you have trouble, revert to an earlier save and try a different combination. If you want to get Rising Sun, you'll need to do the battle again since you can't steal during this challenge.<br>After I wrote these notes, it seems that you actually have plenty of time to prepare for Diamond Weapon, since it stops just before Midgar, according to some sources on the Internet. I haven't personally verified that it possible though, so it I'm keeping my original preparation notes here for now.</details>

This "ultimate" weapon just keeps running away! Time to pull out the big guns.<br><br><details>You can fight the second battle against Ultimate Weapon just before the raid on Midgar. The achievement description says "first phase" despite having fought Ultimate Weapon once before in Mideel. What the description is referring to is this point where you now can chase Ultimate Weapon around the world and knocking down it's HP pool to 20k or less before it runs away to the final battle location outside Cosmo Canyon. Ultimate Weapon is first found at a newly formed crater near Junon. Even taking it all the way to 0 HP will cause it to run away to it's final battle location. If you did more than 20k HP damage during the first battle at Mideel, that damage carries over into this fight, so you'll have less work to do on this battle. You only have a few rounds to work with. So what attack do you have that will do a ton of damage in a single attack? That's right! Knights of the Round! I put Knights of the Round, Bahamut ZERO, and Neo Bahamut on separate characters and cued all three summons up at once. Bahamut ZERO went first, doing around 7.5k HP damage. Knights of the Round followed, doing 5.5k HP damage 13 times for a total of about 71.5k HP of damage to Ultimate Weapon. I would have been fine with just Knights of the Round, given that I did about 31.5k HP damage in the Mideel fight. But, it didn't hurt to have the other big damage dealers ready to go, just in case.</details>

Time to pull out the big guns... again...<br><br><details>This is a challenge achievement and missable because if any one of the Turks is killed, the other two will run right away. So you need to take them all out in one shot, hence the achievement name. If you did the Wutai side quest, you can also completely skip this battle by saying "No, let's not go" (second option) which would skip the achievement as well. So make sure to do the fight! Besides, you'll want to steal at least the Minerva Band from Elena, but the other two have the same steals from earlier battles and are just as good to get. The obvious play is Knights of the Round. I forgot to equip the summon prior to the fight and was trying to Aqualung to take them all out. Unfortunately, the damage wasn't enough because Reno's lower HP resulted in the battle ending when he died before the other two could be taken down. You could try to reduce Elena's and Rude's HP to near Reno's, but that's tricky unless you are manually adding up the damage. Just press the win button with Knights of the Round.</details>

|                       ![Vincent as Chaos](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/211265.png "Sweet Vengeance")                       | [Sweet Vengeance](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81653)                | Vincent tells the team that he's going to take care of Hojo alone. He dons his most powerful, evasive, and immunity-inducing equipment, _kills off his friends???_, and fills his limit gauge in order to show Hojo his true strength.<br><br><details>Ensure Vincent's limit gauge is full and kill off the other two party members in random encounters. Equip the Mystile armor for it's high evasion, the Death Penalty for it's attack power, and a Ribbon to avoid negative status effects (Chaos is only immune to Berserk, Frog, and Confusion without the Ribbon). Place Vincent in the back row as well to reduce damage when attacks actually land. My Vincent was level 60 with 6224 HP and the above equipment and I survived with only 228 HP by the end of the fight! It was close (I forgot to put Vincent in the back row). Some people reported having any materia aside from Independent materia causes problems. Use the save crystal at the bottom of the ladder to make sure you can try again if the achievement fails. That wasn't an issue for me (I kept all of the the same materia on that Vincent had during the entire raid of Midgar) and the achievement unlocked, so maybe the issues around materia have been fixed.</details>

|                ![Emerald Weapon firing a pink laser](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/527016.png "Ocean Power")                | [Ocean Power](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/464319)                   | A lot of people seemed to want to use source farming tricks to maximize stats. That would certainly make things easy, but I decided to just use the natural stat growth from leveling up as well as materia to do this fight. Remember to not use any ultimate weapons, equip any countering or absorb type materia, or use the Knights of the Round summon. Also make sure to not equip Underwater, Mime, or Final Attack materia. If you have a max HP of 9999, make sure to not have only 2 materia equipped or you could hit Lucky 7s, which will invalidate the achievement. Finally, if you are using Cait Sith for the fight, do not try to get Game Over. You'll know you successfully met the requirements if the achievement primed indicator appears at the start of the battle.<br>See the spoiler dropdown for full details if you need help on the setup.<br><br><details>I put my team into Fury status so that Limit Breaks were frequent and usually queued up when Emerald Weapon's eyes activated. Since my stats are lower because of not farming sources, I made use of Hero Drinks to boost stats during the fight. W-Item is great for getting two Hero Drinks in a round. Four per character should be enough.<br>I opened with Hades to slow down Emerald Weapon while the other two W-Item'd Hero Drinks. When they hit four drinks, they helped the other character without W-Item drink up Hero Drinks as well. One character with Master Magic and Quadra Magic junctioned to it would quad cast Demi on Emerald Weapon while the other two used 4x Cut. Quad Demi casts are nice because they will do 9999 HP of damage each until Emerald Weapon is nearly defeated so it is a nice indication that you are close to winning the battle. If possible, limits were reserved for when the eyes activated so that they could be destroyed as soon as possible and avoid Aire Tam Storm. Megalixir and Elixir are the primary healing source. Be cautious and responsive to Emerald Weapon's attack script shifts while keeping health up and being aggressive to win. Also, if you have Master Command materia and the eyes open while no limits are ready, throwing gil is very effective at hitting everything for max damage. It won't be enough to take the eyes out, but it'll help speed up the process as a backup.

|                           ![Ruby Weapon](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/527062.png "Desert Storm")                           | [Desert Storm](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/464320)                  | Wow. This was much more difficult to figure out than Emerald Weapon. Ruby Weapon has very high stats which make hitting the thing difficult. It uses tentacles to surround you into a pincer attack. The tentacles use percentage based attacks to your HP and MP (that also cause status effects if you don't have a Ribbon) while Ruby Weapon itself uses magic based attacks, including Ultima and Shadow Flare. If you have more than one party member alive, Ruby Weapon will put the tentacles away (or not put them in the sand if you start with more than one character alive) and then basically eject a character at random until only one character remains. So it is ideal to only have one person alive at the start of the battle. Because of it's high stats, you may find that hits can be difficult to land, especially if under Fury status. Of course, none of this would be an issue really if you max your stats with source farming. That's no fun though. Let's continue using our party at max level with their given stats and materia to solve this problem.<br>See the spoiler dropdown for full details if you need help on the setup and fight.<details>I found Barret to be the ideal person to take on this battle. His ultimate weapon (we can use them for this challenge) deals more damage based on the AP earned by the materia attached to it. That means attaching Knights of the Round or Master Summon materia will greatly improve the damage output of the weapon. As stated earlier, Ribbon is a must because of the tentacles. Ziedrich is ideal armor because it reduces elemental damage and has a high evasion rate without materia slots. So we have eight slots to work with and want the maximum AP materia we can attach to it. Again, Knights of the Round or Master Summon should be attached (as long as we don't use the summon or Hades, the challenge remains active). The next highest AP is Magic Counter, however we can't use it because that materia is banned for the challenge. Following that is the W-Item, W-Magic, and W-Summon materia for next highest AP. W-Item is an excellent command to have anyway to quickly get Hero Drinks up AND recover from Ruby Weapon's attacks. Now for functional materia, we'll want mastered Double Cut to attack four times per round and Enemy Skill with Magic Hammer and Big Guard. For the last two slots, I put Luck and Speed Plus materia in to improve those stats for increased critical hit rate and improve the chance to land hits. When using items, make sure to NOT use Dazers or the challenge will be invalidated.<br>For the actual fight, start off the first two rounds with Hero Drinks x2. Next, cast Big Guard. Now you have to maintain a delicate balance of keeping the barriers up, using Magic Hammer to reduce Ruby Weapon's MP pool, and keeping your health up. If you get down below 4000 HP, you urgently need to heal as Ultima and Shadow Flare will do around nearly that much damage WHILE the barriers are up! They do MUCH more without having the barriers. The idea here is to survive long enough while helping Ruby Weapon burn their MP pool to start seeing the message "Ruby Weapon's skill power is used up". At this point, Ruby Weapon's enemy skills will only do around 800-1800 HP of damage. Still be attentive to barriers and your health, since the tentacles can take a lot of your health away. Now is the time to begin fighting back. Use limits (deals about 1600 HP damage x10 plus more with critical hits) and 4x Cut (about 9000 HP per hit or 9999 HP if a critical hit). Some of your 4x Cut attacks can miss, especially if you use Fury to try to get more limits. I noticed that I was missing a lot of attacks though, so I tried to use a Tranquilizer during the battle. My hit rate seemed to improve, but I was still in Fury status and couldn't get out of it. I don't know if that was a bug with the game or what but it did seem that I had the benefit of improved hit rate while also increasing limit gauge quickly.<br>This is a long, taxing fight. You have to be paying attention closely, especially in the first half while Ruby Weapon can cast spells. Take your time, rest and think if you need to while in the Item or Magic menu, and you'll come out victorious in the end while not having used sources to max stats. Good luck!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

These will also impact Bizzaro Sephiroth though I assume that we are largely concerned with Safer for this particular achievement. To avoid targeting the head of Bizzaro Sephiroth, multi-target spells, skills, and commands cannot be used. Do not get Game Over of Cait Sith's Slots limit break! There is no primed achievement notification for this either so you won't know you've done it right until the final hit.<br>- **Jenova Synthesis**: This should be the only use of Knights of the Round allowed toward this achievement. Using it at all on either form of Sephiroth following this fight will invalidate the achievement. Not much else to this fight.<br>- **Bizzaro Sephiroth**: You will be split into three teams. You'll have the opportunity here to set up each team's equipment and second check the materia. The party members with Cloud will move on to Safer Sephiroth so keep that in mind (make sure everyone can Long Range!). You will start with Cloud's party. Take out an arm part. Switch teams then take out another arm part. Switch yet again and take out yet another arm. Switch back to the Cloud and destroy the core and body. Honestly, the hardest part of this fight is targeting the part you want to destroy! The pattern to go with on the sides is to hit the upper and lower arm parts (D and E), then take out part C. Switch at this point to the other side and repeat this pattern. Switch again and you'll be back with Cloud. Take out the Core (part C), then take out the body (part A) to win this phase of the battle. Some have stated in this achievement's comments that they attacked the head and didn't face issue with this achievement but I didn't risk it.<br>- **Safer Sephiroth**: With all of the materia and levels, this should be a cakewalk. Use your items to heal and focus on the physical damage.

This requires planning ahead and deep knowledge of the game to succeed. Personally, I found this challenge to be a lot of fun to plan out and being able to win the final battle with this restriction was the most challenging thing I've ever done in this game. It was very satisfying and I hope to help you get that same feeling with the spreadsheet that I created to help with the planning aspect. [A whole section of the guide](#david-and-goliath-low-level-challenge) has been set up for just this challenge.

**NOTE**: Some people have reported issues with achievements associated with unlocking final limit breaks. I never personally experienced these issues but to be safe I made a save just prior to using the limit break manual, just in case. More than likely the issues were experienced prior to the revisions and this problem isn't a worry any more, but I want to bring attention to it here that others have had a pain point with them.

Once found, perhaps you shouldn't let on that you want them on your team.<br><br><details>Yuffie can be found in the forest regions on the world map. This means that the earliest spot to recruit her is after leaving the Mythril Mine, reaching the Junon area. She'll appear in a random battle as "Mystery Ninja". Defeat her and you'll appear in a scene where she is knocked down on the ground and a save crystal nearby. Don't go into your menu and do not use the save crystal or she'll steal gil and run off. Speak to her instead and respond to her questions with the following options: "Not interested", "......petrified", "Wait a second!", "......that's right", and "Let's hurry on". Adding her to the team early is ideal for the normal run so fights in the forests around Junon is a good idea. However, the Formula bird enemies can be pretty ruthless in the early game so you may want to wait if you are having issues. With being able to save on the overworld though, you should just set up a save, grind in the forests, and if health gets too low, just reload your save and try again.</details> |

This can be manipulated to happen as well though. You can easily get it during the Emerald Weapon fight when a character has 9999 HP and two materia equipped (this nullifies the **Ocean Power** achievement however). Another way to manipulate it is to have a character with HP very close to 7777, fight a battle where monsters can be put to sleep or they do very minimal damage, shrink another party member with Mini, and chip a character down 1 HP at a time to 7777. This may be obvious, but if you are going to Mini someone, ensure they don't have protection against it, or it won't work.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Treasure

**NOTE**: Nearly all of these achievements are missable! Be alert as you enter new regions and watch the counter accumulate to ensure that you get all the items. Also, some of these achievements require multiple visits to be able to access some of the items. In order to ensure that you can get the achievements in those later visits, I split up the applicable achievements and specify the number of items you should have in each portion. The location hints then break down the areas that the items can be found in and how many items are in those areas. Finally, open the spoiler to see exactly where each item is and what it is if you want the full answer.

This will put you into arguably the most efficient location for getting all of the treasure of the area. Because of the nature of this area, you will probably pass out at least once while trying to get all of the treasure. When you do pass out, you'll end up at the red checkmark location (Holzoff's House) where you have an opportunity to save your game and rest. You can then proceed down into the windy snowfield and resume gathering the remaining treasures. There are seven items in total. Here is a good map, as recommended by a couple of people on this achievement's comments: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/map/6673-great-glacier-map. Rather than describe how to get each item, I'll just list them in the order that I picked them up, but feel free to use the map and find your own way through to get each item.<br>1. Mind Source (in a bag in the forest)<br>2. Potion (on ice in the water)<br>3. Safety Bit (in a cave on the lake after jumping on ice floes)<br>4. Added Cut materia (on an angled path between a four way fork and the hot springs; hard to see on the ground midway on the screen just before the hot spring screen)<br>5. All materia (in the windy snow field in a cave in the middle of the map)<br>6. "Boss" fight with Snow and get the Alexander materia (Touch the hot spring, then proceed to the windy snowfield and head east to another cave containing the materia; I passed out JUST before entering the cave. Thankfully, you don't have to touch the hot spring again so you can just head back to here if you pass out before hand.)<br>7. Elixir (in a cave west of the windy snowfield; you can get infinite Elixirs because the game doesn't force you to close the text box to move, but you must eventually pick it up to get credit for finding the item and getting the achievement)</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Cross the bridge and walk straight into the wall to find a hidden room with a **Ribbon** in a chest.<br>- Item 22: Heading a little farther north is another chest with a **Javelin** weapon.<br>- Item 23: After another climb and in the next cave, head right immediately to pick up an **Elixir** in a chest.<br>-Item 24: Take the upper right door, loop around outside, and enter the cave again to find a chest with a **Fire Armlet**.<br>- Item 25: Fight through the icicles (don't jump down!) to get to a chest on the other side with a **Megalixir** (labeled as "Last Elixir" in this case).<br>- Item 26: Head back either by jumping down or taking the outside path then climb up the icicle to the chest in the upper left with a **Speed Source**.<br>- Item 27: Take the center door and open the chest with the **Enhance Sword** weapon.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This is a one-time only location so make sure you have all four prior to leaving!<br><br><details>- Item 1: After having Tifa forced onto the team, you'll see a robed man fall off a cliff. Shortly after that is the **Neo Bahamut materia** on the ground, partially obscured by a rock, just before a save crystal.<br>- Item 2: Two more robed men get buffeted by the wind. Talking to them drops an Ether and Hi-Potion, but they don't count toward the achievement.

Also, while in town, do not proceed too far in (where the dog is in the middle of town). Go into a shop and talk to the person running around and their Chocobo. Give it the Mimett Green (the game refers to it as Samolen) and tickle it behind the ears to get a **Contain materia**.<br>- Item 25: In the Mideel weapon shop, examine the locked door in the back.

Any items missed as you proceed will be lost forever once you finish the area. Items are found inside the plate (6 items), along the train tunnel tracks (5 items), during a revisit to Shinra Headquarters (6 items), and along the path to the Sister Ray (3 items). The final item requires a specific character to be in the party before opening the chest. Without them there, the chest will be empty. Thankfully, there is a save crystal nearby it.<br><br><details>Inside the plate<br>- Items 13 and 14: Once inside the plate, take the center path to chests with an **Elixir** and **Megalixir**<br>- Item 15: Head down stairs back at the start of the area and down a ladder. At the bottom, DO NOT GO RIGHT! Go left and up another long ladder to a chest with an **Aegis Armlet**.<br>- Items 16 and 17: Head back down the ladder and go to the right this time which forces you down to a lower level, making the previous section inaccessible. Follow the path to an air duct that takes you to two chests with the **Starlight Phone** weapon and an **Elixir**.<br>- Item 18: Go down the ladder near the Elixir chest, moving near a duct with "42" on the side and press Circle to jump down to it. Enter the duct and take a ladder up to a chest with the **Max Ray** weapon.<br><br>Train tunnels<br>- Item 19: Head south as soon as you enter the tunnels. You'll see red numbers on the wall at the track junction rooms. At Junction 3, you'll finally find the first chest with a **Power Source**.<br>- Item 20: Continue down to Junction 2 that has a chest with a **Guard Source**<br>- Items 21 and 22: Two chests in Junction 1 have a **Mind Source** and **Magic Source**<br>- Item 23: **W-Item materia** waits for you at the end of the tunnel next to a save crystal<br><br>Shinra Headquarters<br>- Item 24: An item bag with a **Behemoth Horn** weapon sits in the stair well (it's a bit hard to see, as I definitely walked passed it before!)<br>- Item 25: On the 63rd floor, in one of the rooms with the coupons, is a new item bag containing the **Grow Lance** weapon<br>- Item 26: BANG on the vending machine on the 64th floor one more time and you'll get a **Mind Source and Speed Source** (counts for one toward the achievement)<br>- Item 27: Open the locker with the megaphone to get Cait Sith's ultimate weapon, **HP Shout**<br>- Items 28 and 29: Head back to the shop on the 2nd floor and open the two chests in there that hold the **Pile Bunker** and **Master Fist** weapons<br><br>Path to Sister Ray<br>- Items 30 and 31: After the fight with Proud Clod are two chests with an **Elixir** and **Mystile** armor<br>- Item 32: With Barret in your party, open the final chest on the stairs up to Sister Ray to get his ultimate weapon, **Missing Score**</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Take care to ensure that you don't try to grab the chest before a rock falls as you head toward the chest. This can result in a bug that prevents the text box saying that you got the Save Crystal item from closing, which prevents it from going into your inventory and thus preventing getting this achievement. If this happens, reload a save and slow down.<br>- Item 6: Continue down the spiraling descent to reach another chest that contains a **Guard Source**.<br>- Items 7 and 8: On the second screen, there are two paths heading downward and items on both sides. Make sure to grab the chest with a **Power Source** and a **HP Absorb materia** on the left ledge near the top.<br>- Items 9 through 12: Afterword, check the remaining chests on the screen containing an **Elixir**, **Guard Source**, **Mind Source** and **Magic Source**.<br>- Item 13: The third screen of the descent can be confusing to navigate with hidden holes and a network of caves. Jump down and then head right to fall down a hole and open a chest for a **Mind Source**.<br>- Item 14: Walk back right and jump up to the ledge above, cross over and jump down, entering the cave and getting a **Megalixir** in a chest.<br>- Item 15: Leave the cave and go left, falling down several levels to a chest with a **Hero Drink**.<br>- Item 16: Enter the cave and open the chest with a **Guard Source**.<br>- Item 17: Follow the path upward to a hole along the right side that leads to a chest with a **Power Source**.<br><br>Continuing on splits the party into three paths, and the route you interact with is where you send Cloud.<br><br>Rocky (Left-Down) path<br>- Item 18: A chest is just near the start with a **Remedy**.<br>- Item 19: Head right and jump across the stones to another chest with an **Elixir**.<br>- Item 20: Head back to the previous chest and head down to open a chest with an **X-Potion**.<br>- Item 21: On the next screen, head down and jump down the center to a chest with a **Turbo Ether**.<br>- Item 22: Follow the path right to a chest with a **Vaccine**.<br>- Item 23: Head to the left and look closely at an area where the Lifestream is brightest on the left edge of the screen to see a **Magic Counter materia** floating within.<br>- Item 24: Next screen on, a chest is nearby with an **X-Potion**.<br>- Item 25: Continue downward to another chest with a **Turbo Ether**.<br>- Item 26: To the left is a **Mega All materia** in the Lifestream.<br>- Item 27: Keep moving left to a chest with a **Speed Source**.<br>Exit at the bottom left to the Bottom of the Crater. Now, head back up the way we came to where we first split up with the party and go down the Right path, the Graveyard.<br><br>Graveyard (Right) path<br>- Items 28 and 29: At the bottom of the spiral, drop down and pick up the **Mystile** in a chest and **Elixir**.<br>- Item 30: Head farther down to the next screen (you can see the upcoming chest on the previous screen) and open the chest to get a **Speed Source**.<br>- Item 31: Head down between the two "shells" to find a chest with a **Tetra Elemental** accessory.<br>- Items 32 and 33: A path to the left has a chest with a **Megalixir** and a chest straight ahead to the exit of this screen has another **Megalixir**.<br>Reaching the bottom of the crater, return to the Rocky path and make your way back up again, this time to where the party split a second time to the Upper-Left path, the Swamp.<br><br>Swamp (Upper-Left) path<br>- Item 34: Take the lower path from the start around to a chest with a **Magic Source**.<br>- Item 35: Return to the start and take the upper path, swim through the swamp and grab the **Remedy** in the chest before leaving to the next screen on the right.<br>- Item 36: On the new screen, go along the lower path to reach a chest with a **Hero Drink**.<br>- Item 37: Head left along the center path and then up and left to a chest in the back with a **Vaccine**.<br>- Item 38: Go back to the fork and take the right path to a green **Shield materia**.<br>- Item 39: Run straight down from the Shield materia to dive into the swamp and come out the water near a chest with an **Imperial Guard**.<br>- Item 40: Go back into the water to be taken near the exit of this screen. In this final screen, a **W-Magic materia** is partially obscured by the green "leaves" (I guess?) north of the shining spot.<br>- Item 41: Head down to that shining spot to get **Counter materia**. Leave to the left and you'll have returned to the Bottom of the Crater again.<br><br>Bottom of the Crater:<br>- Item 42: All the paths converged here and on this final visit, open the final chest to get a **Luck Source**.<br><br>Congrats! Also note that, based on how you distributed your party, you may have some duplicated items when talking to the other characters that converge here because of entering this location and then returning to the start to take the other paths. The items that the other characters give a based on the location and who they are.

Just above that is an NPC who appears to be urinating near the fence leading to the plate support pillar. Talk to/interrupt them and they will foreshadow the future while you look at the pillar and get the achievement. This is missable because after you leave Sector 7, this NPC will have moved and events will prevent this conversation from happening.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Free him and he'll tell you some stuff and the achievement will unlock as he runs off. This is missable because if you don't come here before the Wutai side quest, this event will be no longer available. A lot of people missed this one because the achievement is far down the list, after the Huge Materia quests. So, if you happen to have missed it, you could always get it during **David and Goliath** or if you have an old save like I did, go back and get it on your own.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It sounds bad to say, but you can easily manipulate Tifa's affinity while in the prison cell together in Shinra Headquarters. By speaking to her over and over, you gain 1 affinity point. You need over 50 points for this scene, so you can build up exactly that much quickly with fast forward or get even more to be safe in case other actions taken in the future reduce her affinity some.

However, are your hearts ready to make that leap?<br><br><details>Not only is Tifa's affinity able to be raised infinitely, Barret's is as well! To do so, you'll need to have Barret in your party when you enter Cosmo Canyon for the first time. When the party splits up, Barret will be in the room behind Tiger Lily's Weapon Shop. Save your game and then chat with Barret to discuss Avalanche. If you say "Go on" (first option), Barret gains +3 affinity. If you then say "Yeah, whatever..." (second option), you can leave the room and reenter to do the conversation over again. Repeat this, gaining +3 affinity each time, to quickly get Barret's affinity up high enough to go on the date with him. Again, this can be done either on the normal or **David and Goliath** playthrough. The achievement unlocks upon completion of the ride at Round Square.

Make a save prior to playing to going there, just in case things go wrong. You get a chance to practice before hand, which you can use to get a feel for the timing of the button presses. In order to hit the achievement's requirement of 20 squats in the time limit, you will need to not make a mistake. Just focus on Cloud's movements, press the next button in the sequence, and ignore everything else.<br>You should be able to hit the goal of 20 squats easily as long as you can maintain a good pace without error. I hit 20 squats exactly during my normal playthrough and believe that I could get to 21 with more efficient movement.

After defeating the Heavy Grunts on the 59th floor, you are forced to go up to the 60th floor. I didn't try to go back down the elevator afterword to see if I could save the game prior to this little minigame. If you make a mistake, I'm not sure if the room resets if you are able to leave or not since I was able to get through this on my first try without getting an encounter.<br>The first half is fairly simple since the guards pacing at the top are walking. The pair of guards on both sides follow a consistent pattern. Watch the pattern and leverage it to sneak past without being seen. The guards can only see when they are facing south. Once Cloud gets to the center, he signals to Barret and Tifa one at a time on when to run by. Press the Circle button at the moment the guards begin moving or when no guards are between the statues.<br>The second set of guards are running so the timing is tighter on when to signal. Just watch for them to start moving and press the button at the same time, being careful to not press the button too early.<br>If you miss it on the normal run, you'll have to succeed during **David and Goliath** anyway so there's a second opportunity if you'd rather not reset.

The puzzle isn't too terribly difficult but there are plenty of guides out there, including [this one](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/71240/storyline-minigames#mayor-dominos-password), to tell you exactly how to figure out the answer easily.<br>The correct way to play is to find the book that doesn't belong in each area of the library and the number on the book identifies the letter as part of the password. After completing the puzzle and providing the correct password, you'll get Keycard 65 (the third for **Executive VIP**), and the third item for **Shinra Inc** as well as this achievement for the first attempt. The Elemental materia from this succeeding in this achievement is also the first of three that will unlock the **The Possibility of Elemental Bliss** achievement.

This is the first minigame that will more than likely frustrate you as the march is a bit tricky to get right. You are told by the commander to enter the open spot in the formation in the back row by running behind the group. Instead, you should fall into formation in FRONT of the row that you will join. This puts you into position to be judged sooner so that you have more opportunity to raise the rating high enough.<br>Once in the formation, start a rhythmic tapping of the Circle button to salute the rifle. Some guides mention mashing the button, but that didn't really work for me. I needed to hit the Circle button a lot, but slowing down slightly did more to raise the rating than pushing it as fast as possible. Additionally, your walking speed is slightly faster than the parade formation. As you hold the left direction on the D-pad and tap the Circle button, watch the rating. If it isn't going up, you may be a little too far forward of the row. Let go of the left direction and then repress it to line yourself back up.<br>This may take a couple of tries to get the feel for the event and get the >50% rating. It took me five attempts in my normal playthrough. I got it first try in the low level run since I had a handle on the process.

Take advantage of the save to get a feel for how it works.<br>The drill leader will announce a button or direction to press and you time it with the other two troopers. Rufus' rating will increase based on timing but only in increments of 10 points. It seems like if you are close on the timing, you'll get 10 points. If you are off a little bit, you'll get less than 10 points (if your timing is off a bit two or three times in a row, you'll see the 10 points). The special finishing move earns 30 points if timed decently and the direction doesn't matter. However, you'll get no points if the timing is completely off, press the wrong button, or are facing the wrong direction (wrong facing overrides any button prompts that have good timing so realign yourself immediately).<br>The first place reward is a Force Stealer weapon at 100 points, which is not as great as the HP Plus materia you get for second place (60-90 points), in my opinion. After getting the Force Stealer and achievement, I reset and purposely got second place to get the materia instead since you can get Force Stealer not too much later on. If you want the materia and are approaching 100 points, just don't do anything. The points never seem to go down.

Bikes come out in waves, three bikes each. Orange bikes will head right toward the truck while red bikes will try to avoid you and pull you away from the truck so other bikes (orange or red) can attack the truck. Try to stay near the truck and only pull away when red bikes need to be aggressively removed to start a new wave. If possible, use the orange bikes to create a chain reaction that takes out others, especially the red bikes. Staying near the truck will get orange bikes in a position where they can possibly hit other bikes as they slide away when hit by you.<br>Overall, I don't think this is too tough to complete (I got 12,000 exactly on my first try), but I can see how some may have problems. Ultimately, be aggressive while protecting the truck as much as possible and you'll eventually get this. You can get this on your first visit to Gold Saucer.

Many guides mention memorization of where targets appear so that you know where to position the cursor ahead of time, and that advice is definitely sound. Set up a save point at the Ropeway Station (costs 5GP to use though) so that you can practice the minigame as much as you want for only the one 10GP cost and resetting after each attempt. Setting up turbo/auto-fire for this game is also recommended to give your hands a break with repeated attempts. I had seen guides state that you should use a lower rate of triggering the Circle button, but a one frame rapid fire did the trick for me. As much as I loathe the site, the Fandom FF7 wiki page for [Speed Square](https://antifandom.com/finalfantasy/wiki/Speed_Square) does give a list of all the qualifying targets and their point values. Key targets to look out for:<br>- The boulder near the end of the cactus/desert area: worth 200 points. About three-quarters of the way through the section, the upper wall of the canyon contains the boulder. Position the cursor on the right side, along the top of the wall and fire to eventually hit it. <br><br><details>![](https://i.imgur.com/AAWz1Pg.png)</details><br>- Water wheel of steamboat: variable points. The steamboat appears after the first submarine jumps out of the water. Target down low and begin firing at the wheel but don't follow after it to keep getting more points. It's counterintuitive but it works well.<br>- Balloons: 30 points each. There's a LOT of them, they pop with one shot, and they are grouped up to hit a bunch in one blast. You should be able to hit nearly all of them for a good helping of points.<br>- Boss UFO: 1000 points. You can't miss it since the roller coaster stops at it. Center your cursor and just rapidly tap Circle (or use turbo/auto-fire). The UFO will back off and can't be hit for a little bit but will return once more to take fire until it blows up. As long as you keep your cursor in the center or slightly right of center, you'll hit it when it returns and it will go down with a high rate of maximum power shots.<br>- Final spotlight: 200 points. As the roller coaster approaches the final turn, spotlights begin to turn upwards toward the sky. Move the cursor into the bottom right corner (I've seen people say bottom left as well, but I couldn't quite get the positioning there to hit it for some reason). Once you get in range of the spotlights, begin holding the Circle button (**not turbo/auto-fire** in this case!) and let your power drain. Hold it through the bend and eventually you'll destroy the spotlight and get the final points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

There are 20 battles (not including the Huge Materia fight) that either need direct involvement or donation of funds ahead of time in order to get this achievement. This means that without knowing exactly when Shinra will strike the fort ahead of time, it is very easy to miss a battle and thus the achievement. The rewards from directly participating in each battle get progressively better so I will discuss the points when you need to return to Fort Condor. Giving the guard in the shack 3000 gil ahead of each scheduled battle will ensure that a missed battle is covered (and will be required for a some of the 20 fights) but I wanted to ensure that I got all of the items from the battles. Here is when each battle becomes available, grouped by the region where events occur that trigger new battles:<br><br>Junon<br>- Battle 1: As soon as you leave Mythril Mine and enter the Junon area for the first time.<br>- Battle 2: **Immediately** after saving Priscilla and resting at the house that is offered, before speaking to her and getting the Shiva materia.<br>- Battle 3: After getting the Shiva materia from Priscilla.<br><br>Corel<br>- Battle 4: After release from Corel Prison and receiving the buggy. Cross the ocean via the cargo ship at Costa del Sol.<br><br>Cosmo<br>- Battle 5: **DO NOT MOVE THE BUGGY TOO CLOSE TO COSMO CANYON!** If the buggy gets too close, it breaks down and this battle will be missed unless you gave 3000 gil to cover this. To be safe, I drove up the path to the town and got out at the turn back that leads to the village entrance, walking the rest of the way in. Complete the events in Cosmo Canyon up to where you are asked to form a party to go into the Gi Cave, then take the buggy and return to Fort Condor for this battle.<br>- Battle 6: Completing the Cave of the Gi makes this battle available. The buggy will be repaired if it broke down so this battle isn't as troublesome as the last.<br><br>Rocket Town<br>- Battle 7: This battle has a very small window. It is available after seeing the Tiny Bronco and Shera telling you to speak to "The Captain". Instead of seeking out Cid, return to Fort Condor for this battle.<br>- Battle 8: After getting Tiny Bronco, this battle is available. Getting back to Fort Condor is much more convenient now!<br><br>Temple of the Ancients<br>- Battle 9: When you get and subsequently lose the Keystone and are able to leave Gold Saucer, this battle is available. Head to Fort Condor before the Temple of the Ancients.<br>- Battle 10: This one is available after the Temple of the Ancients and awakening in Gongaga.<br><br>Northern Continent<br>- Battle 11: Once the Sleeping Forest has been awakened with the Lunar Harp, this battle becomes available. Getting back to Fort Condor has become inconvenient again...<br>- Battle 12: In the Forgotten City, take a nap. Inconveniently, rather than reuniting with Aerith, it's time to fight at Fort Condor once more.<br>- Battle 13: After the tragic events, and a disc change, return to Fort Condor once more. At this point, you must **give the guard at the shack 15,000-18,000 gil!** We're going to be unavailable for the next five battles...<br><br>Cloud is Missing<br>- Battles 14-18: This is why we gave the guard at the shack the gil during the previous visit. These were missed during the events at the Whirlwind Maze and the week that Tifa was unconscious.<br>- Battle 19: This is the final battle that we can actively participate in, which is available once you are in control of the Highwind. You'll know that the previously missed battles were covered when the guard informs you about them and your achievement measurement increases appropriately. **Ensure the guard has at least 3000 gil!** The final battle is unavailable for the party to participate in and funds must be left to cover the cost.<br>- Battle 20: This battle occurs during the Mideel/Lifestream sequence.<br><br>The achievement unlocks when you return to Fort Condor one more time for the Huge Materia as long as all previous battles were covered.<br><br>**Battle Strategies**<br>The battles themselves aren't too difficult to manage. Make use of the save crystal in Fort Condor or on the world map just prior to each fight, just in case. You need to defeat the commander unit in the minigame, not in battle if the units reach the top, to get credit for the achievement. When you talk to the guard to start the minigame, they typically provide some general guidance about what to expect.<br>- Battles 1-3: The basic strategy is to place a group of fighter, defender, and shooter at each one of the three lanes at the middle of the battlefield (the lowest spot you can place units before the start of the battle). The first fight can forgo defenders if money is tight since no barbarian enemies show up in that one. Let the enemies come to you and then engage each unit as they get close. If a unit dies, replace it. Once the commander unit appears, rush it with all of your remaining units. These first three battles are designed to give you a chance to learn the controls and how the flow of the game works.<br>- Battles 4-6: By now, you have more than enough money that it is better to swap out fighters for attackers for their advantage against the enemy beast units. The guard also makes a recommendation to deploy Fire Catapults. The first battle of this group probably doesn't need them, but the remaining two might. I made use of them for all of my remaining battles. Deploy them right at the furthest point, one at each of the three lanes. When you set it, you can set the angle where it fires and see the impact zone. Line it up to cover the bottleneck of the lane so that all enemy units will get smashed by it. Accompany each catapult with your attacker/defender/shooter group. As enemies enter the blast zone of the catapult, send out your units to engage so that the enemies continue to get hit by the catapult while they fight you. Again, as your units die, pay to replace them as needed since pay-to-win is a legitimate strategy here.<br>- Battles 7-20: The guard's new advice is to add tri-stoners to your repertoire of defenses. For all of the remaining battles, I used the same strategy as before, and adding tri-stoners as well. With this new unit, you set the direction where the boulders roll and can see the distance they'll travel. The boulders go the same distance as the catapults so I set a tri-stoner next to each catapult. Tri-stoners will only hit ground units so the catapults are primarily for air defense against the wyverns though they do hit everything. At this point, I was comfortable enough with the battles to only deploy the fire catapults and tri-stoners prior to the start of the battle and then deploying the appropriate attacker/defender/shooter to a lane when observing which type of enemy was reaching a particular lane. Ultimately, all remaining battles just escalate the number of units to fight as well as the amount of units in each wave. You will have more than enough money at this point to handle each fight, especially if you have been grinding for limit breaks. |

You'll be getting the Lunar Harp for story purposes, but you can get some of those good treasure items as well. There are four to get in total (technically the last treasure for this achievement is a "normal" treasure): Buntline, Megalixir, Mop, and Key to Sector 5. The Key to Sector 5 is unavailable until Disc 2 after Cloud reunites with the party.

You'll blaze ahead and win. No sprinting required nor needing to try to block Joe and his bird. If you don't encounter Joe during the A rank races, you'll definitely see him in the S ranks while going for **Elite Jockey**. To max out stats, give your Gold Chocobo 30 Sylkis greens (as discussed in the various breeding guides).

I'm sure you'll even see Joe during some of these (he was in more than half of the races in my experience). You can do short course races for all of these. Make sure to take the Sneak Attack and Enemy Away materia if they are the gifts since this is the only place to get those. After ten races in a row, Ester/Esther will automatically give you the prize package and this achievement.

There are five missions to do and one achievement for each:<br>- Level 0: A recreation of the battle for the Huge Materia in the Gold Saucer arcade game though there are quite a bit more targets to shoot down this time, seven in total. It's not terribly complicated though and you shouldn't have issues. Remember that you can use the R1 button to bring up an overhead view to help pinpoint where targets are if none are nearby.<br>- Level 1: There are 10 targets this time and they are getting more evasive. Again, make use of R1 to find where targets are when none are around. 10 minutes is more than enough time.<br>- Level 2: Only eight targets but they are much faster. You'll need to get closer to them for your torpedoes to hit them as they'll outspeed your shots.<br>- Level 3: This one ups the difficulty a little by having 12 targets with many of them hiding down low between mountains. You'll need to search more. Additionally, as you begin to chase against enemy craft, they will move slowly so if you are going fast and you may actually pass them! If they aren't moving quickly, slow down yourself with with X button. I noticed that enemy subs were also taking more torpedoes to destroy them.<br>- Level 4: The final level of the submarine game has ten targets. About six yellow subs circle around a central mesa and the remaining red subs patrol around the outside areas. Be aggressive and you should win without problems.

You are graded on three metrics: Time, Technique, and Balloon. Time starts at 30 points and you lose 1 point for every 2 seconds slower than par time. Technique also starts at 30 points and you lose 1 point for bonking into anything that can stun you. Bonks that maintain speed and not knocking you down don't affect the score, seemingly. Finally, the balloons on the course give points based on their color: red is 1, blue is 3, and green is 5. There are 40 points possible in this category.<br><br>For each course, take a few trips down to learn the layout. Get a feel for the controls and try to remember where the turns and balloons are. The balloons are the most important thing. If you can take the time to get the majority of the red balloons and all blue and green balloons, even if you finish over the par time, you'll get over 90 points.<br>For this first course, the par time is 1:30. In the open portion with the sledding moogles, the balloons sort of guide you through the safe lanes, including between the trees, though I found that going at max speed can result in bumping into a moogle or two. It took me about 6 runs, split over an overnight rest from the game, to get the target points and the achievement. Patience, skill, and a little bit of luck with the annoying moogles at the end will pay off.

I managed to get down the slope on my winning run with 1:35, well ahead of the par time. I only had one bonk so Technique was 29 points. I managed to get most of the balloons, having 36 points. Aside from getting as many reds as you can, there is a blue balloon among some ice blocks after the "desert" section (it seems scary but is actually quite simple to get without bonking), and then there is a blue balloon when going down a fast and narrow slope with tall trees with a green balloon requiring a lot of speed to get the jump height needed to reach it at the end of the tree slope. Keep those three balloons in mind while taking time to brake slightly before sharp turns and you should have this in the bag. In my playthrough, I had ended up delaying this and the later course as a post game activity after giving it a few tries. When I went back to the game, I got this achievement on the second try. It turns out that I was going too slow in my initial attempts.

While the course has two achievements, it's best to just focus on going for the 90 point challenge, since the 70 point achievement will come naturally enough. One thing to note is once you complete this course the first time, a yellow balloon will now appear shortly after the starting point. Collecting that starts Time Attack mode which will remove all of the balloons on a course. If you pick it up on accident, just reset and try again as you focus on learning the C course and it's balloon layout.<br>Right at the beginning is a string of red balloons close together that lead to a big jump to a blue balloon. To get it, start on the outside of the slight turn and hook toward the red balloons. You'll want to be going at least 93 km/h or more when you jump to reach the blue balloon. If you missed the balloon because you didn't have enough height (something I had issues with), you are jumping too early.<br>Inside the icicle cavern, the icicles that drop are the same in every attempt so learn where they will appear in your path. The evil part is the larger open areas just before red balloons that drop a large ice boulder so give that wide berth. When you near the end of the cave, line up with the center of the opening and jump to catch the second blue balloon. You can't see it until just before getting outside of the cavern (I assume to simulate the idea of going back outside into sunlight and not being able to see initially).<br>Near the end of the course are moogles rolling back and forth on snowballs. The last blue balloon is between a pair of moogles (if you have enough speed, you can bonk them without getting knocked over or losing Technique). The green balloon is close to the end between another two moogles that are just ahead and behind the balloon.<br>In my winning run, I missed the last blue balloon and got all other high point balloons for 35 points, three bonks for 27 Technique points, and a time of 1:52 for 30 Time points after 8 attempts (not counting the multiple resets to learn how to jump for the first blue balloon). It seems daunting, but with enough runs in a row, you'll get this. Take your time going down the course and learning the lay of the land and you'll get this.

Rather than use the Ziedrich like I did when grinding for BP to purchase the Omnislash and W-Summon, I equipped the Mystile on Cloud so I could leverage more materia. I used Ultima Weapon and a Ribbon for the other equipment slots. For materia, I used 2 HP Plus materia that are mastered, Hades with Added Effect, Restore, Enemy Skill, Double Cut, and Long Range from the back row, MP Plus, Magic Plus, and Knights of the Round.<br>Obviously, there is a lot of differentiation between setups and handicaps so your mileage may vary with how successful things are with the challenge. In my playthrough, the trickiest part was Unknown 3 as it was doing a TON of physical attack damage and just after accidentally taking 1/2 HP on the reels. The rest of the battles weren't anything too tough. Of course, the earlier you do this, the harder it will be and my first attempt at it on Disc 3 meant that I was well prepared for the challenge. Also, you probably don't have much need for BP at this point so it may be best to use the slots exploit to give yourself handicaps that have minimal effect, such as status effects, rather than take big BP handicaps like breaking equipment or removing materia. A first time successful finish nets you the Final Attack materia and the achievement.

You need to buy a Chocobo Lure materia (or get the free one in Disc 2) at the Chocobo Ranch and equip it. Get into a random battle on chocobo tracks for a chance for a chocobo to appear, feed the chocobo some greens, and then quickly kill the other enemies. If the chocobo is still around by the time the other monsters are dispatched, you'll appear on the world map riding the chocobo and this achievement will unlock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

It actually looks like a map rather than a flyer as it uses what looks to be the Great Glacier map texture.</details>- Flyer 6: Tee hee hee... all of this materia AND the final Turtle's Paradise flyer! They'll never find it here!<br><br><details>After recruiting Yuffie and heading toward Wutai, all of your materia will be stolen. Proceed through the Stolen Materia side quest until you corner Yuffie and appear in her house. Follow her downstairs and the final flyer will be on the wall next to the door and opposite of the stairs you came down.</details><br>To get the reward, you must have read all of the flyers as well as the sign outside of the Turtle's Paradise bar that describes the promotion, and then speak with the bartender. |

This shouldn't be an issue since getting the **Ninja of the Gods** challenge achievement requires the Wutai side quests all be completed in Disc 1 anyway. The ideal time to do this is right after getting the Tiny Bronco, since you appear on the world map right off the coast of the Wutai continent. The achievement is unlocked upon getting all of your materia back.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Go inside to see two kids and another person in the flower garden. Walk a little bit forward and that person disappears and the achievement unlocks.<br>People in the comments for this achievement mentioned that there is potentially a bug involving the Kalm flashback sequence and an appearance of Aerith in the church in Midgar's Sector 5 during Disc 2. If you talk to the Innkeeper in Nibelheim during the flashback and say "Let me know the situation of the town", it prevents the person from appearing in the church. I could not confirm that this was an issue. However, if it does happen to you, this cutscene is compatible with the low level run so you'll have another attempt to accomplish this.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The information you get in game is not the best. There are a ton of guides out there about how to do it efficiently. I personally used https://chocobo-guide.mikestomb.com initially. Part of the problem is the Random Number Generator issue that can result in getting the same green chocobo every time. I personally experienced this and couldn't fix the problem. So, I started over and used this guide: https://pastebin.com/raw/Z94pGCuj.

### Steal/Morph

Stealing requires the Steal materia equipped on a party member to enable the command which you will first find as you escape from Don Corneo's pet in the sewers. It is a very useful skill to have as quite a few enemies have rare equipment and items that can only be obtained this way. These achievements serve to alert players to enemies that have particular equipment that can be of great use when they appear in the game. The main problem is knowing where these fiends can be located.<br>Another issue is that if the Steal materia levels up, it becomes Mug instead, which means that enemies will be attacked simultaneously and potentially killed. In my experience, this was not an issue as I had another Steal materia when my first one leveled up but it definitely is something to be aware of.<br>Stealing chance is based on the difference in level between the character stealing and the target enemy. To learn more about how stealing works in the game, check out [Terence Fergusson's guide on Enemy Mechanics on GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/31903), section 2.1.2.

Morphing requires the Morph materia, found in the Temple of the Ancients, and is fairly straightforward to use. When using the Morph skill, the character attacks the enemy. If that attack is the killing blow, the enemy will be morphed into an item. The wrinkle is that Morph reduces the character's attack to 1/8th of their normal attack (with the exception of Yuffie's ultimate weapon). 

**NOTE:** Identifying enemies is made easier by having the Help window open during battles (press Select to toggle it on or off). The window will display the name of the enemy being targeted.

Make sure to equip the Steal materia obtained from the sewers and then steal the Striking Staff from the monster. Since it is a rarer encounter than others in the area, it's possible that you may not find an Eligor before reaching the exit. If that is the case, circle around near the exit until one shows up. In my case, I had about six encounters and ran from them all while my team built up their limit gauges. When it showed, it took about six attempts to do the steal (Tifa was my stealer). Once I got the staff and achievement, I unleashed limits (Aerith healed with Healing Wind and used the Fire spell) and defeated the fiend.</details>                                                                                 |

If you need help knowing which head is which, press Select to open up the help window that shows what your cursor is pointing at. It'll say "Schizo (Right)".

Only the truly attentive will achieve elemental bliss.<br><br><details>There are three Elemental materia to find in the entire game. The achievement doesn't track the progress of unlocking it and two of the three materia are very easily missable so caution is necessary.<br>- 1: Solve the puzzle by Mayor Domino in the Shinra Headquarters on the first attempt to get the first Elemental materia.<br>- 2: During the Kalm flashback, go into Tifa's house and her bedroom and examine her piano. Say, "Yeah, I jammed on it" (second option) and play some notes to be sure. Later, as Tifa after the events at Whirlwind Maze while searching for Cloud, go check the piano in present day Nibelheim. Tifa will find the Elemental materia. This will be your last missable materia AND potentially the one that unlocks this achievement, if you already got the next one.<br>- 3: The only non-missable Elemental materia is found in the natural mako spring in Mt. Nibel, which you will go to naturally over the course of your time at this location. It'll be on the left of the spring's fountain in the water/mako.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Only the truly attentive will achieve beastmastery.<br><br><details>There are four Enemy Skill materia to find in the entire game. The achievement doesn't track the progress of unlocking it but only the first of the four is missable.<br>- 1: After defeating Sample: H0512, the first Enemy Skill materia will be on the ground at the entrance of the sample chamber.<br>- 2: After the parade in Junon, enter the last door in the first area of the city proper.

Talk to the one near the fence and say "Wark" (first option) to get the Choco/Mog summon materia.<br>- 2: The Enemy Skill materia given to you by the Chocobo Sage's green chocobo also gives you the second check toward this achievement.<br>- 3: Return to Bill's Chocobo Ranch after Meteor was summoned and you have the Highwind to find a Chocobo Lure materia on the ground to the right of the entrance.<br>- 4: Coax the Mideel chocobo running around with the panicking person in the various shops by giving it a Mimett Green (the game refers to it as Samolen) and tickle it behind the ears to get a Contain materia and this achievement.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

You can pick some of them up with the other color chocobos as they're bred, but it's more convenient to get them all with the gold.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

You will want to have one main materia that you use to get all skills on. Keep track of this materia and, ideally, keep it equipped at all times (enemy skills are so useful anyway). The main problem here is knowing which enemies have skills that can be learned, what is needed to get the enemy to use the skill (is it random or does it need to be manipulated?), and which skills are missable. Check the [table below](#stragos-tribute) for the order in which enemy skills can be learned as soon as they are available. Hidden here is a consolidated list of all of the skills in the order shown in game:<br><br><details>Frog Song - Touch Me<br>L4 Suicide - Mu<br>Magic Hammer - Razor Weed<br>White Wind - Zemzelett<br>Big Guard - Beachplug<br>Angel Whisper - Pollensalta<br>Dragon Force - Dark Dragon<br>Death Force - Adamantaimai<br>Flame Thrower - Ark Dragon<br>Laser - Death Claw<br>Matra Magic - Custom Sweeper<br>Bad Breath - Malboro<br>Beta - Midgar Zolom<br>Aqualung - Harpy<br>Trine - Materia Keeper (missable)<br>Magic Breath - Stilva<br>???? - Jersey<br>Goblin Punch - Goblin<br>Chocobuckle - Chocobo<br>L5 Death - Parasite<br>Death Sentence - Gi Spector/Sneaky Step<br>Roulette - Death Dealer<br>Shadow Flare - Ultimate Weapon<br>Pandora's Box - Dragon Zombie (missable)</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This is accomplished in the following manner:<br>- Equip all mastered materia of a given category onto any mandatory party members (i.e. NOT Yuffie or Vincent). This includes characters not in the active party. Again, NOT Vincent or Yuffie!!<br>- Equip any NON-MASTERED materia from that category into an active party member so that it gain AP. Ideally, you'd use Cloud's Apocalypse for the triple growth rate.<br>- Fight Movers to quickly master the non-mastered materia. When it masters, the associated materia type achievement will unlock!<br><br>**Example**: In the Summon category, equip all mastered summon materia to characters not in your party (again, NOT Yuffie or Vincent). Equip a new Choco/Mog materia created from mastering to Cloud's Apocalypse. Grind AP to master the materia. When Choco/Mog is mastered, the **Summon Master** achievement will unlock.<br><br>*This is really complicated!* - Yep! However, this is probably the best way for the achievement  creator to make the check that a player has mastered every materia in a given category, at the time of another materia reaching mastery. With a little bit of planning ahead of time, and **NOT using the Huge Materia for creating Master Materia before hand**, you can get these achievement without too much hassle.<br><br>*Why not Yuffie and Vincent?* With how complicated this achievement is, the rules to code the requirements would be very detailed. Rather than add checks for the optional characters, it is easier to use the required characters only. By this point in the game, you should have more than enough materia slots on the six mandatory characters to hold all of the mastered materia as well as the materia being mastered. The Magic materia category has the most materia in it's category with a count of 21 which won't fill all of the slots when you use 6 slot weapons and armor on all six eligible characters (that's 72 slots, more than enough to even work on multiple achievements at once).<br><br>*It didn't unlock! I had all materia in a category equipped!* Double check. Go through the list, count the materia equipped, and ensure they are **NOT** on Yuffie and Vincent. Make sure to **NOT** fast forward through the results screen when you get close to mastery.<br><br>Here are all of the materia categories, the materia in the category, and the AP required to master them:<br><br>Magic (21 materia/1,010,000 AP to master all):<details>Ultima (100,000 AP)<br>Shield (100,000 AP)<br>Full Cure (100,000 AP)<br>Contain (60,000 AP)<br>Destruct (45,000 AP)<br>Time (38,000 AP)<br>Comet (60,000 AP)<br>Barrier (45,000 AP)<br>Gravity (40,000 AP)<br>Poison (38,000 AP)<br>Exit (30,000 AP)<br>Transform (24,000 AP)<br>Mystify (25,000 AP)<br>Seal (20,000 AP) - Lowest AP to master<br>Revive (55,000 AP)<br>Heal (45,000 AP)<br>Restore (40,000 AP)<br>Lightning (35,000 AP)<br>Earth (40,000 AP)<br>Ice (35,000 AP)<br>Fire (35,000 AP)</details><br><br>Support (13 materia/1,795,000 AP to master all):<details>Quadra Magic (200,000 AP)<br>Steal as Well (200,000 AP)<br>Added Cut (200,000 AP)<br>Final Attack (160,000 AP)<br>Sneak Attack (100,000 AP)<br>Added Effect (100,000 AP)<br>Elemental (80,000 AP)<br>HP Absorb (100,000 AP)<br>MP Absorb (100,000 AP)<br>MP Turbo (120,000 AP)<br>Magic Counter (300,000 AP)<br>Counter (100,000 AP)<br>All (35,000 AP) - Lowest AP to master</details><br><br>Command (13 materia/1,480,000 AP to master all):<details>Enemy Skill (N/A)<br>Mime (100,000 AP)<br>Manipulate (40,000 AP) - Tied for lowest AP to master<br>Deathblow (40,000 AP) - Tied for lowest AP to master<br>Morph (100,000 AP)<br>Throw (60,000 AP)<br>Sense (40,000 AP) - Tied for lowest AP to master<br>Steal (50,000 AP)<br>W-Item (250,000 AP)<br>W-Summon (250,000 AP)<br>W-Magic (250,000 AP)<br>Double Cut (150,000 AP)<br>Slash-All (150,000 AP)</details><br><br>Independent (17 materia/1,290,000 AP to master all):<details>HP<->MP (80,000 AP)<br>Underwater (N/A)<br>Cover (40,000 AP)<br>Counter Attack (100,000 AP)<br>Mega All (160,000 AP)<br>Long Range (80,000 AP)<br>Pre-Emptive (50,000 AP)<br>Chocobo Lure (30,000 AP) - Lowest AP to master<br>Enemy Lure (50,000 AP)<br>Enemy Away (50,000 AP)<br>Gil Plus (150,000 AP)<br>EXP Plus (150,000 AP)<br>Luck Plus (100,000 AP)<br>Magic Plus (50,000 AP)<br>Speed Plus (100,000 AP)<br>HP Plus (50,000 AP)<br>MP Plus (50,000 AP)</details><br><br>Summon (16 materia/2,535,000 AP to master all):<details>Knights of the Round (500,000 AP)<br>Bahamut ZERO (250,000 AP)<br>Typoon (250,000 AP)<br>Hades (250,000 AP)<br>Neo Bahamut (150,000 AP)<br>Phoenix (250,000 AP)<br>Alexander (150,000 AP)<br>Kjata (140,000 AP)<br>Bahamut (120,000 AP)<br>Leviathan (100,000 AP)<br>Odin (80,000 AP)<br>Titan (80,000 AP)<br>Ramuh (70,000 AP)<br>Ifrit (60,000 AP)<br>Shiva (50,000 AP)<br>Choco/Mog (35,000 AP) - Lowest AP to master</details> |

If you have met these requirements, interact with the Huge Materia for it to fuse the mastered materia together into one Magic/Command/Summon Master materia.<br>Command is the easiest to get this with, because only seven materia need to be mastered to get it (Deathblow, Manipulate, Mime, Morph, Sense, Steal, and Throw).<br><br>Note that doing this ***WILL*** consume the mastered materia so only do this if you haven't disposed of the cloned materia created from mastery, you've already earned the applicable **[Materia Type] Master** achievement above, or you don't mind grinding TONS of AP on cloned materia. For achievement purposes, I would focus on the Command type as it is certainly the easiest and requires the least AP of all of the categories for the applicable materia: 430,000 AP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Strago's Tribute

This is a list of enemy skills as soon as they can be obtained, the monster that uses the skill, where they are located and how they use it, as well as if it is missable. To learn the skill, you must be hit by the skill and then win the battle. Running from the battle does not count. Note that skills that start with L?, like "L4 Suicide", don't have to apply the effect of the skill on the character that has the materia. The person with the materia also does not have to survive the battle as long as at least one person survives to win the fight.

##### Notes

- **Note 1 (Chocobuckle)**: Use L4 Suicide on a chocobo that has a level at a multiple of 4. Conveniently, there are level 16 chocobos near the Mu enemies that teach L4 Suicide. So learn that skill first then get into an encounter that has a chocobo. If the chocobo is with two Elfadunks or two Levikrons, that chocobo is level 16. Give the chocobo a Mimett green, use L4 Suicide, and the chocobo will counter with Chocobuckle on the Enemy Skill materia user.
- **Note 2 (Beta)**: Make use of the Sadness status on the character with the Enemy Skill materia. Put Fire-Elemental linked materia on that character's armor as well. Equipping a Talisman accessory can further reduce damage. Hit the Midgar Zolom with Bio to poison the fiend, use limits as they come up, and defend with the Enemy Skill materia equipped character. Once a character is ejected, Beta can occur as a counter attack. Once Beta is learned, cast it back. Midgar Zolom should die or be close to dying from poison. This took a few tries to get... Timing played a big part in this. Give it a few attempts and adjust strategy to attempt to bait the Beta attack while also having done enough damage to retaliate with Beta as well and knock out the remaining HP in one shot. I was able to succeed with Cloud at Level 14 with around 550 HP. On my successful attempt, when Beta hit, Cloud had 100-ish HP remaining and Midgar Zolom did another physical attack for about 80 HP before I could attack with Beta and win the fight.
- **Note 3 (????)**: Jersey will only use ???? if not damaged and is not available in the enemy's manipulate actions list. I recommend eliminating all but one Jersey without hurting it and then being patient and healing yourselves until it does ???? on the right character.
- **Note 4 (Trine)**: Materia Keeper either opens the battle with Trine (1 in 4 chance) or begins to use it closer to the end of the fight. If you don't get the enemy skill during this battle, it is only used by Godo in the Wutai Pagoda (who can only be fought once) and Stilva in Gaea's Cliff (which is only visited once).
- **Note 5 (Magic Breath)**: If you didn't get this from Stilva for some reason, you can still get it from a Parasite in the Northern Crater.
- **Note 6 (Shadow Flare)**: Ultimate Weapon uses Shadow Flare on the character who deals the final blow. So, the ideal thing to do is to have that person be equipped with your Enemy Skill materia that is nearly full at this point. Make use of the Select+R1 Sense ability to track Ultimate Weapon's HP. If you can't get it in this fight, Dragon Zombies in the Northern Crater Graveyard area can oblige.
- **Note 7 (Pandora's Box)**: The skill is only used as a final attack by the Dragon Zombie ***ONCE PER SAVE FILE***, seemingly due to a bug. Make sure that your Enemy Skill materia with all of the other skills is equipped while going through the Northern Crater Graveyard.

You WOULD?! Perhaps seeing it there and leaving it is better. If only there was a way to go back in time and change our decisions...<br><br><details>In the first visit to Sector 5 Slums, a kid is sleeping in their bedroom on the second floor of their home. When spoken to, they mumble information about a secret drawer. If you check the dresser, an option to open the hidden drawer exists. If you select that, you'll find 5 gil and given the option to take or leave it. Here is where the achievements are mutually exclusive:<br>- **Killing Hope**: Take the 5 gil. Easy enough.<br>- **Good Things Happen For Those Who Wait**: Select the "Leave it" option. Progress through the game until the fall of the Sector 7 plate. When you return to Sector 5, stop in the house and speak to the kid, who is awake now. They'll give you a Turbo Ether and this achievement.<br><br>This achievement is potentially a good candidate for splitting between the normal and low level runs of the game. However, picking up the 5 gil is tied to the **Above and Below the Plate** treasure achievement. Fortunately, there is a save crystal very close by at Aerith's house and the 5 gil is the last item for the treasure achievement. Save your game and take the gil to get both the treasure achievement and **Killing Hope**. Reload the save and now observe that the money is there but leave it. You'll then get **Good Things Happen...** later on and a Turbo Ether for your trouble.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Will it be you? Dress to impress, or don't. It's your choice.<br><br><details>These four are tied closely together and largely depend on whether you decide to have Cloud get picked by Don Corneo or not. While the Honeybee Inn itself is completely optional in getting the Don to take Cloud (you only need the Silk Dress, Blonde Wig, Diamond Tiara, and Sexy Cologne), the achievements demand we do the events there. Therefore, if you want Don Corneo to pick Cloud, you must pick the Group Room. Another factor to consider is if you are doing the normal or the low level playthrough. If you want to split these pairs of achievements up with those runs, you pretty much need to have Don Corneo take Cloud when doing **David and Goliath**. So, for a normal run, get **Taking Out the Small Fry** and **A Fuck Up Moment**, then get the other two with the low level run.<br>The other option is to do all four during the normal run, which is what I did in my playthroughs:<br>- Before doing anything, save your game in Wall Market as our point to reset back to for these four achievements.<br>- Get **Taking Out the Small Fry** and **A Fuck Up Moment** first. You can ensure that Tifa is chosen by selecting the first option twice when talking to the Dress Shop owner, which will give Cloud the Cotton Dress, meaning that performance in the squat minigame will have no impact on the selection. Reset after the **Taking Out the Small Fry** achievement is unlocked.<br>- Now reload the save from earlier and proceed with the game, getting **Group Bath** and **Dude (Looks Like a Lady)** and potentially picking up **Workout Plan** along the way. To get the best dress, choose the second option twice when talking to the Dress Shop owner. Out-squat in the gym to get the Blonde Wig. Get the Diamond Tiara from the materia shop owner by listening to their request, staying at the inn, getting the 200 gil item, and going back to the materia shop. Get the Sexy Cologne by getting the pharmacy coupon from the diner (choose any meal and say "It was all right"), select the Digestive (third option), and giving it to the person in the bar's bathroom. Take the Group Room in the Honeybee Inn. Don Corneo will then pick Cloud.</details> |

So which will you choose?<br><br><details>This is a perfect pair of achievements to split between the normal and **David and Goliath** runs. Storm the front and take the elevator in the normal run. Take the stairs for **David and Goliath**. There is an Elixir on the stairs that you'll need to pick up at some point for the **Shinra Inc** treasure achievement but it can be grabbed in either visit to Shinra Headquarters. In my own experience, I split the achievements up and doubled back down the stairs in my first visit to get the Elixir.<br>It is possible to get both achievements in the first playthrough given that there is a save crystal right outside the entrance of Shinra Headquarters, but there really is no reason to do both right away when you have to do a low level playthrough as well.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## David and Goliath Low Level Challenge

This is a low level run challenge, requiring that no character exceeds level 28 by the conclusion of the game. This requires careful planning and knowledge of the game to do successfully. Doing the normal run prior to attempting **David and Goliath** is highly recommended as a result. This section of the guide discusses how to plan for this challenge as well as presents a plan to follow if you'd rather not go through that process.

The primary guide that I used for planning my path through this achievement is [GarlandG's GameFAQs guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/32536) with backup from the [main guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/71240). Despite GarlandG's guide being a Low Level AND No Materia run, the notes are still applicable and well detailed regarding how to route this. I didn't follow it exactly, but it was a great starting point for figuring out how to do this since I hadn't attempted something like this before.

[My potential route](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zcRNy5fL4upn2-4mmLgG84U-_hoz-JZcjyGvY2ELoek/edit?usp=sharing) is available here as a Google Sheet. Make a copy of the sheet for your own use so that you can update the encounters in your plan as you see fit.

The route spreadsheet is set up to calculate the XP values earned by the active character and inactive party members while telling you how much total XP they have, the level it equates to, and the buffer to reaching level 29 (the level cell turns yellow at level 28 and red at 29). This will allow you to make your own adjustments to the route based on how you want to tackle it and see how it impacts the buffer, while ALSO providing a way to do live route updating.

The route plan is, by no means, required to be strictly followed. In fact, it could certainly be optimized more to spread the XP around. The game is flexible enough to give many solutions to the problems you'll face. Feel free to update the route to fit your needs and wishes on how you want to accomplish this achievement. The main reason why I created the spreadsheet for planning the route was so that others can come up with something more efficient or more fun for them. This is not set in stone! Have some fun with it!

Guide format: Sections are broken up by location. Encounters are in bold and followed by potential tactics based on my route. Between battles will be discussion on important item pickups from the area.

### General guidance

- Run from all random encounters.
- SAVE SAVE SAVE and use multiple slots and memory card files!!!
- Pincer attacks will be the death of many an attempt between saves... you can kill one side of the enemies to run without gaining XP, but that is risky and can result in lost consumables to heal. I find it better to just reset most of the time.
- Get items from chests/bags/etc. in the area.
- Cloud will get all of the Sources. Give them to him as you go, or save them up and use them all at once prior to the final fights.
- Money is tight until Steal materia is obtained.
- Healing items will also be tight and their use needs to be carefully thought out.
- Chocobuckle is obtained during this run but I didn't really end up using it. It is definitely an avenue you can take if you wish, but I decided to use the W-Item materia duplication trick as my cheese method for the late game rather than spend time running away a lot. This enabled me to provide strategies for the majority of the game that weren't just "Use Chocobuckle and win". By the time I reached the final dungeon, I had only run around 380 times when I remembered to check my progress. If you want to make the challenge a bit easier, you can take the time with fast forward and running from encounters near areas where you can heal for free.
- A calculator and Sense materia are unnecessary! Pressing Select+R1 on the controller will bring up an HP indicator using the RetroAchievements user interface. Very handy!
- You can check that the party's XP values are tracking properly with the spreadsheet by deleting all entries temporarily below the last battle that you just completed. That will show you the expected XP for each character on the table and then you can verify each character's XP in-game in the Status menu or in PHS by double selecting the character. Once you verified that everything is progressing properly with your plan, press Ctrl+Z on the spreadsheet to restore the deleted entries. If something is off, you now have an opportunity to either go to a prior save OR update your plan to accommodate. I recommend verifying your progress every few battles or so. It could save you a LOT of time, effort, and sanity!

### Saving strategy

- Just as I did with the normal run, I made checkpoint saves from File 15 and up, using File 1 as the current save.
- So prior to any boss fight, save to the next File up from the bottom available AND on File 1.
- This makes it easier to restart games.
- Once a memory card is full, roll back memory cards (Card 1 becomes Card 2, Card 2 becomes Card 3, and so on) by renaming the files.
  - With DuckStation, if you configured it so that every game has unique memory cards, your files would be located in the Documents/DuckStation/memcards folder by default and are probably named Final Fantasy VII (USA)_**X**.mcd, where **X** is the slot number. So, when you fill up Final Fantasy VII (USA)_1.mcd, rename it to Final Fantasy VII (USA)_2.mcd, Final Fantasy VII (USA)_2.mcd to Final Fantasy VII (USA)_3.mcd, etc. DuckStation will automatically make Final Fantasy VII (USA)_1.mcd for you.
- I use the following notation for remarking on making a new save slot: **(second card: 14/15)**.
  - xxx card: The memory card being saved to. While we are rotating memory card files, we are always using slot one. The "xxxxxx card" nomenclature is to state how many memory cards we have progressed through. In our example, this is the second memory card file we have used, even though it is in slot one.
  - x/15: The x is the file number on this memory card. For this example, we are making an archive save in the 14th file (second from the bottom). The save files will start on the bottom and work their way up to the top until it's full (reaches the second file). This will give you an archive of saves to fall back on if a mistake is made, allowing to go back in time to the spot where you could potential correct the issue.
  - Here is a stitched together save screen showing my progress up to the Shinra Building and the save slots that I used up to that point as discussed in the guide: ![Stitched together screenshots of the save files in Final Fantasy VII, demonstrating a working save at File 1 and archived saves 12-15](https://i.imgur.com/7zViMEl.png)

### Walkthrough

This covers the battles primarily, as well as preparation for said battles and where to save. There may be call outs for specific items to grab in shops or in chests but the guide relies on your knowledge of a normal playthrough of the game for the most part. Additionally, this obviously covers the encounter plan that I've laid out above. You'll need to adjust based on any deviations that you make for your own plan and playthrough.

I also call out Turtle's Paradise flyers in this walkthrough in case you want to go to Wutai and do the Stolen Materia and Turtle's Paradise side quests though I don't actually route that event into my plan. Since the second flyer is missable, I felt it was important to call them out anyway, in case you decide to make Wutai a priority.

#### Disc 1: Midgar

##### Reactor 1 Bombing Mission

**MP x2 fight**: Cloud is the only participant and earns 32 XP, reaching level 7. Enough said about that fight.

After the fight, the knocked out guards have Potions that will be useful for healing. There is a Phoenix Down off the beaten path if you want, but it may not be necessary. Consider putting Barret in the back row. Save before the boss fight (first card: 15/15). Consider setting up for the escape encounter plan as you did for **The Great Escape** achievement to reduce the number of fights you have to run from and potential damage sustained/death.

**Guard Scorpion (800 HP)**: As a reminder, you can press Select+R1 to bring up the boss' HP and it'll count down as you deal damage to it. Cloud uses Bolt and Barret attacks. My route is to have Barret survive so when Guard Scorpion raises it's tail, have Barret defend while Cloud attacks it so Cloud takes a bunch of damage. When the boss's HP get's low, let Cloud die or take him out yourself and then finish the job with Barret's low damage output. You shouldn't need to heal during the fight (and it'll consume potions) so if things go south, consider resetting and trying again. Note Barret's starting XP on the victory screen. If it isn't 395 XP, you fought random encounters so you'll probably want to start over.

Run from the encounters. When getting cornered by the guards in Sector 8 as you make your way to the train, make sure to say "Later" (second option), otherwise you'll have to reset (the fights are unrunnable).

##### Sector 7/Reactor 5 Bombing Mission

Progress the story at Seventh Heaven, then head to the Beginner's Hall to get an All materia and Ether. Purchase some Potions at the item shop (GarlandG gets 8 of them) and Grenades at the weapon shop (GarlandG buys 6 intended for Smoggers but we can use them elsewhere). Save and head to the train.

When the alert goes off, get all the items just like during the normal run (talk to the man laying down in the back of the first car for a Phoenix Down, the man at the front of the second car for a Hi-Potion). Get to the reactor, picking up items as you go, and set the bomb.

Preparation for Air Buster: At the save crystal before the fight, save in a new slot (first card: 14/15) and then get into a battle and kill off Tifa. Have Cloud and Barret fill their limit gauges. Once Barret's gauge is full, move him to the back row and defend. Get Cloud's HP down low (GarlandG recommends below 35) and then escape.

**Air Buster (1200 HP)**: Use Barret and Cloud's limit breaks and Air Buster's counter attacks will kill off Cloud. Barret then throws a Grenade and wins! Note Tifa's starting XP on the victory screen and update it if it isn't 102 XP.

##### Plate Collapse

Get Aerith safely through the church escape (no encounters like we did for the normal run). Check **A Flower Blooming in the Slums** for details. Check on the kid's secret stash of 5 gil in the Sector 5 Slums and leave it (we still want that Turbo Ether later on, just in case) and look at Turtle's Paradise Flyer #1. Loot Aerith's garden for the Ether. Stock up on Grenades as our primary damage source. GarlandG then sells a bunch of stuff in order to buy 66 Grenades. We need to have at least 280 gil for Wall Market so save that much at least. We are good to sell Ethers for now (magic cost is low at the moment) so use them to get the necessary gil. I sold all Ethers, the Assault Gun, and the Titan Bangle and bought the Grenades, having 315 gil left over. Now go inside Aerith's house to advance the story.

In Wall Market, get the necessary items to get picked by Don Corneo: Silk Dress (say "soft" and "shimmers"), Blonde Wig (win the squat contest), Diamond Tiara (help the materia shop owner with buying the 200 gil item at the inn vending machine), and Sexy Cologne (food "all right" at restaurant, Digestive at pharmacy, give to person in bar restroom). Honey Bee Inn is not required. Save in preparation for the upcoming boss fight (first card: 13/15).

Get dropped into the sewers and go into the menu before talking to Tifa and Aerith. It is now Aerith's time to shine as the primary receiver of XP for Disc 1. Cloud and Tifa are front row and Aerith in back. Cover materia can be useful for helping Cloud or Tifa die faster while protecting Aerith. Aerith will get targeted with tail attacks by being in the back row, but that should be fine.

**Aps (1800 HP)**: Grenades! Aps has a regular attack pattern: Sewer Tsunami, two rounds of Lick and/or tail attack, repeat; Sewer Tsunami alternates behind him to behind party with every two uses. All characters throw Grenades for the first three rounds (so 9 Grenades used), having Cloud and Tifa attack Cloud to even out HP, then they die from Sewer Tsunami (kill them if one/both survive) and Aps is one Grenade away from Aerith winning the battle.

Heal up Aerith and run through the sewers (and from encounters, of course). I had a limit break on Aerith at the end of the fight so I used a potion (Aerith had 23 HP left so I wanted to make sure the limit would go off) and healed her the rest of the way with the limit in a battle. Grab that Steal materia!!! That'll be crucial for items/money gathering. Run through the Train Graveyard and steal Ethers from Deenglow (revive the others with available Phoenix Downs if things get scary). If you head out to Sector 7, you can't return to Train Graveyard so make sure you steal as much as you are willing to grab. Keep in mind: 99 Ethers equates to 74,250 gil so use that value to determine how much you are willing to grind. While Aerith's Healing Wind will do a lot to carry your HP recovery, it won't be enough and you'll need to use some Potions as well. Keep in mind that more Ethers means even more Potions that you can buy so figure out a balance and use the Potions you have to get even more Ethers. Don't bother trying to steal the Striking Staff from Eligor or Ghost Hands from Ghosts (these encounters will wreck you). I got owned a couple of times from Deenglows landing critical hits, so be cautious when HP gets to critical levels (yellow). There will be future Ether grinding opportunities later as well so it isn't worth it to burn Phoenix Downs for this Ether grind. I had 19 Potions at the start of the theft grind and got 41 Ethers and 4 Potions remaining when I stopped.

At Sector 7, you have another opportunity to shop and save (first card: 13/15). Sell off the number of Ethers you want to get rid of and stock up on Grenades and Potions if needed (I capped out on Grenades and bought 20 Potions). Climb the pillar stairs, equip yourself properly once united with Barret, and put Cloud/Tifa in front and Barret in the back.

**Reno (1000 HP)**: Take out the pyramids as they show up like usual. Throw Grenades with the whole party until Reno is nearly down. When in killing range, have Cloud and Tifa take themselves out while also ensuring no pyramids are up. Once Barret is left and no pyramid, finish off Reno. I did have to burn off an extra Grenade on a pyramid because Tifa had a limit break when a pyramid was placed over Barret, but otherwise the battle was pretty straight forward. The reason why we want to get Reno down to killing range of a Grenade before knocking out Cloud and Tifa is because if Reno places a pyramid on your lone character, it's a game over.

##### Shinra Headquarters/Escape from Midgar

Follow the story path by going to Aerith's house (pick up the Turbo Ether from the kid on the way), then head back to Wall Market. Be cautious on the Sector 6 highway as there is potential for pincer attacks that could result in needing to reset. Pick up the Sense materia if you want, but it really isn't needed and Red will come with one. In Wall Market, stock up on supplies, if necessary, ensuring you have 300 gil at least to buy the batteries in the weapon shop. Pick up the batteries and the left over item(s) in Don Corneo's mansion, then climb up the golden shiny wire of hope. Grab the Ether with one of the batteries on the way up.

At Shinra HQ, take the stairs (second option) as we don't want to be fighting anything, obviously. Use the save crystal (first card: 12/15) at the entrance (though if the Mighty Grunt fight goes sideways for some reason, that's going to be a long climb back up the stairs...). Pick up the Elixir on the way up (and **The Stairmaster** achievement if you didn't get it in the normal run). At the top of the stairs are three Mighty Grunts. Heal up Barret and jump in.

**Mighty Grunts x3 (230 HP)**: Two Grenades per enemy to take them out. Cloud was revived during the story events so he'll need to be taken out first. Otherwise, this is pretty cut and dry. I had Cloud attack himself, while Barret threw Grenades at the enemies.

After the fight, I took the elevator back down to the first floor, read Turtle's Paradise Flyer #2, and saved again just in case I somehow messed up the stealth section on the 60th floor. After getting past the stealth, head up to the 62nd floor (no encounters to worry about currently) and solve Mayor Domino's puzzle (see the notes on **Top Quizzer** for the easy way to do this). I'll leave it up to you to decide if you want the Elemental materia or the second place prize of an Elixir. The Elixir could prove useful in the late game for guaranteed full health (and duplication with W-Item later) while Elemental provides some extra protection against specific elements if planned ahead of time. I'm opting for the Elemental materia. Get all the coupons on the 63rd floor to get the All materia, Star Pendant accessory, and Four Slots armor. If you happen to run into a Moth Slasher, feel free to try to get a Carbon Bangle. Equip Barret with the Star Pendant and Four Slots or Carbon Bangle (revive if necessary). Rest and save on the 64th floor (first card: 11/15).

Press on up the floors to the 67th, get the Poison materia from the chest, put Barret in the back and Cloud in the front, and save again (you can use the same spot as previous, if you wish; I did). Red XIII joins the group for the fight against the Sample, making sure to send off Tifa (first option).

**Sample: H0512 (1000 HP)**: With our survivor wearing the Star Pendant, the poison status won't land on them and could hit the others so that they can die faster. The Select+R1 trick doesn't seem to work for this fight as it focuses on the opts, so use Red's Sense or a calculator to track Sample's health. Have everyone toss Grenades at Sample, ignoring the opts in the front row. Seven Grenades will put Sample near death at which point it's time to kill off Red and Cloud. Once they are down, throw the last Grenade or use a limit break (if available) so Barret gets the win and XP. On the victory screen, note Red's starting XP value and update the tracker if it isn't 961 XP.

With Aerith back, pick her and Barret to join Cloud and give Aerith the Four Slots/Carbon Bangle and Star Pendent. PICK UP THE ENEMY SKILL MATERIA!!! Get the potions lying around the lab too, if you need them. Proceed through the story (everyone will be healed after the jail scene; think about Barret first if you are trying to get the Gold Saucer date with him; exploit the conversation with Tifa to get her hidden cutscene at the end of Disc 2 if you need that). Use the save crystal on the 69th floor (first card: 10/15) as we have three battles in a row across two teams. When you get control of Aerith (everyone is healed here), place her in the back row and others in the front and get ready to toss more Grenades! You can put Lightning materia on Aerith if you'd like to use it, but it may still not damage more than Grenades...

**Hundred Gunner (1600 HP)**: We have two fights in a row so don't worry about taking out any party members yet. Just throw Grenades/use Bolt magic/limit breaks.

**Heli Gunner (1000 HP)**: Heli Gunner can inflict Poison and Sleep status. Aerith should be fine, even with Sleep. Be cautious with the Sleep status though, as any characters sleeping with an action queued will do that action as soon as they wake up (could be bad if the boss' HP is nearly gone). Healing Wind will be your friend, but use Potions in a pinch. Toss Grenades until Heli Gunner hits 250 HP and it's defense will increase. Grenades will only do about 125 HP of damage at this point so get Heli down to 120 HP or so before taking out Barret and Red, then Aerith can finish the job.

Equip Cloud with the Mythril Armlet for some extra defense. Do worry about Dark Nation. If you have concerns, and you grabbed the Elemental materia, use Elemental-Lightning on your armor.

**Rufus (500 HP)**: Four Grenades at Rufus and that's a wrap. The Grenades ignore the Barrier that Dark Nation can put up on Rufus.

Heal Cloud if needed as there are encounters still. Save again on floor 69 (first card: 9/15). When you form a new party, bring Tifa and Aerith, placing everyone in the front row (they'll be in the back when the next boss fight happens). Place Mythril Armlet/Carbon Bangle on Aerith. If you have the Elemental materia, use Elemental-Fire on the armor. Enjoy the minigame and then...

**Motor Ball (2600 HP)**: This is probably the first scary fight of the challenge, especially if you aren't as great at the bike minigame. Chuck Grenades to get the mech's HP down quickly, trying to skip the Rolling Fire attacks where possible, which does 200 HP of damage to everyone (Aerith will take less with the Fire-Elemental armor). You know that Rolling Fire is coming when Motor Ball unpacks itself three turns after it packs up and uses Twin Burner. You may be able to prevent the first use of Rolling Fire, but probably not the second. That second one should take out Cloud and Tifa, or get them close. As with other battles, once HP gets close to a single Grenade range, ensure Cloud and Tifa are dead and then Aerith throws the last one. Good luck!

#### Disc 1: The Rest

##### Kalm Flashback/Junon

You escaped Midgar! Congrats! Now it is time to save (first card: 8/15). Bring Aerith and Barret with you as you head out (Barret gains an affinity point). On your way to Kalm, you can farm Ethers by stealing from Kalm Fangs and Levikrons. Prowlers also have them and are easier to steal from, but they also steal from you and run away too, so that's not great. If you are going to steal farm, make sure to put everyone in the back row and save often.

Head to Kalm and get through the flashback sequence. Head back to the Inn's second floor and open the cupboard five times to get the Megalixir. Grab other items around Kalm, stock up on Potions if needed, sell what you don't need (we want 3500 gil soon if you plan to get Chocobuckle), and then head toward the Chocobo Ranch. Make a party of Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith. Equip Aerith with the Enemy Skill materia. This is a good point to save again because it's time to learn L4 Suicide and Chocobuckle (I used the same save file: 8/15).

It seems like the only encounter that has a Mu in it is the 2 Mu/1 Levikron battle. There are a ton of enemy formations though and they are going to be painful, even trying to run from them. Expect plenty of back attacks from the Levikron packs. Save near the Chocobo Ranch and soft-reset (hold all four shoulder buttons and press Select+Start) if you aren't getting the 2 Mu/1 Levikron fight right after loading the save. Hard resets will always result in a Levikron x3 battle first.

**Mu x2/Levikron**: Have all party members in the back row. Use Grenades or limit breaks to take out the Levikron and one of the Mu quickly. At this point, Cloud is level 8 on my route, meaning that he will get hit by the L4 Suicide, which will make killing him before the end of the battle quick. This battle gave me a lot of trouble. For some reason, the remaining Mu really seemed to like using Sewer on the middle character, where I had Aerith! I moved Aerith into the third slot on another attempt and had no issues. Your experience may vary, of course. Once Aerith has learned L4 Suicide, use it to put the remaining Mu into a critical state, take out Cloud and the other character, and finish the final Mu to get the Enemy Skill retained and XP for Aerith and the inactive party.

With L4 Suicide learned, now it is time to get Chocobuckle. To do that, we'll need the Chocobo Lure materia and a Mimett Green. Go into the Chocobo Ranch barn, speak with Chocobo Billy, and spend the 2000 gil on the materia and then 1500 gil for the Mimett Green. Use Chocobo Bill's "inn" service as well to revive your other party members (100 gil). This is required because Aerith is too slow to throw the Green AND then get L4 Suicide off before the Chocobo runs away. Now save (I used the working file without a backup here) and head back out to the track covered patches of grass. You are looking for the Elphadunk x2/Chocobo formation (they seem to show up more frequently to the northwest of the ranch... not sure if that was just my luck or what though... I didn't see them nearly as much southeast). Elphadunk gives less XP (by 1) than Levikron and are less dangerous overall.

**Elphadunk x2/Chocobo**: Have someone (not Aerith) throw a Mimett Green at the Chocobo and then have Aerith immediately use L4 Suicide right afterword to force the chocobo to use Chocobuckle and run away. Now take out the two Elphadunk with Grenades (making sure Cloud and the other character are dead before winning, of course).

After getting the two Enemy Skills, I made a new save slot (first card: 7/15). Use the save exploit to cross the marsh and enter the Mythril Mine (save before Midgar Zolom contacts you, then soft reset and reload, and continue the trek until you make it). You could also start working on buffing up Chocobuckle, but I would use a location where you can rest for free, such as Under Junon after saving Priscilla. It'll build up over time as well while we run from everything. In any case, make your way through the mine, picking up items on the way, and travel to Junon. You should still have your party of Cloud and another character in the front row and Aerith in the back. Aerith should still have the Carbon Bangle/Mythril Armlet equipped. Equip the Poison materia onto Cloud or the other character (it'll reduce their HP). Save just outside the city (I still used file 7 here). Go back in and fight Bottomswell.

**Bottomswell (2500 HP)**: Have your Bio caster use the spell. It needs to land the poison status on the boss on the first couple of attempts or you may have a bad time with bubbles. It takes 78 HP of damage with every poison tick and take about 30-31 of them to kill it. Aerith should defend while the other two kill themselves (Bottomswell will certainly help out too). Heal Aerith on occasion with her limit break or a Potion before her HP goes down below 60 HP. Let the poison drain Bottomswell's HP until it dies while it never uses it's bubbles or it's Moonstrike attack. Just before it's HP hits 0, make sure Aerith has over 90 HP or it's Final Attack tidal wave will kill you and it and you'll have to try again.

Do CPR and then go to the house near the entrance to rest. You'll be split up from the rest of the team for now so no PHS. Stock up on Grenades at the weapon shop (I'm sure money isn't an issue at this point). Feel free to use this opportunity to build up Chocobuckle as well, if you'd like (make sure to save regularly since it is just Cloud by himself). As a test, I used it when I got to this point and I was only at 84 escapes. Certainly not as much as I thought I had. I figured I was at least over 100 already by this point. Formulas will probably be your biggest pain point as they will take a ton of your health with every encounter. I pushed it up to 200-ish before moving on through the events in Junon. 200 seemed like a good spot since that is stronger than a Grenade.

Use the same strategy used to get **The Imperial March** to get the 5000 gil reward (extra money doesn't hurt). Use the save crystal after putting on the trooper uniform on the working file to try again until you get it, or don't. It's up to you. Pick up the Sources from the fourth and seventh doors along Junon and use the save crystal at the sixth door (Junon Inn). Then do the formation drill minigame to get the Force Stealer weapon and equip it on Cloud and then board the ship.

Once you can form a party, put Aerith and Tifa back in with everyone in the back row. Put your Enemy Skill materia on Aerith so she can use Chocobuckle instead of Grenades if you buffed it up. Feel free to add a Power Wrist accessory to Cloud so that you can do more damage with limit breaks as they happen. Save on the roof of the ship's cabin (first card: 6/10). Make your way down to Jenova BIRTH and use Hyper we got from Don Corneo's bedroom on Aerith just before the battle.

**Jenova BIRTH (4000 HP)**: Grenades, limit breaks, and Chocobuckle for damage. Aerith should be able to maintain health with her limit break because of the Fury status. Stop can mess things up a little, but it shouldn't last too long on a character with a higher battle speed. Once Jenova is within 130 HP or killing range of Chocobuckle, move Cloud and Tifa to the front and take them out, then finish off Jenova. You'll probably unlock Aerith's second limit break by this point if you haven't already.
- **NOTE**: Apparently, Chocobuckle can miss!!

##### The Eastern Continent

In Costa del Sol, get the items from the house for sale and stock up on supplies at the item shop. We want to keep Aerith in Fury status, so either never use an Inn or grab some Hypers from the item shop. Also get a few Softs for for Demons Gate later. When you leave town, swap out Tifa for Barret or Red (it doesn't matter since the next battle is Barret solo, but it's nice to have someone else alive besides Aerith). Equip Aerith with the Steal materia, along with Enemy Skill, and a Fire Ring accessory (Bomb stealing coming up soon). Finally, save your game (first card: 5/15).

Mt. Corel has a bunch of items and equipment to pick up and then Bombs are on the bridge leading into North Corel. Farm Bombs for their Right Arms. Grab as many as you want or are willing to steal. It can take a while to steal. You can let the others die during the grind, as Aerith's Fury is enough to drive healing herself against a lone Bomb. The only issue is the potential for encounters with Cokatolis pincer attacks. If you want to wait until later for getting them, there are Molotovs for sale in North Corel that will be the replacement for Grenades and can supplement the Right Arms you don't steal. I grabbed a Carbon Bangle too for Barret's upcoming fight, though it may not be necessarily needed (I had the money; GarlandG maintains the Bronze Bangle on Barret so it's probably not needed). Also, purchase a bunch of Tranquilizers here as well. Do make sure to have at least 3000 gil left over for the Gold Saucer entrance fee!

- Right Arm farming note: The third battle after a hard reset is a pincer attack with Cokatolis. You then have about eight battles in a row with Bombs before the next Cokatolis pincer battle. Yet another pincer battle is just a few more fights after the previous. Use hard resets to your advantage to cue up a bunch of Bomb battles in a row while saving just before the Cokatolis encounter to game over/soft-reset without losing too many stolen Right Arms.

- Molotov vs. Right Arm: Molotov does fire-elemental damage with 400 base power and can be boosted or reduced based on the target's elemental affinities. Right Arm does non-elemental damage with a base power of 1600. Right Arm is obviously a significant improvement in damage output for a good while and is a worthy investment of time to get. I highly recommend getting at least 7 to 10 of them specifically for Demons Gate. I personally stopped at 30 of them.

After shopping, head out of town to save (working file only should be fine), head up to Gold Saucer, and follow the story events. Feel free to stop by the Ghost Hotel to read Turtle's Paradise Flyer #3 along the way, though we'll have another opportunity later. Once down in Corel Prison, save ASAP so that nothing critical gets stolen by Bandits (first card: 4/15). While at the save crystal, remove Cait's materia, give Cait the Bronze Bangle from Barret and Cloud the Silver Armlet, then head up to Gold Saucer and progress through the story to Corel Prison. This is also a good point to validate Cait's starting XP and update the plan if it isn't 977 XP. Go into the house below the save to get Barret in the party and then head to Dyne.

**Dyne (1200 HP)**: Throw Molotovs (or just one Right Arm if you have excess), using Hi-Potions to heal if necessary. Not too much strategy here.

Follow the story beats. Once on the world map, give Aerith the Silver Armlet you just got and ensure Barret is in the party (if you need to get **Acoustic Fireworks** later). Avoid Gongaga and head straight to Cosmo Canyon.

Pick up the Elixir at the inn (it'll come in use very soon) and read Turtle's Paradise Flyer #5. Head to the weapon shop and read Turtle's Paradise Flyer #4. Make a save on the working file and exploit the conversation with Barret to raise his affinity for getting the **Acoustic Fireworks** achievement later if you need it (first option, second option, leave and re-enter room, repeat x17 or more). Continue with the story, forming a party of Cloud, Red, and Aerith. Save at the weapon shop (first card: 3/15) and then enter the Cave of the Gi.

The cave itself has some items to pick up while in the second and third screens. You can reach the Added Effect materia on the first screen from the second, if you really want to grab it. You should be able to get an Ether, the Black Megaphone, a Fairy Ring, and a Turbo Ether while only facing against one required fight with a Stinger (take the fourth tunnel from the right only at the five tunnels area). The Stinger fights can be skipped but it is tricky to do, so I am opting to do them (and their XP is accounted for in my plan). There will be one more Stinger before reaching Gi Nattak too.

**Stinger (2200 HP)**: Molotovs will cause a counter attack, which can be useful in getting Cloud and Red killed as the Stinger's HP nears zero. While Aerith defends, I had one of the other two use one Right Arm to halve it's health, had Cloud and Red thrown one Molotov each, waited for Cloud and Red to die, and then finished off the Stinger with a Molotov from Aerith.

Between Stinger fights, revive and heal everyone with Phoenix Downs and Potions. After the second Stinger, I only healed up Aerith.

**Gi Nattak (HP doesn't matter)**: Throw an Elixir (ensure Cloud and Red are dead first). The end.

Equip Aerith with the Wizer Staff then get ready for the trek to Nibelheim, picking Tifa and Cait to let them get tank some damage while keeping the Materia Keeper party (besides Cloud) at full health. Apply Tranquilizers to everyone and head out. As soon as Red rejoins, everyone will be fully healed again. Once on the world map, this is another good checkpoint for verifying everyone's XP values are as expected by this point in the plan.

Once in Nibelheim, go pick up all the items in town and in Shinra Manor. It is worth your while to pick up the Destruct materia in the basement for the end of the game. Once everything is cleaned out, sell off equipment and Ethers. Stock up on Hi-Potions and Phoenix Downs.

In Mt. Nibel, pick up the treasures in the area here as well. As you progress, use Potions to heal up as you can, though if characters die, that's not terrible (unless everyone dies... use a Phoenix Down before that happens at least). The first chest has the Rune Blade, which you should equip on Cloud. Once at the pipe room, take Pipe 2, grab the Powersoul, then save (first card: 2/15). We'll get to Materia Keeper in a second, but first we want to go clean up the other treasures before circling back here. Back at the save crystal, use PHS to get Aerith and Barret onto the team and revive Cloud, if necessary. Give everyone Tranquilizers, equip Aerith with the Poison materia (at a minimum), and then save again (I saved over File 2 again for this fight).

**Materia Keeper (8400 HP)**: Trying to get Trine is not possible as it will kill the party. My Aerith and Barret would survive with critical health and Materia Keeper would quickly mop up so it wasn't salvageable. If it didn't open with Trine, everyone needs to defend while Aerith use the Bio spell. You can use a limit break if Barret or Cloud have one ready too. Once the poison status lands on Materia Keeper, leave it alone and let it die from poison (the same strategy we used for the **June Bug** achievement). Let Barret or Cloud do the healing duties while Aerith continues to defend. Be very careful with tossing potions because if you mistarget and throw one at Materia Keeper, that will cause it to enter it's next phase and use Trine/Cure2. As Materia Keeper's health nears zero, ensure Barret and Cloud are dead! If you want to have a bit of control over the end of the fight, a Right Arm does about 1250 HP of damage. You can let Barret and Cloud die as Materia Keeper falls under that 1250 HP threshold, then Aerith can throw a Right Arm to end the fight. Take care with inputs, watch the health tick down, and take control at the end to make this fight go easier.

Save again after the battle! Don't worry about reviving and head to Rocket Town. Once outside of Mt. Nibel, this is a good point to rotate memory cards! We will now be using our second card in slot one to continue archiving saves as we go. Before entering Rocket Town, make a new archived save (second card: 15/15).

In Rocket Town, pick up the items as well as the Yoshiyuki sword from the old man outside the item shop and equip it on Cloud. Push through events until talking to Cid and then head back outside and save. Aerith should be the only one alive still and that is fine, just ensure her HP is topped up and Sadness is still in effect. Palmer is a pushover.

**Palmer (6000 HP)**: He can only use Mako Gun 10 times before he runs out of MP. If the attack happens to be Fire element and you still have the Fire Ring on, that's a free round to attack. Otherwise, heal up with a Hi-Potion after each Mako Gun until he can't attack any more, then kill him with Molotovs or Right Arms. He's slow also, so you may be able to get a Right Arm or Molotov off before he can fire another Mako Gun round. I only had to use one Hi-Potion because he used Fire twice, I got a limit break once, and I was able to act twice between his one attack. The limit break timing may have helped me get more turns in a round too.

##### Gold Saucer again/Temple of the Ancients

GarlandG uses this opportunity to make an initial visit to Wutai in order to purchase some Swift Bolts and Fire Veils with the intention of getting other items from defeating fiends. Two of the items (Lunar and Light Curtains) will not be necessary because we will get Big Guard. They are also used for getting three T/S Bombs from Flapbeats near Gold Saucer for the Icicle fights later. However, we can steal those instead. That's what we are going to do now.

Once you have control of the Tiny Bronco, head east back to the Gold Saucer area. Once you docked, put the Edincoat on Aerith so that she has improved defense. Heal her up as well and find some Flapbeats. We only need three of them, so try to get a T/S Bomb and then run. The Flying Sickle attack will do a lot of damage so if you die or take a lot of damage, consider resetting to a save before the fight and trying again to reduce consumable usage.

Equip Manipulate materia on Aerith and head to a beach area near the Gold Saucer desert. Look for an encounter with three Beachplugs (ideally in a Side Attack so you have initiative). Manipulate one and have it cast Big Guard on Aerith to learn it. Make the manipulated Beachplug Bite itself and then eliminate them with a few of Molotovs. This is also an ideal opportunity to check how far along Chocobuckle is in damage output (I'm at 308 currently by this point).

With the new Enemy Skill and some T/S Bombs, head back to North Corel and save outside. Grind for more Right Arms if needed (Aerith's higher level will make stealing a bit easier, in practice). Once done with that, go back to Gold Saucer. Dead Cloud will wrap up the Battle Square event quickly. Go on the date with whomever had most affinity at this point (Barret in my case, earning **Acoustic Fireworks**). Pick up the Elixir in the hotel room, swap out Barret for Cid when selecting the party, and check Turtle's Paradise Flyer #3. Stock up on more Molotovs, Phoenix Downs, and Hi-Potions (at least 25 of each) and still more Right Arms if you wish. You'll have to go back to Nibelheim to get Hi-Potions. Make sure Cid is in the back row, equip a Silver Armlet on Aerith, and put the Edincoat on Cloud. Now it's time for the Temple of the Ancients.

In the Temple of the Ancients, pick up items as you go. Equip the Trident on Cid when you get it. Make sure to get all of the prizes in the clock room via doors IIII, V, VII, and VIII (do NOT fall down). The Ribbon in particular is of great importance that will be used through the rest of the game. Once you finish the door puzzle room, rest, apply Tranquilizers on the party, equip Princess Guard on Aerith. Equip Poison materia on Aerith or Cid if using the poison strategy. Finally, save your game (second card: 14/15).

**Red Dragon (6800 HP)**: Have Aerith use Big Guard right away, while Cid and Cloud use Right Arms or limit breaks. If you don't have enough Right Arms, cast Bio to land poison status on the boss. Defend with everyone until Red Dragon HP gets down to around 1200 HP, eliminate Cloud and Cid, then throw one more Right Arm to finish the fight. I found the poison strategy to be tougher to manage compared to Materia Keeper. I understand the need for using poison when you don't have Right Arms because Molotovs will heal Red Dragon. Maybe the Big Guard was making things more difficult in that regard though because the party has Haste and the barriers with it. Cid was also in the third character slot and didn't seem to get targeted as much as Aerith was. Swapping them didn't really seem to change things though. I was probably just unlucky. One thing I keep forgetting when it comes time to kill off my characters is that I can use Molotovs/Grenades to do so, rather than physical attacks.

Go back to the sage and rest and save. Return to the mural room to get an encounter and max everyone's limit gauge. This is easier to say than actually do though. Ancient Dragons will rip you apart so look for a Doorbull encounter. Once done, return to the sage. Rest again. Equip Cloud with the Dragon Armlet and Aerith with the Ribbon (we'll get it back when she leaves the party). Save the game again (second card: 13/15).

**Demons Gate (10,000 HP)**: Here we go! This is a big difficulty spike and you need to pay careful attention to the battle and how it swings. Make effective use of the Wait mode for battles (and lower the battle speed if you want) so that you can pace the tossing of Right Arms and react if Demons Gate gets to make a move between character inputs.
If anyone dies in the initial attack by Demons Gate, reset. With all of the characters having a limit break available right away, there is a possibility of interrupting Demons Gate's first attack. If everyone survives, Aerith needs to use Big Guard right after the limit break and first attack by the boss, then the other characters heal up and start throwing Right Arms. With the Haste effect from Big Guard, you should be able to prevent other attacks from Demons Gate by pushing it down 2500 HP and forcing it to take a turn to inch forward in preparation for Demon Rush. If Aerith's health is getting low, heal her with a Hi-Potion. The Demon Rush attack will help to eliminate Cloud and Cid. Be careful near the end as sometimes Demons Gate can get two turns in a row after it resets from the Demon Rush. Use the Wait mode in the Item menu to see if Demons Gate gets two attacks, hopefully finishing off Cid and hitting Aerith for half her health. Throw the final Right Arm to finish the fight and then say farewell to Aerith.

##### The LIFE and Death of Aerith

After the events of the Temple of the Ancients and waking in Gongaga, grab the items in the area, then board the Tiny Bronco and make your way to the Northern Continent. Get the Lunar Harp in Bone Village (you shouldn't need to spend money if you know the exact spot to place a digger). Pick up the Water Ring after you make it through the Sleeping Forest and enter Corral Valley. In the Forgotten City, get all of the items. When you get the Aurora Armlet, equip it on Barret, along with the Ribbon. Take a nap in the building on the eastern side. Head to the center building and descend, equip Cloud with the Water Ring and Gigas Armlet, and then save the game at the save crystal (second card: 12/15). Feel free to have Enemy Skill equipped on Cloud to in order to learn Aqualung. Head down and to the left to fight Jenova LIFE.

**Jenova LIFE (10,000 HP)**: A much easier battle than Demons Gate, thanks to the Water Ring. Just attack with Cloud until everyone dies but him and then win. Feel free to speed things up with Right Arms, but if you are running low, it may be best to save them for more challenging battles later.

#### Disc 2

Cloud just earned a bunch of levels after having been dead for the majority of Disc 1! Rest in the building near where you start Disc 2 and then head north out of Forgotten City. Climb through the cave, collecting the items as you go. Once outside, this is a good moment to verify the party XP is still in line with the plan on the spreadsheet. Save and head to Icicle Inn town.

In town, get the required items needed to progress the story. Feel free to sell off unneeded equipment and restock on Hi-Potions (up to 25 should be enough). Head down the mountain on the snowboard (right then left forks will get you closest to the exit of the next area), and then make your way north in Great Glacier to Holzoff's hut. Rest and form a party of Cloud, Barret, and Cid. Give Barret a Tranquilizer and head up the Northern Crater outer wall.

As you progress through the caves and the climb, keep Barret healed up with Potions, but let Cloud and Cid take the damage and eventually die. After climbing to the first cave, get both items, especially the Ribbon. The next cave is where the fun begins with Icicles! Use the save crystal here (second card: 11/15). Open the chests as you head to the ledge with the Icicles. Hopefully Cloud and Cid are dead before you get to this point. If not, get in a fight with a Malboro so that they can take out Cloud and Cid quickly and Barret will be fine. Now, drop the battle speed to slow (higher battle speeds can result in more accompanying Evilheads getting turns before Barret). Pass by the Icicles and get into a fight with at least three of them, healing up between each fight.

**Icicle**: Just use the T/S Bombs that we stole earlier to drop the Icicle while ignoring the Evilheads and end the battle. That will give you only the XP from the Icicle without the additional XP from the Evilheads.

There is a fourth Icicle that blocks the way to a chest with a Megalixir which you can get by running away from the fight without dropping the Icicle. There is a risk with this though as the Evilheads can wipe you out easily if you fail to run in one round. The choice is yours. I opted NOT to get it because I will be able to duplicate the Megalixir (among other things) later on with W-Item materia. 

- ***NOTE***: I felt that this section was a bit of a pain point. It wasn't very smooth and came down to a lot of luck. There's got to be a better way to do this than how GarlandG proposed. Perhaps setting aside some funds to purchase a Chocobo Feather for the increased speed would be better. Or using Cid instead of Barret. Cid would certainly fit here, XP wise, and he has the highest speed of the three. Barret has A LOT of room for XP buffer though... Using Cid didn't seem to help much. It really depends on luck. This is definitely rough.

After dropping down or circling back around after picking up the Megalixir/dropping the three Icicles, restore your battle speed, switch out Cid to get someone alive without using a Phoenix Down, save again, and proceed up through the center to the third climb. I brought in Red since he's one of the two people for the next fight in my plan.

At the healing water and save crystal, remove the Aurora Armlet from Barret by equipping something low defense and swap Barret out for Tifa. Equip a Bolt Armlet on Cloud and Tifa or Red with the Aurora Armlet and a Fire Ring. Save the game (second card: 10/15).

**Schizo (18,000 HP per head)**: The idea here is to let Schizo's heads burn down their 350 MP by doing breath attacks before doing anything. This is because Schizo will counter with Tremor if it has MP every five attacks. I thought I would be tricky and try to steal the Protect Ring from the right head while waiting for it to burn out it's MP from the breath attacks. However, that just resulted in Schizo doing it's Tremor counter attack when five Steals were attempted. So, do nothing, waiting for the "skill power is used up" message. That will take quite a while (10 MP per breath attack with 350 MP per head). Thank goodness for fast forward! Once that is done, revive Cloud and move him to the front, kill off the character with the Aurora Armlet/Fire Ring, and attack the heads until it dies. But why Cloud? Because each head has a Lightning based Final Attack so Cloud with the Bolt Armlet will survive that attack. You could certainly switch around which character survives and gets the XP, but Cloud should be able to attack the heads for a decent amount of damage compared to other characters at this point. Also, using Right Arms is a bit overkill since this setup removes all threat of this boss. Just use Attack with fast forward to get through it quickly.

According to GarlandG, there is a bug with the passage that Schizo is in where the encounters that can now appear in there are unrunnable so avoid backtracking to the save crystal and head on to the summit of the crater. A new save spot is coming up fairly soon and Cloud should be fully healed from the Lightning attacks.

Save at the save crystal (second card: 9/15). There is a few screens until the boss fight unfortunately so take care crossing the whirlwind. Getting into a fight by hitting the whirlwind is unrunnable and will require a reset. Once you get past the second whirlwind, equip Cloud with the worst armor you have and a Fire Ring.

**Jenova DEATH (25,000 HP)**: Move Cloud to the front row. Cloud can't be hurt because of the Fire Ring (he's going away and we want the armor for other characters). Attack until it dies. The end.

Save at the next save point (I just used the working file for this one). There is still one more windy section to cross before reaching the moment when Cloud is lost to us for a while. Get past that then after the cutscenes we'll be in Junon.

During the escape from Junon, when Barret and Cait Sith are teamed up, a forced battle with 2 Attack Squad enemies takes place, but it is a runnable encounter. After Junon and gathering on the Highwind, head to Mideel and initiate the events there. With Cid in charge, form a party with Red and Cait then fly off to Fort Condor. During the battle, we aren't getting the Huge Materia, so let the forces reach the shack and then let the party die to the CMD. Grand Horn. Everyone is revived with 1 HP. Heal up Cid only then head to North Corel. We're going to fail that Huge Materia mission as well. Take the train tracks back to the reactor. Use the save point on the way (second card: 8/15). Let Red and Cait die on the way and then fight two Attack Squad.

**Attack Squad x2**: One Right Arm should take them both out in one shot. Cid should be the only one alive by this point with the random encounters on the way here so that makes this less complicated.

After that, you'll begin to chase the Huge Materia train. Let the timer run out as soon as it appears so that we don't fight the forced encounters. Once that's over, if you need to farm more Right Arms, this is the perfect time to do so before we get Cloud and Tifa back.

Back at Mideel, prepare for the upcoming fight with Ultimate Weapon. Head inside Mideel and pick up an Elixir from the house on the left near where Tifa met the dog, then go back out to the world map. Equip the Enemy Skill materia and a Reflect Ring, and then use a Tranquilizer on Cid. Save the game (second card: 7/15). Head back in and go see Tifa and Cloud.

**Ultimate Weapon**: This is a fight that isn't going to give XP. Just survive three rounds. Ultimate Weapon starts with Quake2, which gets reflected with the Reflect Ring. Use this time to put up Big Guard. Use a Hi-Potion next to heal after Ultimate Weapon's physical attack. Now, Ultima Beam will do about 650 HP of damage so as long as your HP is over that, you'll survive and the Weapon runs away.

Help Cloud regain his true self then form a party of Cloud, Tifa, and Red. This is also a great moment to verify that your XP plan is still on track on the spreadsheet. Equip the three characters with the elemental armors (Bolt, Aurora, Fire Armlets). Ensure any Ribbons are off previous party members and give them the weakest armor available as we'll need them for the current party.

We now need to prep for the Junon Underwater Reactor battles. Swift Bolts will help with the Carry Armor battle. Right Arms are always handy for multi-target 1600 base damage. S-mines are also available which does the same damage as Right Arms but are single target. There are nine fights, including Carry Armor. Most of the fights are Submarine Crew and Underwater MP with multiple enemies per battle, so Right Arms are ideal for smooth sailing and should take out most enemies with one Right Arm and one Grenade/Molotov per enemy per fight. You'll need more Right Arms or S-mines for Carry Armor after the arms are destroyed (15 according to GarlandG). If you need money for these purchases, sell off Ethers, weapons, armor (except the Dragon and Gigas Armlets), and accessories (except Ribbons and Water/Fire/Poison Rings). So either steal enough Right Arms for Carry Armor, or purchase at least 15 S-mines (1000 gil each) from Costa del Sol. Go to Wutai to pick up at least 11 Swift Bolts (800 gil each). Stock up on Hi-Potions and Phoenix Downs (top back up to 25 each). Get more Tranquilizers too, if you need them. You can also pick up the weapons in Wutai while here to sell for more cash, if in desperate need.

Once prepared, head to Junon and save before entering (second card: 6/15). Use a Tranquilizer on Cloud and put Tifa/Red in the front row (if they are still alive). Head to the center of Junon where you can head down toward the underwater reactor passage/elevator. Time to fight!

**Submarine Crew x2**: A Right Arm is not quite enough to take out a Submarine Crew enemy, unfortunately. Once one was thrown, I used the leftover Grenades to finish the job once Tifa and Red were dead.

Heal up before leaving the elevator. Exit and fight again!

**Submarine Crew x2**: Repeat what you did previously, though Red/Tifa should still be dead this time.

- ***NOTE***: It is at this point that Cloud hit level 20 in my route. If you intend to get Yuffie, like I am for this playthrough, Cloud needs to remain dead for all remaining fights until you get her.

Heal up Cloud and continue to the next save crystal. Remove Red's elemental armor, swap out Red for Barret, and put that armor on him. Put Cloud in the front row and use a Tranquilizer on Barret. Save the game (second card: 5/15). Continue down the next elevator to the underwater tunnel to the reactor. You may get into fights here or not. Take another elevator down. Cross the catwalk over the sub docks to another save crystal (I used the same file) and beyond to get to our next fight, this time with a single Submarine Crew. You want to fight this one alone because if you pass them, all three enemies will pincer attack you.

**Submarine Crew**: Now we need Cloud to die if he didn't on the way to this fight. Since there is only one enemy, I used an S-mine while Cloud tries to take himself out and then threw a Grenade to win.

Head to the next two.

**Submarine Crew x2**: Repeat the previous strategy with a Submarine Crew pair.

After the battle, feel free to backtrack to the save crystal to update your working file. Head back and you'll encounter your first pair of Underwater MPs.

**Underwater MP x2**: GarlandG recommended reviving Cloud and Tifa without healing because Underwater MPs tend to get three attacks in a row. If turn order doesn't work out, this could take out Barret. However, we have Right Arms, which can take these dudes out in one shot! So, Barret should be able to survive even if both MPs get a turn before Barret and then he can take them out after that. Saving beforehand allows you to quickly try again with hopefully better luck.

Press forward to see the cutscenes of the Huge Materia get taken away and then put into the sub, where Reno is waiting for you. After seeing that (don't walk forward or you'll trigger the Carry Armor fight!), run back to the save crystal again. Remove the elemental armors from Tifa and Barret, swap in Cid and Cait Sith, and put those armors on them. Revive and heal everyone, use Tranquilizers on everyone, lower the battle speed, and save one more time (second card: 4/15). Head back and bring the fight to Carry Armor!

**Carry Armor (24,000 HP body/10,000 HP per arm)**: This is the hardest fight in the challenge at this point. Get Big Guard up right away! If Carry Armor gets a Lapis Laser off before Big Guard, that's a reset (this can happen a LOT). The extra defense is awesome and the Haste makes this even easier. Use Swift Bolts to take out the arms. With Haste, you will probably be able to take out the arms before anyone can get grabbed. If someone gets grabbed, the only way they'll get let go is by dying. That's fine though because we will eventually want Cloud and Cait to die. If Cid gets grabbed, destroy the arms and then revive him. My experience was that no one was grabbed. Hopefully that is the same for you. Once the arms are gone, the threat is greatly minimized. Keep track of HP and get it down with S-mines until in range of one. Lapis Laser will do a ton of damage, probably putting everyone at critical HP. If you still have a ways to go to get Carry Armor's HP down, make use of a Megalixir. If Carry Armor gets another Lapis Laser off (hopefully your barriers are still up), only heal Cid with Hi-Potions and let the other two die. Lapis Laser has a greater chance of being used as Carry Armor nears death so timing will be crucial at the end to ensuring fellow party members die while Cid remains. Ensure that Cid is the last person standing and then toss the last S-mine for sweet victory! This took me about 11 or 12 tries (I ended up losing count) to win. Most of them were due to round one wipes, but I had about four make it to the end and just couldn't get the timing right and Cid would die to a Lapis Laser. Be patient and a win will come eventually.

No saving allowed after the fight because you need to get on that sub! Heal up Cid and get ready to fight three groups of Submarine Crew before you can save (perhaps transfer over any materia Cloud had to Cid). Pick up the Battle Trumpet and Scimitar and equip them on Cait and Cid. One thing to note though: the last battle of Submarine Crew is a pincer battle. This can be risky for just Cid to survive, and he probably wouldn't. So, we'll need to have Cait alive at the start of that battle. The wrinkle here is that there is no menuing between the second and third battle! This means that both Cid and Cait need to be alive for the second battle. Then Cait can die during the third.

**Submarine Crew x2**: First of three! As before, one Right Arm and then Grenades for each enemy to finish.

Revive Cait and fully heal and Tranquilizer him. Start the next fight!

**Submarine Crew x2**: Second of three! Same as before. Don't bother healing.

**Submarine Crew x3**: It's a pincer attack so you'll have no ATB at the start. If someone dies, press on. Use the Dragon Fang we got from Schizo to kill the group of two. Now, if Cid died, revive him and heal him, or just heal him if his HP is low. Let Cait die if not already, the finish off the solitary enemy with an S-mine and Grenade/physical attack.

Congrats if you made it here! Save your game (second card: 3/15). Take the bridge crew prisoner and then win the submarine minigame. While in the sub, go ahead and retrieve the Key of the Ancients now. Return to shore. Equip Tifa with the God's Hand weapon (so we don't sell it), then form the next party for Rocket Town: Cloud, Cid, and Red. Cloud can stay dead and Red should still be down as well. Put a Ribbon on Cid. Now is a good time to put your battle speed back where you had it. Heal Cid fully and go to Rocket Town. Go to the item shop and sell off any weapons and Shinra Betas. Open the chests in the item and weapon shops. Restock on Hi-Potions and then save outside (you can use the same archive file of 3/15). Head for the rocket and let the battles begin.

**Attack Squad x2**: First of three! We've seen them before and one Right Arm does the job.

**Attack Squad x2**: Second of three! Right Arm again!

**Attack Squad x2/Senior Grunt**: Third of three! Right Arm again to deal with the two Attack Squad enemies. The Senior Grunt should die with one more S-mine. If you need, heal between the two attacks.

You can't head back and save but Cid probably won't survive the next fight alone. Thankfully, we have the opportunity to heal up here. Revive and heal Cloud and Red. Put the other Ribbon on Cloud. Equip a Sense materia or prepare to start counting damage manually! Head up the ladder and fight!

**Turks: Rude (9000 HP)/Attack Squad x2**: Kick things off with a Right Arm again. Unfortunately, the Select+R1 HP counter doesn't work for this fight so either use Sense or count the damage especially since he can cure himself with Cure2 when his HP gets low. The toughest part of this fight will probably be ensuring Cloud and Red are dead before Rude dies and Rude not killing Cid. Rude will probably end up running out of MP during the fight as well, if he keeps healing himself and using Bolt2. Do you feel lucky? You could try to steal Ziedrich from Rude while you're here, but that's probably not likely.

Heal Cid again! One more battle to go inside of the rocket.

**Senior Grunt**: Just throw two S-mines and your done. If you have run out of S-mines by this point (enemies have been dropping them unless you've been really unlucky), just attack. Cid should be pretty strong at this point to handle a one-on-one with this dude.

Follow the story beats (the code for unlocking the Huge Materia again is Circle Square X X if you want to get it). Pick up Cid's ultimate weapon from the old man outside the item shop. Before returning to the Forgotten City with the Key of the Ancients, go pick up more Swift Bolts from Wutai. We'll need at least 40 of them (money should be good at this point but sell some stuff if needed). This will cover the remaining boss fights of Disc 2. Now go recruit Yuffie with Cid (Cloud and Red should still be dead).

**Mystery Ninja**: The ninja should die very easily with a limit break or a couple physical attacks. Do the "minigame" to recruit Yuffie by giving the proper responses and not going into your menu.

Verify Yuffie's starting XP and update the plan if it is different (this would only happen if Cloud's level was higher than 20 though). Turn in the Key of the Ancients. Before going back into the Highwind, it's time to make another save (second card: 2/15). Fly to the northern coast of Midgar. Revive Cloud. Bring in Barret for Red. Equip Cloud with a Fire Armlet, Barret with a Fire Ring, and Cid with Dragon Armlet. Put Enemy Skill materia on Cloud. Save just before Diamond Weapon gets close and then fight.

**Diamond Weapon (30,000 HP)**: Big Guard is a big help here. It's not mandatory, but it can help to minimize the damage that Diamond Weapon's foot stomp attack does. The biggest aid is the Haste from Big Guard as it persists through the rest of the battle. Whenever a character can take action, open up the item menu and wait for the previous character's action and Diamond Weapon's response. Are they stomping? Heal the character stomped! Not stomping? Throw a Swift Bolt. Alternate between keeping health up on all characters, especially Cid and Barret's HP higher than Cloud's because the foot stomp always targets the highest HP character. Cloud may survive a foot stomp, but it'll be very close unless Big Guard barriers are active. Cloud will probably only have two casts of the spell too so keeping the item menu open as soon as it's available will be helpful in maintaining barriers as long as possible. Swift Bolt does about 1150-1220 HP of damage. Once Diamond Weapon is within 1100 HP or so remaining, move Cid and Barret to the front and let them die or kill them off, then Cloud throws the last Swift Bolt to win.

Congrats! You only have one more boss battle to worry about in order to meet the level requirements for the achievement! Once Diamond Weapon is dead and the cutscenes have played out, land the Highwind to prepare the party for the Hojo fight because we are going to do the Midgar Raid skip! This is the best time to double check that your XP plan is still on track as well. Diamond Weapon just gave a ton of XP and you want to make sure it only went to Cloud and the inactive party members.

Set up your memory card files to have a new card and save prior to the preparations, just in case (third card: 15/15). Head to Costa del Sol and buy more S-mines (we need at least 50). Stock up on Hi-Potions as well. Money shouldn't be an issue after that fight with the Weapon.
For the party, bring in Yuffie and Cait Sith. Equip Cloud with the Gigas Armlet and Power Wrist. For Yuffie, put on the Fourth Bracelet and a Ribbon. Cait will wear the Dragon Armlet and other Ribbon. Use Tranquilizers on everyone. Save again (third card: 14/15).

To do the Midgar Raid skip, head to Northern Crater after defeating Diamond Weapon. While the cutscene plays where Reeve is talking to Hojo on his phone, hold down, right, and X on the controller. While Hojo on Sister Ray comes into view, continue to hold down those buttons. An invisible Cloud will be running toward Hojo as the scene loads. If done properly, you'll see your party hop out from the invisible Cloud who tells Hojo to "Stop right there!!" The battle with Hojo will then start without having to skydive into Midgar. Note that music will be glitched during this battle as a result.

**Hojo (13,000 HP)**: Put up a Big Guard right away to get Haste. Give Cloud the Vaccine after that so he has Ribbon benefits for the rest of the fight (don't let him die until near the end though!). Chuck S-mines at Hojo. When within 1 S-mine remaining, heal up before throwing the last one and starting the next phase.

**Hellectic Hojo (26,000 HP)/Left Arm (24,000 HP)/Right Arm (5000 HP)**: Hojo's Right Arm is the primary target. Use our Right Arm items to kill the arm while damaging the other arm at the same time, hopefully before it kills anyone else. Yuffie has the highest potential to die here. Let her die if it does happen and just get that Right Arm out of the picture. Once it is down, heal up (perhaps a Megalixir is warranted here? Just don't use the last one!). Now focus on the Left Arm. Switch back to Right Arm items if Hojo's Right Arm respawns. Once Hojo is dead, it's on to the final phase.

**Lifeform-Hojo NA (30,000 HP)**: Bring up the Select+R1 HP counter. Throw S-mines and heal as necessary. Take it slow and steady, making use of the item menu to pause time and react to what Hojo does. Yuffie needs to be the last one alive before the killing blow. Because of Yuffie's low HP, there is a process to follow that makes the end of the battle easier (GarlandG's recommendation): When Hojo has less than 2300 HP left, Yuffie throws S-mine at Cloud, Cait throws one at Hojo. Hojo attacks Cait Sith. Cait throws S-mine at himself and Yuffie throws one at Hojo to win.

Well done! At this point, if no one is over level 28, the plan was a success! We still have the final dungeon and battle to come, of course, but no more experience will be gained. After the scenes, save the game when prompted (third card: 13/15). On to Disc 3!

#### Northern Crater Preparation

At this point, you could use this time to grind up escapes for Chocobuckle to greatly increase your attack power. Another option is to head to Bone Village and pick up the W-Item materia to duplicate our consumable items, especially the attack items, Elixirs, and Megalixirs. With either of these, the rest of this challenge should be pretty simple. You could make this harder on yourself if you'd rather not use these tricks, but you have come this far, completing all other achievements and following through with the plan to keep at or below level 28 for **David and Goliath**. However you wish to play the finale, I think you deserve a victory lap making it this far.

If you opt to go the more difficult route, you will probably have wanted to do the dive into Midgar Raid to get all of the items there, and perhaps the Wutai side quest before hand. Midgar in particular has fantastic armor and weapons that will help for improving survivability for the final boss gauntlet. Having a Mystile and Aegis Armlet could be huge! Additionally, if not using W-Item duplication AND skipping Midgar, you'll have to use the Mover fight to get the remaining funds to purchase the needed items. Using GarlandG's guide, they did two Mover fights for 180,000 gil which was enough to supplement the costs for all of the attack and healing items (selling some equipment too or an additional Mover fight). They bought 99 S-mines, 75 Swift Bolts, 50 Hi-Potions, 50 Phoenix Downs, and 25 Tranquilizers. One thing to caution about farming Movers: there is an encounter two Allemagnes in a pincer that you can't escape from. So you'll want to place your Save Crystal close to the swamp and use it frequently.

Before making the final descent down the crater, head to the Sunken Gelnika. There's a ton of great weapons there that's well worth the risk to get. Just heal up between fights and make good use of the save crystal while gathering the items. Note that if you do use the Midgar Raid skip, Reno and Rude will still be in the second half of the Gelnika so you may not be able to get everything if you did the skip and don't have the room to take any more XP. That's not too bad though, since Yuffie's ultimate weapon is in the first half as well as Cloud's Heaven's Cloud sword.

With preparations complete, select your party and back row/Tranquilizer everyone. I recommend making one more archive save (third card: 12/15). This will be there to fall back on if something bad happens with your dive into the crater.

Once you are ready, head down the crater to the center, picking up items along the way (especially the Save Crystal item). When you get to the split paths, the characters that you send to certain directions give you items based on where you sent them when you meet at the bottom. There is a good table with the character and paths at [jegged.com's Northern Cave guide](https://jegged.com/Games/Final-Fantasy-VII/Walkthrough/Disc-3/39-Northern-Cave.html), which I'm copying here:

| Character | Right         | Left-Upper      | Left-Lower    |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Barret    | Guard Source* | Vaccine         | Remedy        |
| Cait Sith | Elixir        | Remedy          | X-Potion      |
| Cid       | Speed Source* | Imperial Guard* | Elixir        |
| Red XIII  | Mind Source   | Shield Materia  | Speed Source* |
| Tifa      | Mystile*      | Hero Drink      | Turbo Ether   |
| Yuffie    | Megalixir     | Counter materia | Vaccine*      |

The starred items are items to potentially target getting. Vaccines will be helpful for the very last fight to avoid status effects on your non-Ribbon character (though they won't get Big Guard effects either). Mystile is a must! The Sources are great for final boss rush prep. You can also opt for the Imperial Guard to add more defense to another character. The consumable items such as Remedy, Hero Drink, Vaccine, etc could all be useful if you want to do duplication of them but you probably already have them.

Use the chart to plan your path down, or risk it and do the chest duplication trick from the normal run. Cloud took the left-lower path and sent Barret and Tifa right and then sent Cid and Yuffie left-upper, bringing Cait and Red with Cloud. The main goals of this being wanting to get the armors over everything else while I can pick up the Vaccine and Speed Source myself. I already had a Hero Drink from earlier so I didn't need to get another one (I also don't think there is any time to even use them).

Once everyone is gathered at the bottom and items are collected, let's mosey! Pick your two strongest party members to join Cloud (for me that was Yuffie and Cid). Equip the strongest weapons you have at this point. Equip Cloud with Mystile, Yuffie with Imperial Guard, and Cid with Fourth Bracelet/Escort Guard. Give Yuffie and Cloud the Ribbons, and Cid something else? If you got the Tetra Elemental from the right path, you can give that to him. Otherwise, find the next best thing. Give Cloud all of the Sources. For materia distribution, I gave Cloud the most with Enemy Skill, Luck Plus, Long Range, Double Cut, Counter Attack and W-Item. I gave Yuffie the Destruct materia for the very last battle.

Descend to the center. Run from the encounters that can happen and heal/reapply Tranquilizers if needed after every escape. Near the bottom, make sure the team is fully healed.

#### Final Battles

**Jenova SYNTHESIS (60,000 HP)**: This fight gives you XP only IF you defeat the boss before it can cast Ultima. So yeah, that means that you have to be able to survive an Ultima. That's what the Mystile will help you with. If you got more than one, that's greater opportunity for Ultima to miss at least one of the characters. Luck will play a big part here. In order to get to that point, use Big Guard right away for the Haste benefit. Use Right Arms or Swift Bolts to hit all targets. Use limit breaks as they happen. When both arms are down, switch to S-mines to save on Right Arms/Swift Bolts, then swap back when arms are revived. If your non-Ribbon character gets poisoned, use a Remedy or let them die and bring them back. When the Ultima countdown starts, stop throwing items. Pray your Mystile character(s) evade it. The end.

Get your gang back together for the next battle and fully heal those who died. Good luck with the rest!

**Bizzaro-Sephiroth (40,000 HP body/10,000 HP core, 4000 HP arms, 2000 HP head)**: Again, start off with Big Guard. The problem is Stigma, which will happen every four turns if the head and core are both alive. Start throwing Right Arms/Swift Bolts to take down the head quickly and the arms shortly after. Three S-mines/Swift Bolts/Right Arms are needed to take out the head (the boss's defense is high enough to reduce the damage output significantly). Knock out the arms next (five of our damage dealing items to do so), then the core. Of course, heal up as necessary. Once the parts are down and the body is all that's left, S-mine it. Take out the head when it revives as necessary. Heartless Angel? Respond with Megalixir. Take it slowly, use the item menu to see if Bizzaro reacts to anything before taking action and responding with healing as needed. The beginning of the battle is the scariest part but once you can get parts eliminated and keep the team alive/revived by whatever means necessary, you'll come out on top.

**Safer-Sephiroth (80,000-ish HP)**: Time to go all out. The boss follows a tight script for all of their actions. Be aggressive in keeping your party healed/revived/guarded as much as possible and as with the others, make use of the item menu to reduce barrier decay speed while being able to react to Safer's actions between character turns. Use limit breaks as they are available, especially if Safer's barrier is down. A limit break can have the damage output improved with a Hero Drink too. Safer's physical Wing attack is like Diamond Weapon, always targeting the highest HP character and seems not to be dodgeable. Megalixir after Heartless Angel and Super Nova. Heartless Angel will only occur after Safer is less than 20,000 HP, replacing Break in the attack order. After DeSpell will be Deen. You absolutely need barriers and/or Sadness with Tranquilizers and at least 800 HP for that or you will die. So, Megalixir or other healing items if only one character is below 1100 HP and Big Guard. Slow and steady. Breathe. You've come this far.

- ***NOTE***: This was VERY slow and took a long time to defeat Safer-Sephiroth. There are a lot of things that could have made this easier such as getting more Mystile armor, going to Midgar, improving Chocobuckle, better setup of materia and equipment, and so on. Truly stressful doing it this way and I was worried that I wasn't going to survive on my first attempt. Thankfully, I managed to pull through!

Congrats! As Safer-Sephiroth explodes, Cloud descends one more time to finally end Sephiroth and release Holy. Once the final strike hits, at long last, the **David and Goliath** achievement unlocks.
