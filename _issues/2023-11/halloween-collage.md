Did you all have a great Halloween? For RetroAchievements this year, {% rauserpic ZeeRA %} and the events team brings you [a unique event](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=24016) to celebrate this yearly spooky festivity! Players could choose from a total of 13 spooky games to play, earning a point for each that would reward them with one of three tiered badges depending on their progress. Furthermore, users could participate in one of three distractions for additional points! Providing tips on an achievements was one, with writing a Play This Set another (which you can read in this RANews Issue as well!). The final distraction was fan-art, which we are happy to showcase today!

<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic Chauckles %}</div>

{% rauser Chauckles %} may have lost their mind with the Mario hack, it was worth it because they have produced this masterpiece:

<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic MysticCoffee %}</div>

Somehow, something happened to {% rauser MysticCoffee %}'s version of [Scooby-Doo! Classic Creep Capers (Game Boy Color)](https://retroachievements.org/game/1351), horrifyingly causing Velma to turn evil?! They provide this chilling evidence:

{% rauser JustAnotherPoppet %} has been searching Atari's [Haunted House (Atari 2600)](https://retroachievements.org/game/16348) and has been inspired to share the following:

{% rauser MatheusBrazuca85 %} draws on [William Afton](https://fivenightsatfreddys.fandom.com/wiki/William_Afton) for inspiration after spending 5 nights at Freddy's, I'd never be brave enough for that!

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/4daa2bf5-aefc-4f33-84fd-4d21405022ad)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic austin8259 %}</div>

The pages from [Slender's 8 Pages](https://retroachievements.org/game/24124) continue to make their creepy way into the world as {% rauser austin8259 %} has found in his [Denial](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/310839) fan-art:

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/105e84e5-f910-4153-819e-874d6612116e)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic GreninjaMan %}</div>

We love crossovers here at RA and {% rauser GreninjaMan %}'s crossover of Slenderman in FNAF2 paints a picture of a world filled with genuinely horrifying pizzerias. We love it

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/8c7e3443-c4c6-4278-b6b0-ab4fe48f2378)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic StingX2 %}</div>

One of our longest serving veterans of RA {% rauser StingX2 %} has provided this very relatable fan-art of Slenderman in dire need of a satnav:

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/48875b05-8e8d-48b1-bc75-04906dc1670d)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic Triforce %}</div>

{% rauser Triforce %} shares a very familiar moment playing [Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The (Atari 2600)](https://retroachievements.org/game/13093), being spine-chillingly judged by a feline friend:

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/edc842e7-2f26-4626-ba03-af78c16bf99f)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic Shroomer %}</div>

{% rauser Shroomer %} brings us a real nightmare before Christmas in this high-quality chilling rendition of Oogie Boogie getting his just desserts:

<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic VenHur %}</div>

{% rauser VenHur %} has produced the ultimate mash-up of all the games they mastered! This one is my favourite as they look like they're having a Halloween party üéÉüéâ

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/9224065d-09fa-4009-8697-b33a49679beb)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic Akai %}</div>

After tackling the frustrating [Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The (Atari 2600)](https://retroachievements.org/game/13093), {% rauser  %} produced a brilliant interpretation inspired by the game-over screen:

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/fc9e60ec-4d5f-47e0-8d9a-99ebae601202)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic Mendil %}</div>

{% rauser Mendil %} provides Jack Skellington's lament, masterfully underscored by Oogie Boogie's outline: So much games, So much to achieve, So little time...

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/8bf12f75-75ad-4de4-b29c-05b7617a4a8b)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic Pikacshu %}</div>

{% rauser Pikacshu %} captures a (beautifully drawn) fairly horrifying moment of realisation... [Slenderman has tentacles?!?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slender_Man#:~:text=He%20is%20most%20commonly%20described,to%20anyone%20who%20sees%20it.)

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/315c25f4-c58f-4fd4-98fb-ae36a1c0118f)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic TheJediSonic %}</div>

Another of my favourites, {% rauser TheJediSonic %} has carefully and masterfully put together a huge gathering of all the Halloween characters at the spooky afterparty. Wish I could be there

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/1ff33fcf-4a2e-456a-b5cd-191ebed066bf)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic WarioFan63 %}</div>

{% rauser WarioFan63 %} shares another very relatable moment of that final few seconds before mastering [Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The (Atari 2600)](https://retroachievements.org/game/13093) - the final victim chase for that 30000 points:

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/0c477c4b-a142-451e-aced-c8103b27ee4f)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic Zyndeyqualarrin %}</div>

{% rauser Zyndeyqualarrin %}'s stunning ink render of Slenderman evokes a unique terror really making my blood run cold... 

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/da534eee-9018-4db0-9053-ec9978c008ec)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic DeviMetric %}</div>

I love this [Super Mario 64: Halloween Mayhem](https://retroachievements.org/game/11437) fan-art, it's so well-drawn and perfectly captures Mario's dread, I want to see more of {% rauser DeviMetric %}'s skills!

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/fa61aca6-1654-4f29-ba0b-c30a459e20ae)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic ChveuluTheReal %}</div>

Incorporating the skull motif üíÄ {% rauser ChveuluTheReal %} shares with us each of their completions in a terrifying victim line-up. I especially love Scooby and how you've actually brought some of these (Atari 2600 games) forward into 16-bit. Very high quality:

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/31804286-b087-4453-bef5-0d723f430a66)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic abdalin %}</div>

{% rauser abdalin %} brings us a really clever fan-art showing Pumpkin King/Jack Skellington's alter-ego. I love the shading, clearly shows off care and attention that's gone into it:

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/25626b17-1033-4d3d-b971-3c91d836b857)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic Poefred %}</div>

{% rauser Poefred %} shares a touch of Halloweenish expressionism with a disguised/hidden Slenderman creeping on the side. Love it:

<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic Thigos %}</div>

Zoinks! After mastering 2 Scooby-Doo titles for the event, {% rauser Thigos %} has created a high-quality visage of Shaggy, I can almost hear him saying "Uh, Scoobs?!"

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RANews/assets/36479414/9f12ea62-fee9-4162-8b3f-784dc06e3547)


<div class="bingo-winner-small">{% rauserpic shingo3 %}</div>
