## Intro

We often look to the leaderboard to see who has the most points, and those gamers work very hard to be the best. Some live, eat, and breathe fire for achievements and their quest for MORE POINTS. I wanted to take a look at a different approach to the best gamers on this site. Some of our best gamers are mastery chasers, and some even stay on one particular system.

I am proud to bring you the full list of Top Mastery! These systems all have 25+ sets, with exceptions of PKMN Mini and Virtual Boy which have tiny libraries. We will host those two systems until the Top 25 is locked in at which point both of those systems will be retired to the Mastery Hall of Fame. 

So Without further ado I present the first real edition of Top Mastery and your champions, give it up to these users they worked their butts off to prove that points are one side of this story, Masteries are the other side.
