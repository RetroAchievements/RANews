## May's Spot the Difference Winner

## Spot the Difference

Yoshi's Island is a peaceful and lovely place and the homeland of the Yoshis. One day Baby Bowser stole the Super Happy Tree destroying the peace and while he did, he changed 10 things in the world too. Can you find all the differences in the right picture?

**Note:** The first user who finds the 10 differences and sends proof to {% rauser SporyTike %} via Site DM or Discord will be listed in the next issue as the winner and can decide the game of the next picture.
