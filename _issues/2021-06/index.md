### Play This Set

Community members talking about their favorite sets and why you should play them. Cool stuff!


### Retro Throwback

We're starting a new segment in this issue: Retro Throwback. It's where players can show their passion for the games they actually played in the old days. We can think about it as "a longer play-this-set article" but with a bigger load of nostalgia.
