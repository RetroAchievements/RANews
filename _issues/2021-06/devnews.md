## Intro

In many ways, 2021 has been the year of Quality Assurance and the year of Revisions. Although being worked toward for a long time, back in April we revealed the QA Team which has become the fourth pillar in how we run things.

The focus of the QA Team is development compliance and working with developers. Under this branch falls: Code Reviewers, Writing, Hash-Links, RA Patch Project, Site Cleanup, Tickets Cleanup and more!

What I'm here to talk about today is a brand new way of handling Developer Events, DevQuest!  

## FAQ

### What is DevQuest?

We are changing the way we do Developer events by not having limited time events anymore. Things such as Devember, Great-Jacko, are gone. Previous time-constrained developer events have caused them to lose participants and die-out fairly quickly. We still want to award developers with their hard work, but on their own time and contributions. 

In place of timed events, we will have QUESTS that act like an MMO. These quests do not have a time limit, and by completing each one you earn a site badge. You can start a quest today, one week later, or even three months later: they will still be there for you! 


### How do I mark my progress?

A document will be created for you to fill out as a participant. Upon completion of a quest, a member of the QA-Team will verify that you have completed the quest requirements, and you will be awarded the site badge for it. 

### When will new quests be created?

New quests will be added when deemed necessary by QA-Team, You will probably get a ping/notification when this is done.

### Is Anything retroactive?

Except Vet Dev time and work you put in, no. The goal of developer events even at their core was to help clean the site.

### Can we suggest quests?

DM a QA team member the idea and we will discuss it in QA Team
