## 0) Author Information

Hello there, I'm Nepiki! I'm a gamer who has an unofficial case of amnesia so I have an obsession with writing everything down so I don't forget about it! Joking aside, I do genuinely like writing, especially if it helps out other people. I don't have a lot of guides yet, but expect to see more pop up in the future!

For everything me related, here are some links you can check out:

## 2) Introduction

Bomberman Quest is an action-adventure game. The player takes the role of Bomberman, who has to defeat monsters and collect items to defeat the four bosses of each area. Unlike most Bomberman games, this one is an action-adventure game in which Bomberman can freely roam across the map. 

This set has a total of 40 achievements worth 350 points, and was created by [Kayesay](https://retroachievements.org/User/Kayesay). A pretty solid set overall, not really a big fan of the no-damage bosses but that's mostly because it can take ages to reach the boss again after a failed attempt, which may happen frequently due to their very offensive moveset. Especially the final boss who tanks the Gameboy Colour's framerate, what a b*tch.

## 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story/Bosses Achievements**](#step-1-storybosses-achievements--total-points-97)

All of these achievements are either unlocked through the story, or can be obtained at any given time. Some bosses are optional, but I've listed them in this section as well.

[**Step 2: No-damage Bosses (7 missable)**](#step-2-no-damage-bosses-7-missable--total-points-95)

The achievements for defeating all the bosses without taking damage. All aside from the very final boss are missable, as the bosses do not return once you defeat them.
**note: Due to me umm, not being that good at no-damage bosses, I was unable to defeat 5 of the 8 bosses without taking damage. Therefore, I can only give hints and tricks, but there are probably other people who can help better. Apologies in advance.**

[**Step 3: Miscellaneous Achievements (6 missable)**](#step-3-miscellaneous-achievements-6-missable--total-points-158)

All sorts of miscellaneous achievements, ranging from bomb creation to completion of the map. There are 6 missable achievements, and it is important that you read this because you could potentially end up being unable to complete the game:

- [Hot Potato [m] (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102928) - Bomb Component + Clock
- [Where's the Boom? [m] (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102929) - Bomb Component + Clock
- [Dextrality [m] (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102932) Bomb Component + Boomerang
- [Sinistrality [m] (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102933) Bomb Component + Boomerang
- [Bombardier [m] (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102733) Reward for getting all weapons, including all 4 above
- [Full Fire [m] (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102730) Limited amount of fire power-ups, so be careful with spending them on too many different bombs

Whenever you try to combine a bomb component with a boomerang or a clock, there are two possible bombs to get. Due to it being completely random and items being limited, it is possible that you constantly get one but not the other. Save your game before you make the bombs and reset the game if you get the wrong one, as the chance will reset every time.

### Step 2: No-damage Bosses (7 missable)

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/112245.png) [Damageless I: Water Commander [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102720)   
_Defeat Water Commander without taking any damage!_

-=MISSABLE=-

Water Commander's fight isn't too bad, as she throws her bombs around and very occasionally hurts herself with it. I would recommend against using bombs yourself to give yourself a bit more space to avoid the bombs, and then wait until she kills herself.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/112282.png) [Damageless II: Electrocommander [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102721)   
_Defeat Electrocommander without taking any damage!_

-=MISSABLE=-

(Note: I haven't beaten Electrocommander without taking any damage. All I can do at this point is give you advice.)   
The most annoying thing about Electrocommander is that he has homing electricity attacks, and he can kick bombs. I can recommend two strategies, with both having one item slot reserved for the jump boots. The first is having sneakers in the other slot so you can easier avoid his bombs, though he is a little bit smarter that Water Commander and most likely won't kill himself that easily, so it will be a long fight. The other is to just bring bombs and try to make him run into them. The jump boots allow you to jump over the homing electricity attacks, and it's advised to jump over them near the edge of the screen as they won't come back once they're off-screen.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/112283.png) [Damageless III: Hurricommander [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102722)   
_Defeat Hurricommander without taking any damage!_

-=MISSABLE=-

(Note: I haven't beaten Hurricommander without taking any damage. All I can do at this point is give you advice.)   
The Hurricommander is always flying and won't allow you to throw bombs at him, so the Flak Bombs are your only option (which have a small radius so good luck). The Jump Boots are absolutely required as the second item as he keeps throwing bombs at you, and you can avoid taking damage from them by timing your jump right. I would recommend the Sneakers as an equipable accessory just for that extra speed.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/112284.png) [Damageless IV: Pyro Commander [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102723)   
_Defeat Pyro Commander without taking any damage!_

-=MISSABLE=-

(Note: I haven't beaten Pyro Commander without taking any damage. All I can do at this point is give you advice.)   
The Pyro Commander isn't too bad, but he's big and has hands that float around that also fire at you. The easiest way to take care of him is with the Power Glove and Homing Bombs, with the Sneakers (Level 2) as an equipable accessory for the extra speed. His attacks are mostly predictable and his bombs always form a line, so jumping isn't necessary here.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/112285.png) [Damageless V: Mami [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102724)   
_Defeat Mami without taking any damage!_

-=MISSABLE=-

Mami can't hurt you unless you are directly next to her. This is by far the easiest fight and shouldn't give you any trouble.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/112288.png) [Damageless VI: Lewysia [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102725)   
_Defeat Lewysia without taking any damage!_

-=MISSABLE=-

I recommend waiting with this fight until you have the Remote Control, because it makes this fight a joke. Normally she would jump over bombs when they are almost exploding, but she can't predict the instant blast from a remote-controlled bomb. Just place a bomb somewhere, get in a safe space and wait for her to walk into the bomb's range.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/112289.png) [Damageless VII: Deral [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102726)   
_Defeat Deral without taking any damage!_

-=MISSABLE=-

(Note: I haven't beaten Deral without taking any damage. All I can do at this point is give you advice.)   
Deral can be annoying as she can throw bombs at you to stun you and pretty much guarantee a hit. What you can do is bringing the Remote Control and whatever bombs you prefer (I just used the regular ones) and then fire whenever she is in range, or use the Jump Shoes to jump over the blasts. Sneakers (level 2) is, as usual, the recommended equipable accessory.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/112290.png) [Damageless VIII: Chaos Bomber (25)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/102727)   
_Defeat Chaos Bomber without taking any damage!_

(Note: I haven't beaten Chaos Bomber without taking any damage. All I can do at this point is give you advice.)   
Easily the hardest boss in the game due to the amount of different attacks he has that cover most of the screen, but the most annoying part are the Gameboy Colour limitations that make the framerate go kaboom and sometimes even make bombs invisible. I have no idea how to even approach this guy, but Flak Bombs are definitely required. I guess you can switch between the Jump Shoes and Remote Control to make it easier for yourself, as he occasionally does an attack that demands you to use Jump Shoes. Oh, and he has two phases with the second phase having a similar homing attack to that of Electrocommander. Good luck!
