## Xevious (Arcade)

Xevious is one of the most influential video games of all time. Straight up, no exaggeration! After the likes of [Space Invaders](https://retroachievements.org/game/12526), [Galaxian](https://retroachievements.org/game/12139), and [Galaga](https://retroachievements.org/game/12138), it was the game that set the stage for what shoot ‘em ups would become, and to an extent, still are to this day. By today’s standards, it’s a simple game, but it’s important to understand that everything it does wasn’t set in stone or even thought of at the time. Instead of a black void, it had actual backgrounds. Instead of being stuck on a single line of movement, you could freely move. Instead of dealing with similar enemy types for the whole game, you have aerial, ground, and boss enemies that require one of two weapons to defeat. Heck, it even had a rank system long before games known for it like [Battle Garegga](https://retroachievements.org/game/13648) rolled around!

It’s truly astounding to look back on Xevious and see just how much it got right, and in order to facilitate people doing exactly that, it’s the perfect candidate for an achievement set. The [NES version](https://retroachievements.org/game/2097) does have a set and that port’s fine, but considering how important this game is to video game history, the arcade version absolutely deserves a set so that players can experience it in its original glory. Shoot ‘em ups lend themselves perfectly to achievement sets, so barring any weird problems that make development difficult, the ideas should flow naturally. Hitting certain scoring thresholds, staying alive long enough, defeating the boss before it runs away, finding the hidden point bonuses scattered throughout the game, it all tests key fundamentals of the genre. Shoot ‘em ups are intimidating to a lot of people, and while Xevious certainly isn’t an easy game, it’s one that, because of its very place in history, serves as a good starting point for the genre. The mechanics are straightforward, but you still need to be able to adapt to increasing challenges and find ways to optimize your play. Even in more complex games, the things you learn playing Xevious will absolutely help you out in the future.

If you like Japanese video games (and I know you do), there’s a good chance that someone who worked on your favorite game was either a Xevious fan, knew of Xevious, or was directly inspired by it. Some games are obviously inspired in direct ways, such as [Twinbee](https://retroachievements.org/game/12005), which uses the same air/ground differentiation for weapons and enemies. Other cases may not be so obvious; Nintendo doesn’t have much of a history with shoot ‘em ups, but Shigeru Miyamoto himself was a big Xevious fan. On Twitter in 2011, Hideo Kojima himself cited Xevious as one of the games that influenced him the most alongside other titans like [Super Mario Bros.](https://retroachievements.org/game/1446) and [The Portopia Serial Murder Case](https://retroachievements.org/game/4789). Whether you’re a fan of the genre, curious about it, or just really like video game history, Xevious is an essential video game.

## \~Hack~ Metroid: Spooky Mission 2 (Game Boy Advance)

While this is the sequel to another hack, this one stands apart as a really high quality experience that almost feels official. The first entry was more silly and short, but this has really well designed areas that feel good to explore. The secrets are also sensibly placed and never feel unfair or impossible to get. I had such a good time with this one, and I'd love to see a set for it so more folks can experience it. Also, being a bit Halloweeny themed, it would be perfect for any October events in the future.

The only way to win is to blow yourself up. Yes, put down that hotline, and let yourself take up the role of a Kamikaze pilot for this overlooked experience. You see, most shoot 'em ups would have you do a whole song and dance about shooting enemies while dodging enemy fire. Except you don't have any bullets, just a ship that can go kaboom.

With a press of a button, your life is forfeit, and the explosion can cause a chain reaction that eliminates scores of enemies while cashing in on some cool points for a high score. With flashing lights with just the right position, you'll find yourself in a mystic place filled with addicting puzzle elements, while having this special vibe that is truly something unique. There is something so addicting about this simple process; it is basic, but that leads to the idea of just "one more try" in a game that has held you hostage for hours already.

Bosses, good music, strategy, and an attachment to explosions will have you putting this in your top 10 PSP games easily.

## Destruction Derby Arenas (PlayStation 2)

## Heracles no Eikou III: Kamigami no Chinmoku (SNES/Super Famicom)

Heracles no Eikou III: Kamigami no Chinmoku (The Glory of Heracles III: Silence of the Gods) is a turn-based RPG published by [Data East](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8660). The game was developed by [Data East](https://retroachievements.org/hub/6423) and [Paon](https://retroachievements.org/hub/23026). Even with the success of similar franchises outside of Japan, Heracles no Eikou III has not seen a western release. However, fan translation patches are available.

As one might guess from the title, the game is set in ancient Greece. The protagonist wakes with amnesia, and must set off on a trek to identify himself and rediscover his past. Fantastic beasts, dangerous inventions, and vengeful gods will all plague him on his journey. Companions will join him to mitigate some risk, and will grow along with the hero on their path from a group of weaklings to a party able to challenge the gods themselves.

The game itself plays like most traditional turn-based RPGs. There are multiple worlds, a day-night system, and multiple methods of travel. Battles take place with a first-person view and are fully animated. A first glance combat seems like a direct copy of [Dragon Warrior](https://retroachievements.org/game/1471), but there are enough differences to make it feel fresh. A unique aspect is the trust system, where the player's control over the protagonist's companions is not absolute. Party trust can be improved by leveling the hero up. Magic is bestowed by the gods, with different results depending on who is worshipped.

Graphics and sound are standard fare for the time. The sprites are well done, and the different zones are fairly interesting. Animated battles are a boon for an early SNES RPG.

Give this set a wish and help to motivate others into exploring this overlooked franchise.

If you're a fan of the sports soap opera, then this game is for you. With 63 set requests, the 2011 edition of the [WWE](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7625) PlayStation saga comes with a lot of new features - most importantly, the Universe Mode. This mode allows players to book an infinite amount of matches, recreate rivalries, and create stories with their favorite wrestlers and create-a-wrestler characters. This adds the possibility of dozens of achievements for recreations of important moments in wrestling history.
 
But that's not all this game has to offer; we still have to talk about the Road To Wrestlemania. This year, we can play 6 different story modes featuring Rey Mysterio, John Cena, Christian, Chris Jericho, and a special story about ending the Undertaker Wrestlemania streak. All these storylines offer free roam and special events that make this iteration of the game mode one of the best in the series, perfect for a dev interested in creating cheevos for each important moment in these (with a lot of missables).
 
Any developer interested in the creation of massive sets should take a look at this game and challenge themselves to create one of the more complete wrestling games on the site.

If you’re into classic action-adventure games from the PS2 era, Legend of Kay is one of those underrated titles that’s easy to overlook, but totally worth playing. You take on the role of Kay, a young cat trained in martial arts, living on an island once ruled by peaceful animal clans. But things change when the gorillas and rats, now under the control of a powerful empire, invade, bringing corruption and oppression to the land. Frustrated with the elders' inaction, Kay sets out on his own to fight back, uncovering a deeper conspiracy as he battles through forests, temples, and enemy strongholds. It’s a classic “young hero rising up” kind of story, with a mix of humor, heart, and just enough edge to keep things interesting.

The combat is surprisingly slick for its time, with combos, dodges, and three different types of weapons, each with its own feel. The game mixes action, platforming, and exploration in a way that keeps things fresh without getting overwhelming. Visually, it still holds up with bright, colorful environments and a fun, cartoon-like style. It got a remaster called Legend of Kay Anniversary with updated graphics and audio, but still, the original PS2 release has its own vibe.

It might not have the name recognition of games like [Ratchet & Clank](https://retroachievements.org/game/3070) or [Jak and Daxter](https://retroachievements.org/game/2774), but if you’re into that style of gameplay, Legend of Kay fits right in.

Treasure Planet was one of the last major hand-drawn animated films made by Disney, and it's a personal favorite of mine. They gave a sci-fi twist to Treasure Island, the classic adventure novel by Robert Louis Stevenson from 1883. This imaginative reinterpretation of the story was also adapted into a PS2 game that explores more of the movie’s world, even if it's an overlooked 3D platformer.

The game follows the classic PS2-era formula: platforming, collectibles, and combat. But what really makes it stand out are the Solar Surfing levels. Imagine kite boarding, except you're on a hoverboard with a jet engine strapped at its tail. Whether you’re racing through tracks, completing time trials, or collecting objectives, these sections are fast-paced and fun! You also have a traveling companion - a cute little pink blob made of space goo appropriately named Morph, who can shapeshift into various objects that will help you on your journey.

It’s a relatively short game, and it does have some rough edges, but if you're a fan of [Jak & Daxter](https://retroachievements.org/game/2774) or other early 2000s platformers, you’ll feel right at home here.

“So you wanna be a champion?!” These are the first lines you'll hear as the intro FMV begins as you start the game. Championship Motocross Featuring Ricky Carmichael is quite a long name, so I'll be referring to it as Motocross from here on out. It is a motorcycle racing game with a variety of tracks and a rock/metal soundtrack. It also has different bikes with different attributes you can set before a race. Being a motorcycle game, you can do tricks throughout the race through a combination of buttons. You have the standard wheelie and other tricks like no footer, no hander, and superman. There is also a weather system that makes the track more slippery. Besides progression achievements, a developer could add achievements for doing tricks and such. If you're looking for a fun motocross game, give Championship Motocross Featuring Ricky Carmichael a try!

For those of you who are at least mildly aware of the [Nicktoons](https://retroachievements.org/hub/23409) games available on RA, you may know that the PS2 version of [Globs of Doom](https://retroachievements.org/game/20837) is available to play right now, so you might be wondering why I am highlighting a version of this game that is on a far weaker console for any reason other than covering all of the bases for this sub-series and nostalgia. However, aside from the fact that nostalgia is indeed involved, having grown up with this game myself, I also must highlight how impressive I find this game as its own experience.

Much like the console version, you play as a variety of Nickelodeon characters, both heroes and villains, as they attempt to stop the invasion of the slimy Morphoids from taking over their respective worlds. However, unlike the rather monotonous beat 'em up format that its high definition counterpart takes on, this version functions as more of a puzzle platformer. You take control of two characters whom you can switch between freely, and your goal is to guide the both of them to the end of each level utilizing their unique abilities. With each of these levels being tailor-made with these characters in mind while still retaining the look and feel of their respective universes, it creates a far more streamlined experience than its console counterpart that's a blast to go through.

It isn't too long, and the game isn't that complicated, particularly when it comes to the bosses, but for a licensed 2D platformer, it's genuinely a fun time that I would frankly recommend over the PS2 version, having played that one by this point, and hopefully more people will experience this game if a set is ever created. Personally, I can hardly wait!
