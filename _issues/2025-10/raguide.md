# Introduction

Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is a first-person shooter developed by EA Los Angeles and released in 2003. Set during World War II, the game follows the perspective of a U.S. soldier as they fight through the Pacific Theater. Players are thrust into iconic battles, from the attack on Pearl Harbor to various island skirmishes against the Imperial Japanese Army. With a gripping single-player campaign and multiplayer options, Rising Sun immerses players in historical warfare, offering an engaging and challenging experience. The game combines tactical combat, cinematic storytelling, and intense action sequences to bring the chaos and heroism of WWII to life.

This guide will cover each mission in detail, going over the location of all collectables, the completion of bonus objectives, and the needed thresholds to unlock the mission Service Medals. I've included numerous playthrough videos for each mission, including notable times within each video, as well as several screenshots to assist with finding items. Along with these, I found it useful to get a bird's-eye view of the maps and where some items are located. This [GameFAQs ASCII Map Guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/589715-medal-of-honor-rising-sun/faqs/27309) is really helpful to visualize and simplify some of the more convoluted sections of the maps. Note that some of these maps are not completely accurate with item placement but they are more than sufficient as additional resources for this guide.

As with all guides, I strongly recommend playing through the game before seeking out guidance from this or any other guide.

## Game Details

- There are 9 total mission in this game.
    - Mission 2 is unique compared to the other missions. This mission is an autoscroller; while it contains bonus objectives, it does not contain any other collectibles like the other missions. As such, this mission has several fewer achievements compared to the others.
- In order to receive the Service Medal (and Skeleton Key) for any given mission, you must complete all bonus objectives (yellow on the pause screen) and complete the level with a specific threshold met for both accuracy and hits taken. All bonus objectives and thresholds are detailed in the relevant sections throughout this guide.
    - Missions 1 and 2 are the only exceptions; these only have bonus objective requirements.
- The Skeleton Key is used to open a hidden chest in each mission. Each chest contains a unique multiplayer skin.
- There are two tools that are collected in later missions that can help with completing missions easier, collecting Film Canisters, and unlocking cheat codes.
    - These are the **Machete** and **Entrenching Tool**.  
- Each mission contains two hidden Film Canisters that unlock a Valor In History and Storyboard extra on the main menu.
    - Some of these Film Canisters can be collected on the first playthrough of a mission, while others may require the Machete
- Each mission contains a hidden cheat code.
    - This can be unlocked by using the Entrenching Tool on a specific location within the mission.

## Mastery Tips

- Grenades will explode on contact and can easily take out a group of enemies.
- Your melee attacks are one-hit kills.
- Save spots mid-mission are allowed; use them if you need to.
- Service Medal Tips:
    - These are going to be tough; play through the mission and learn which enemies can be avoided.
    - Oftentimes it's better to take a hit and melee the enemy rather than trying to avoid being hit and shooting them.
        - Enemies can have really good or really bad accuracy, it's a bit of a coin flip.
    - Avoid using automatic weapons if possible; they will destroy your accuracy.
    - Check your accuracy and hits taken on the pause menu.
    - The mounted machine gunners and foxhole enemies can easily hit you 5-10 times within seconds.
        - Know where these enemies are and try to get out of sight when they first aggro to you.
- Ammo Saver Tips:
    - Git gud at aiming your grenades
        - **This is the most important tip I can give for these achievements.**
    - Melee seems to be faster for certain weapons (like the shotgun or M1); switch to those weapons right away.
    - The enemy swordsman does a ton of damage if they hit you.
        - Be very cautious of them while going in for melee kills.
    - Don't try to kill every enemy.
        - In many cases it's better to push forward with the potential to take a hit or two then to try to kill every enemy
    - Canteens and other health items are quite abundant.
        - If you need to, backtrack to previous areas to refill your HP before progressing

## Difficulty

All the videos I've recorded for this guide play through the game on Hard mode to show that each and every achievement is possible on that difficulty. The writeups are written from that difficulty perspective as well, so some of the more difficult parts mentioned may be much easier than expected if playing on Normal difficulty. The main difference between Hard and Normal difficulty is the amount of damage you take from enemies. If any achievement requires a specific difficulty, then it will be explicitly called out in the description.

# Walkthrough
## Single Player
This section will cover the single player achievements, going mission by mission. Each mission's section will go over the Bonus Objectives needed to collect the Skeleton Key, the Film Canister locations, Cheat location, and the Multiplayer Skin location.

Included are multiple videos for each mission showing the hard mode, Service Medal, and Ammo Saver achievements being completed. As well as several screenshots showing the location of all the collectible items. I've included timestamp links to the video for all collectables at the beginning of each mission section.

### Mission 1: Day of Infamy

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bde40b8c-d318-490e-b1bb-15510be0e1c3)

| {% raachpic 252989, 280529, Day of Infamy %} | Complete Day of Infamy on normal or greater difficulty. |
| {% raachpic 252990, 280529, Day of Infamy [Hard] %} | Complete Day of Infamy on hard difficulty. |

The unexpected attack by more than 300 Japanese naval aircraft devastated the US Pacific Fleet; 21 ships were badly damaged or sunk, including 8 battleships. The surprised sailors and Marines fought with the flames and wreckage of their own dying ships as well as the enemy planes.

This introductory mission is as easy as it gets. Make your way through the USS California, helping any survivors and collecting any items. Get topside and defend the ship from the Japanese attack.

#### American Defense Service Medal

| {% raachpic 253016, 280547, American Defense Service %} | Receive the American Defense Service medal in Day of Infamy. |

The American Defense Service Medal and Skeleton Key is unlocked by completing the mission with the following conditions met:  
- Both bonus objectives have been complete.

**Bonus Objective 1: Assist Engineer**

After ducking under the pipes, locate an engineer struggling to close a large red hatch. Approach the hatch and press action to assist with closing it and complete the objective.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea01e80f-be35-4ed9-9f39-88c70a7dad1c">

**Bonus Objective 2: Save Crewman**

After obtaining the fire extinguisher and putting out the initial flames, you'll notice a door to the left engulfed in flames. Inside, a crewman screams for help. Use the extinguisher to clear the flames at the doorway and inside the room to save the crewman and complete the objective.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e2867eb-82e1-4678-b37a-399665541a08">

#### Film Canisters

| {% raachpic 253026, 280557, Reward For A Good Deed %} | Find the Film Canister to unlock the Valor In History for Day of Infamy. |

Follow the guide through the barber room into the post office. Inside, locate the black netting that can be cut with the machete. Behind it, you'll find the Film Canister.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a94ef5d-77ab-48d0-a99e-b39a47806959"> <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f3f4e6-c379-421f-9847-0cd4d0c2083b">

<br><br>

| {% raachpic 253034, 280565, Mail Time %} | Find the Film Canister to unlock the Storyboard for Day of Infamy. |

In the room where you save the crewman from the flames, find the Film Canister around the corner on the floor.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efb774a2-8bf7-4397-b32f-11fd57e77a04">

#### Cheat: Unlimited Ammo

| {% raachpic 253050, 280581, Unlimited Ammo %} | Use the Entrenching Tool to unlock the Unlimited Ammo cheat code in Day of Infamy. |

After meeting the guide, take a left down the hallway instead of following him into the barber room. Alternatively, if you follow the guide, turn left down the hall after leaving the Post Office to reach the same location. In front of the crewman who gets blasted by steam, locate a vent on the wall. Use the Entrenching Tool on the vent to unlock the Unlimited Ammo cheat.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0e3fd6e-8ac0-44c4-b0b8-c3dc2193f9ab">

#### Multiplayer Skin: Navy Engineer

| {% raachpic 253042, 280573, Navy Engineer %} | Use the Skeleton Key to unlock the Navy Engineer multiplayer skin in Day of Infamy. |

Follow the guide into the barber room. Inside, locate a chest containing the Navy Engineer multiplayer skin. Use the Skeleton Key to open it.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/922ee0ab-2011-474a-ac10-56c1408ee5f8">

### Mission 2: Pearl Harbor

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4568a6f5-6301-42c9-b68a-df68f3ef8268)

| {% raachpic 252991, 280530, Pearl Harbor %} | Complete Pearl Harbor on normal or greater difficulty. |
| {% raachpic 252992, 280530, Pearl Harbor [Hard] %} | Complete Pearl Harbor on hard difficulty. |

While the attack on Pearl Harbor would be counted as one of history's great tactical victories, it would also rank among one of the greatest strategic mistakes. The devastation united a divided nation and forces immediate entry of the US into the war, whose greater size and industrial capacity led inevitably to Japanese defeat.

The Pearl Harbor mission is one big auto-scroller. The whole time you are gunning down attacking Japanese planes. The mission itself is pretty easy; just keep shooting down the oncoming planes, and you'll eventually escort the USS Nevada and complete the mission. The real challenge comes with the bonus objectives.

#### Navy Distinguished Service Medal

| {% raachpic 253017, 280548, Navy Distinguished Service %} | Receive the Navy Distinguished Service medal in Pearl Harbor. |

**Bonus Objective 1: Shoot down 20 planes** & **Bonus Objective 2: Shoot down 75 planes**

Shooting down 20 planes is very easy; you can get that without even trying. Shooting down 75 planes is a bit more challenging and will certainly take a few attempts. My best advice is to hone in your controls and learn the patterns of the planes: what direction they come from, how many there are, and their flying formation. By the time the USS Arizona is bombed, you should have about 40 planes shot down. At the end, never stop firing after escorting the USS Nevada; you can still take the high flying planes out to get to the 75 count.

### Mission 3: Fall of the Philippines

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfff36bb-bd5c-4744-9895-a620232e10cf)

| {% raachpic 252993, 280531, Fall of the Philippines %} | Complete Fall of the Philippines on normal or greater difficulty. |
| {% raachpic 252994, 280531, Fall of the Philippines [Hard] %} | Complete Fall of the Philippines on hard difficulty. |

US forces in the Philippines were stranded by the Japanese victory at Pearl Harbor. Battle-hardened Japanese troops invaded the islands, forcing the defenders into a retreat that ended in a hopeless siege. Thousands of US and Filipino soldiers were taken captive when US forces surrendered.

The Fall of the Philippines is the first real typical mission in the game. You actually get to run around, complete objectives, fight off some Japanese, and die trying. Overall, this mission is pretty straightforward with the objectives and where to go next. There are a couple of sections that have split paths that you can choose from. The ending of this level is pretty cool as you are making your way back with the explosives truck. Ultimately, your main objective is to locate the explosives truck and use it to destroy the bridge that you start on before Japanese forces can cross it.

#### Philippine Defense Medal

| {% raachpic 253018, 280549, Philippine Defense %} | Receive the Philippine Defense medal in Fall of the Philippines. |

The Philippine Defense Medal and Skeleton Key is unlocked by completing the mission with the following conditions met:  
- Both bonus objectives have been complete.  
- 75% or greater accuracy.  
- 99 or fewer hits taken.

With a 99 or fewer hit requirement, this Service Medal is pretty straightforward to get. It's shown off in the video above.

**Bonus Objective 1: Found Commander Shima's Photograph**

After reaching Shima field, make your way to the room alongside the third base line where you disable to radio post. In this room is a small box in the corner; break the box to reveal and collect Commander Shima's photograph.

**Bonus Objective 2: Found Golden Buddha**

Exit the Shima field through the grate in right field. Follow it through until you emerge in a rubbled building. Near the building exit, there is a large box that can be broken three times, revealing the Golden Buddha.

#### Ammo Saver

| {% raachpic 253007, 280538, Fall of the Philippines - Ammo Saver %} | Complete Fall of the Philippines on normal or greater difficulty without taking any shots. [Mounted weapons excluded] |

Welcome to the first mission with an "Ammo Saver" achievement. Most of these are all pretty similar in how to approach them. Switch to the fastest melee weapon, don't try to kill every enemy, use grenades, and go fast. Save spots can be used to retry sections without invalidating the achievement. You are generally not going to play the mission much differently than you normally would, but here is my write-up on some tips and a video showing my run of the achievement.

Upon entering the first area, switch to the M1 Garand and throw a grenade to the right to kill the three incoming enemies while moving left to melee the single enemy on that side. Make your way to the tank cogwheel and repair the tank. There are a couple of health pickups on the left side if you take too much damage. Follow the tank as it goes through the streets, keeping as much out of sight from the enemies with the higher ground while taking out the ground-level enemies with either melee or grenades. When you reach the area with the four buildings in the middle of the square, be sure to defeat all enemies on the ground; you can hide and wait for your friendly tank to catch up. When your tank stops and the next objective is initiated, several more enemies will spawn in. Take these out as necessary and collect any necessary health and grenade pickups before proceeding.

At this point the doors to one of the previously passed buildings will blow up, allowing you to enter. Guarding these doors are a couple of enemies and an enemy tank. If you have a good amount of health, you can just run by them and pick up the health inside. Otherwise, you can grenade the enemies and the tank to destroy it. Behind the stairs is a save point; use it if you need to. Exit the building upstairs through the broken wall to avoid extra enemies. Slide down the wood on the right side and melee the enemy at the mounted gun. Using the mounted gun will spawn in a dozen enemies, so ignore it and continue on towards Shima Field.

The two ground enemies outside the Shima field door will both drop a canteen if you need some health. Make your way into the sewers and towards the left field entrance into the field. There are a couple of enemies here that you can choose to kill if you wish. Otherwise, follow the third baseline to the bleachers and make your way to disable the radio post. Afterwards, follow the bleachers along the outer edge to the machine gunner room along the first base line. Kill the enemy in there and, again, avoid using the mounted gun to prevent several enemies from spawning in. Make your way to right field to exit Shima Field; get your grenades ready as three enemies will spawn in right when you turn the corner to leave. Kill these enemies and take the sewer exit to leave the field. Break the boxes in the sewer to collect some health.

Exit the sewer and kill the enemy immediately to your left. Exit the rubbled building and head right to collect more health and grenades if needed. Continue on to the building before the church courtyard and make your way to the roof of the building. If you are low on health at this point, you can launch grenades over the barrier to avoid being shot; otherwise, you can gun down the enemies and tank. You can pick up more health while leaving the building towards the church. In the church there is another save point you can use if needed; otherwise, right the bell to the church and make your way to the explosives truck. Stock up on any grenades and health before getting on the truck.

Ideally at this point you have full health and 20 grenades. In this section you are a sitting duck in the back of the truck. You cannot hide behind and cover; you can crouch in hope of avoiding any shots. Right off the bat, you need to ricochet a grenade off the wall to blow up the gunner at the start; otherwise, he will destroy you. After this, the most important thing is to destroy the tank that will be following you, its machine gun, and really take your health down fast. Keep throwing grenades behind you towards the tank until it has exploded; the second explosion will completely disable the tank. After this it's a matter of choosing where to throw your remaining grenades. There is a machine gunner after the second turn that you can ricochet a grenade to kill. Prioritize the machine gunners first and then aim for the explosive barrels to help with taking the enemies out. As you progress through this section, you will automatically pick up some health. If you are low on health and have no grenades, you can alternate crouching and standing up in hopes of avoiding being killed.

### Mission 4: Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/583d3cf6-ab5d-4e93-a845-16675a31b9bd)

| {% raachpic 252995, 280532, Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal %} | Complete Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal on normal or greater difficulty. |
| {% raachpic 252996, 280532, Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal [Hard] %} | Complete Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal on hard difficulty. |

Guadalcanal, a small island in the Solomon chain, became a critical battlefield for control of the Pacific; Japanese planes based there could cut the Allied supply chain to Australia. A small US force invaded the island under cover of night and faced their enemy for the first time in dense jungle and hostile terrain.

This is my least favorite mission. It's super dark, enemies pop out of their foxholes all over the place, the bonus objective is easy to miss, and there are multiple branching paths with dense jungle making it easy to get lost. Have no fear; we'll get through it. This mission starts you off in a boat riding upstream along the canal. There are two drop-off points, with the first being optional. Always take the first drop-off; it gives you access to one of the bonus objective documents, and you can eliminate enemies on land, which is much easier. Throughout this mission you are ambushed by enemies hidden in the ground as well as machine gunners in camouflaged bunkers. Most of these you can just go around the side and eliminate the enemies. All the split paths lead to the ending; however, if you are going for the optional objectives, you will have to do some backtracking, as this is the first mission that involves collecting multiple items to satisfy a bonus objective. Certain paths are much easier than others, but your goal remains the same: infiltrate the Japanese and destroy their supplies.

#### Guadalcanal Patch Medal

| {% raachpic 253019, 280550, Guadalcanal Patch %} | Receive the Guadalcanal Patch medal in Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal. |

The Guadalcanal Patch medal and Skeleton Key is unlocked by completing the mission with the following conditions met:  
- Both bonus objectives have been complete.  
- 75% or greater accuracy.  
- 49 or fewer hits taken.

This is where the Service Medals become more challenging to get. The combination of the accuracy and hits taken is particularly hard on this level because of the backtracking and hidden enemies that pop out of the ground. The Springfield is also terrible, with really slow shot speed, and it doesn't one-shot unless it's a headshot. Not ideal when you need to have high accuracy and low hits. I've included another video here specifically for this achievement to show how I completed it. Not much different from the video above, just playing it a bit safer to avoid being hit too many times.

**Bonus Objective 1: Generator Destroyed**

The generator is located in the area just after exiting the last tunnel. The music in this area changes to a more combat-themed tune. The generator can be destroyed by using the mounted gun in the truck or by destroying nearby explosive barrels.

<br><br>

**Bonus Objective 2: Intelligence Documents Collected**

Throughout the mission there are five intelligence documents that need to all be collected. The first document can be missed, but the others can be collected in any order. The order listed below is my recommended order and flows best with the rest of the guides and videos for this mission:
- Documents 1
    - At the beginning of the mission, get off the boat at the first chance you get. Follow the path to the end, where you reach the bunker, killing all enemies in your way. Inside the bunker is the first set of documents.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43f6b12d-1773-41b0-ac98-ac36762a7a43">  
- Documents 2
    - After everyone gets off the boat and navigates up the path, you will be ambushed by the enemy. Make your way around the ambush into the bunker to find the second set of documents.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0996760-4588-4eb5-a838-2b7261acd919">  
- Documents 3
    - After taking the path between the two guard towers, the next area contains a crane and two buildings. Go inside the larger of the two buildings to find the third set of documents lying on one of the beds.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cf064b1-4f60-4773-9833-7b1968dc3bcc">  
- Documents 4
    - Before the entrance to the last tunnel, there is yet another bunker. Inside this bunker is the fourth set of documents.  
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da055db2-1221-43c7-8096-47bc0dfefabe">  
- Documents 5
    - After the areas with the generator, you'll run into the final building that you have to enter. Upstairs in the northmost room, lying on the bed, is the last set of documents.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/996f08dd-8252-4659-b44c-dfa55315c9e3">

#### Film Canisters

| {% raachpic 253028, 280559, Great View From Up Here %} | Find the Film Canister to unlock the Valor In History for Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal. |

Take the path between the two guard towers to the area with the crane. Jump up on the back of the crane and walk up the arm. At the end of the arm, you'll find the first Film Canister.

| {% raachpic 253036, 280567, Second Story Hideout %} | Find the Film Canister to unlock the Storyboard for Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal. |

Take the path across from the two guard towers to the area with the Bullet Shield cheat. Go behind all the boxes on the first floor of the building and jump on them until you reveal the path to the second Film Canister on the second floor.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3da9008-24d1-4d4a-8f7b-90dc08d399c4"> <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fb9fcdf-9501-4f2e-baac-234bea0189fb">

#### Cheat: Bullet Shield

| {% raachpic 253052, 280583, Bullet Shield %} | Use the Entrenching Tool to unlock the Bullet Shield cheat code in Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal. |

Take the path across from the two guard towers to the area with the second Film Canister. On the side of the building there is a pile of dirt that leads underneath to the tunnel. Use the Entrenching Tool on the dirt pile to unlock the Bullet Shield cheat.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b83dc3e-55e9-434c-8388-0274c48cdf8e">

  
#### Multiplayer Skin: Guad Native

| {% raachpic 253044, 280575, Guad Native %} | Use the Skeleton Key to unlock the Guad Native multiplayer skin in Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal. |

After the areas with the generator, you'll run into the final building that you have to enter. Downstairs, in one of the northernmost rooms, you locate the chest containing the Guad Native multiplayer skin. Use the Skeleton Key to open it.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a5d257e-cd6e-4574-8f5c-9ac8d770352f">

#### Ammo Saver

| {% raachpic 253008, 280539, Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal - Ammo Saver %} | Complete Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal on normal or greater difficulty without taking any shots. [Mounted weapons excluded] |

Like most, this Ammo Saver achievement is not that bad because of the amount of cover and health drops you can collect. We can play it a bit faster and safer than the videos above play the level because we don't need to get any bonus objectives, though many sections will still be played the same.

Start off by taking the optional drop-off point from the boat. You would rather take on these enemies on land than be a sitting duck on the boat. Also, the machine gunner can easily kill you if you aren't able to grenade him from the boat. Make your way past the boat section to the first ambush. Stay along the side, melee enemies as you run into them, and then grenade the enemies in the bunker to take them out. Clear out the rest of the enemies with the machine gun and collect any needed health to complete this section.

Make your way through the tunnel and take the right path when exiting; there are fewer enemies here. Make your way to the truck and take out the enemies here. I usually just toss a couple of grenades and one on the truck to take the gunner out as well. As you press forward, a few more enemies will pop out in front and behind you. You can choose to deal with them as you like depending on your health. Recommend at least killing the enemies in front so they don't gun you down as you run past them. Continue on until you reach the area with the two guard towers. Take out the enemy on the hill to the right and then toss some grenades to the couple of enemies between the towers. Make your way down the path between the two towers to the area with the crane; there will be a handful of enemies here that I recommend taking out. Pick up any needed health afterwards; collecting the Film Canister and dropping it into the truck has a large health pickup as well.

Continue down this path and keep left; this is not the path we took in the videos above, but it has many fewer enemies. You'll eventually make your way to an open area with a bunker in the distance. Guess what? It's another ambush. Keep to the right side and make your way around to the back entrance to the bunker, taking out the couple of enemies in the way. Gun down any remaining enemies from the bunker, collect any needed health, and make your way into the tunnel right behind the bunker. From here your path to the end of the game is fully linear. Exit the tunnel and turn into the first garage and melee the two enemies in there. Jump onto the truck and mow down any Japanese enemies that start running towards you. Some of these enemies spawn in regardless of if you use the gun, so it's better to use it to take them all out. Afterwards, make your way to the final building and section of the mission.

Before entering the last building, 3-4 enemies will spawn in. If you have grenades, toss them towards the two explosive barrels and run up to melee any remaining enemies. Make your way into the house and upstairs, taking out the enemies in your way. You don't need to kill all the enemies downstairs. There are multiple health drops in the upstairs section if you need them. Make your way downstairs and out into the ammo depot. With full life, it's pretty safe to just make a run to the big machine gun, using it to take out the ammo depot, all the approaching enemies, and the tank. Afterwards, run around to refill on missing health and make your way to the final section. Hop in the trench, take hold of the machine gun, and get ready for the final assault. Prioritize taking out the swordsman as they approach you. If they get by, get off the gun and melee them. They can kill you very fast without you realizing it. You have a safety health pack in the trench if you need it and you cannot get out once you jump in. Other than that, take out the rest of the enemies and collect your achievement.

### Mission 5: Pistol Pete Showdown

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13ae749a-a57e-441b-8e93-3ad834b3a181)

| {% raachpic 252997, 280533, Pistol Pete Showdown %} | Complete Pistol Pete Showdown on normal or greater difficulty. |
| {% raachpic 252998, 280533, Pistol Pete Showdown [Hard] %} | Complete Pistol Pete Showdown on hard difficulty. |

The capture of the airfield did not end the fighting on Guadalcanal. The Japanese still had control of the seas, and a fresh force soon arrived to retake the island from the Allies. Entrenched artillery positions and hidden snipers made the airfield all but unusable.

This mission is fairly straightforward with very little deviation off of a main path through it. You start off in the jungle with the goal of meeting up with local resistance forces in order to find and rescue lost Allied patrols. After freeing the prisoners, one of them being Harrison, you must escort Harrison to Pistol Pete so he can blow up a couple of artillery guns in order to protect Henderson Field. Throughout this escort, you'll travel through dense jungle with foxholes and tunnels filled with enemies with the goal to destroy all three artillery guns. Afterwards you and Harrison will make your way to the final bridge to blow that up as well.

#### Machete

| {% raachpic 253014, 280545, It's Chopping Time %} | Find the Machete in Pistol Pete Showdown. |

The machete can finally be collected and used throughout the other missions. After clearing out all the enemies in the area with the three tied-up prisoners, make your way to the back of the largest building. Crouch down and go under the building to collect the machete.

#### American Campaign Medal

| {% raachpic 253020, 280551, American Campaign %} | Receive the American Campaign medal in Pistol Pete Showdown. |

The American Campaign medal and Skeleton Key is unlocked by completing the mission with the following conditions met:  
- Both bonus objectives have been complete.  
- 75% or greater accuracy.  
- 49 or fewer hits taken.

This one can be a little tricky in some places. As long as you have relatively good aim, you won't have much of an issue getting 75% accuracy. Use the M1 Garand throughout the entire mission for the best results. The real challenge here is taking less than 50 hits. There are multiple areas in this mission that are stuffed with enemies; you can easily tack on 5-10 hits if you are not careful. Knowing where to take cover and carefully aiming your grenades is key to unlocking the Service Medal for this mission. The bonus objectives are very easy to get along the way, so they aren't adding any additional difficulty to the run. I will note that it is possible to despawn Harrison after the final artillery gun has been blown up. Not sure how it happens, but it happened in my video playthrough above. The video mentioned above shows my run unlocking this achievement.

**Bonus Objective 1: Storm Pack Howitzer Emplacement**

Make your way to the howitzer after freeing the prisoners; keep to the left and take this hidden path to avoid additional enemies. Eliminate all the enemies operating the howitzer to complete this objective.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49ffd0be-71aa-4155-b452-afa450c8da4d">

**Bonus Objective 2: Harrison Saved**

At the very end of the mission, Harrison will be wounded while planting explosives on the bridge. Walk up to him and press action to save him and complete this objective.

#### Film Canisters

| {% raachpic 253029, 280560, Mortar Breaks Everything %} | Find the Film Canister to unlock the Valor In History for Pistol Pete Showdown. |

Make your way to the howitzer after freeing the prisoners. Use it to destroy the large black rock in the middle of the area. The first Film Canister will be left in place of the exploded rock.

| {% raachpic 253053, 280584, Men With Hats %} | Use the Entrenching Tool to unlock the Men With Hats cheat code in Pistol Pete Showdown. |

After securing the howitzer and continuing on with the mission, you will come across a small stream with machine gunners on both sides. Just after this, on the right side, is a path that leads to a save point. On the ground next to the save point is a pile of dirt. Use the Entrenching Tool on the dirt pile to unlock the Men With Hats cheat.

#### Ammo Saver

| {% raachpic 253009, 280540, Pistol Pete Showdown - Ammo Saver %} | Complete Pistol Pete Showdown on normal or greater difficulty without taking any shots. [Mounted weapons excluded] |

The starting area is pretty empty, and the entire left side can be ignored. Take the right path and kill the couple of enemies in your way until you reach the machine gunner. Use the machine gun to take out the approaching enemies to enable the NPC dialog. If you are low on health, there are a couple of health pickups behind the machine gun. Listen to the NPC dialog and go through the tunnel to reach the area with the three prisoners. In this area you can chuck a grenade just in front of the prisoners to take out three enemies. After which you can rush the area and take out all the enemies. If you take the left path around the large building, you can pretty easily sneak up on the remaining enemies. Collect any needed health and cut free the prisoners to listen to the dialog.

Rush through the bombed fence section and keep left; there is a hidden path that can be cut with the machete that leads straight to the howitzer, avoiding multiple enemies. Follow the path to the open area and chuck a couple of grenades over the rock on the left towards the howitzer. Rush the howitzer and take out any remaining enemies. Use the howitzer to take out the rushing enemies on both the left and right, as well as the approaching tank. There are tons of health pickups in this section; you should leave with full health.

The next couple of areas pick up in difficulty as you trek through the jungle and into the caves. Lots of enemies, machine gunners, and foxholes in the way. Continue on until you reach the first stream; there is a machine gunner on each side, though neither one is really any threat. The closer guy is tough to take out with a grenade because of the angle, but you can chuck one towards him and then charge forward for the melee kill. On your way you can toss a grenade across the stream to the other enemies to take them out. Walk across the bridge and use the machine gun to take out the 4-5 enemies that will run into the area. There is a save point on the right after the machine guns if you need it.

The next section until you get to the caves is pretty packed with enemies. There will be enemies up high and down low that will be constantly firing at you. The best advice I can give is to take your time, try to get the high ground when you can so you can take cover easier, and go grenade heavy. Make your way through the path until you reach the waterfall; here there is one enemy on the high route and a bunch on the ground level. You'll need to take out a couple of the ground-level enemies first with grenades before taking the high ground. From there you can chuck grenades to kill the rest of the enemies as well as the 4-5 that are blocking your path forward. There is a health pack at the base of the waterfall, as well as several others dropped by the enemies that you can pick up. When you are ready, make your way forward into the tunnels.

The tunnels aren't too bad, but there are a couple sections that can kill you quick if you aren't ready. Follow the tunnel path to the location of the first artillery gun and melee the enemies in your way. As you approach the gun, be ready, as there are half a dozen enemies that spawn in. Pop your head in and toss a couple of grenades to take most of them out. There is a save point here with a med pack that you can take. When ready, blow up the gun. Afterwards, two enemies will come through the open door, easy melee kills. The next section has a bridge in an open area with several enemies; you can avoid most of them by dropping off to the right and going through the exit.

At this point you'll be outside again, and there will be three enemies on the other side of the canyon shooting you. You can take cover behind some boxes and try to grenade the enemies, but you will only be able to grenade the ground level one. Rush across the bridge, collect health on the ground, and take out the last two enemies on the stairs. Proceed up the stairs towards the bunker entrance, hugging the left side of the map to avoid being gunned down. You can toss a couple of grenades in if you have them; otherwise, wait for Harrison to blow the door open. Through the door is the second artillery gun; there are about five enemies in here, so chuck in some grenades to take them out. After the gun explodes, it will open another door leading to another tunnel path. There are a lot of enemies on this path, one after the other. You can easily be killed here if you are not careful. If you are feeling risky, you can run through and melee the enemies one by one; otherwise, keep your distance and take them out slowly with grenades. There are lots of breakable boxes here for health drops. Continue through the cave, taking out the enemies in your way until you reach the final artillery gun. As usual, there will be multiple enemies here; take them out with grenades.

With the final artillery gun destroyed, you can make your way to the final area. If you want, you can take out the couple of enemies in front of the bridge; otherwise, you can very easily just run across and take cover behind one of the boxes and wait for the mission to complete.

The Ammo Saver achievement is completed in the first video of this mission section. Reference that video for how I completed this achievement.

### Mission 6: Singapore Sling

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19db9808-dbe4-4f2d-ac26-2345333e9858)

| {% raachpic 252999, 280534, Singapore Sling %} | Complete Singapore Sling on normal or greater difficulty. |
| {% raachpic 253000, 280534, Singapore Sling [Hard] %} | Complete Singapore Sling on hard difficulty. |

Despite being viewed as the Impregnable Fortress of Malaya, Singapore quickly fell to the Japanese. The beleaguered Allied forces surrendered in February of 1942, and Singapore was placed under martial law. Underground resistance remained strong amongst the Chinese, Malay, Indian, and British citizens.

This mission is one of my favorites. It's the only mission that allows you to play in a stealthy way for the beginning half of the mission. While you won't get grenades, you will get the Welrod. The Welrod is a single-clip, one-shot kill pistol, though I've seen some hard mode enemies take two shots to kill for some reason. The enemies in this mission appear to be more blind than in other missions; not knowing where you are after shooting them plays into the overall stealth aspect. Anyway, your goal here is to meet up with Tanaka and Bromley in order to infiltrate the Axis Summit. After being discovered at the Summit, the action will pick up as you run and gun your way through the hotel and escape with the stolen slide reel.

#### Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal

| {% raachpic 253021, 280552, Marine Corps Expeditionary %} | Receive the Marine Corps Expeditionary medal in Singapore Sling. |

The Marine Corps Expeditionary medal and Skeleton Key is unlocked by completing the mission with the following conditions met:  
 - Both bonus objectives have been complete.  
 - 75% or greater accuracy.  
 - 49 or fewer hits taken.

Even though you don't get grenades in this mission, this Service Medal is one of the easier ones. The first half of this mission can be played very stealthy and with the combination of the one shot-kill Welrod, you can rack up a high accuracy with a small hit count. This will give you some cushion for the second half, where you only have an automated weapon and, again, no grenades. At various points throughout this mission, you will have Bromley at your side. You can let him take care of the enemies while you hide in cover to keep your hit count low. The bonus objectives in this mission are all very easy to get, most tasks being in the direct path of completing the mission, with one POW that you need to go out of your way to save.

The Service Medal achievement is completed in the first video of this mission section. Reference that video for how I completed this achievement.

**Bonus Objective 1: POW Rescued**

Throughout the first section of the mission, there are three POWs that need to be saved. The first one can easily be missed if you don't explore enough, while the last two you will naturally save as you progress in the mission. Below are the three POW locations in the order that you will come across them:
- POW 1
    - After your rickshaw crashes, you make your way to the large town square. Assuming you enter the square from the south, on the top floor of the building on the far west will be a small room where the first POW is being held captive. Enter the room to save the POW.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bdc8665-b72b-4b78-add1-7507dd20250b">  
- POW 2
    - After the following Bromley and taking Colonel Kandler's uniform, you will take to the rooftops. The fourth rooftop that you move to will have the second POW that you can save. You can't miss this POW as you progress through the mission.  
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f18e4f32-57a2-4092-8148-95f67e6fa94a">  
- POW 3
    - At the end of the rooftop section, you will enter a small building. In the first room are two enemies, and in the following hallway on the right is the third and final POW. Rescue him to complete the bonus objective.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf5335db-0535-485c-b1b1-8f11402113e3">

**Bonus Objective 2: Additional Evidence Collected (3/3)**

Throughout the second section of the mission, there are three pieces of additional evidence that need to be collected. They can very easily be missed if you are not careful when looking for them. You can backtrack to get them all if any are missed when you reach the end of the mission. Below are the three additional evidence locations in the order that you will come across them:
- Additional Evidence 1
    - After reaching the hotel and being caught as an imposter, you must escape through the downstairs kitchen. Sitting on the left side of the first table in the kitchen is the first set of additional evidence.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b343d35b-83a1-4944-bba6-298674d74ec1">  
- Additional Evidence 2
    - After making your way through the kitchen, you will proceed upstairs to a bar area. In the middle of the bar top is the second set of additional evidence.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9df9831-3701-4cba-adfb-b7ef52e994c8">  
- Additional Evidence 3
    - After exiting the bar down the hallway, there is a room that opens to the left and right. The room on the right leads to the end of the mission. Just before leaving the room to go onto the balcony is a footrest with the final set of additional evidence.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f06bc78-c325-4934-af29-0d44cf514402">

#### Film Canisters

| {% raachpic 253030, 280561, A Hidden Path Leads to Riches %} | Find the Film Canister to unlock the Valor In History for Singapore Sling. |

Upon entering the main city square, if you continue to move forward, you will see an open garage on the right side. In here you can take the small path underground to a storage room with a few enemies in it. In this room there is a small ramp to an upper section. The first Film Canister is located in this section on the ground.

After meeting up with Bromley, he will take you to an underground section. In the room with all the enemies, go down the stairs and turn around. The second Film Canister will be sitting on the table.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba2bb827-8f39-4302-9f10-a10d25440719">

#### Cheat : Achilles Head

| {% raachpic 253054, 280585, Achilles Head %} | Use the Entrenching Tool to unlock the Achilles Head cheat code in Singapore Sling. |

After your rickshaw crashes, you make your way to the large town square. Assuming you enter the square from the south, make your way to the south-westernmost building. After entering the building on the ground floor, at the base of the stairs is a broken air vent. Use the Entrenching Tool on the air vent to unlock the Achilles Head cheat.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dec87861-4276-4b19-a6f1-ff717f2c1d2e">

Towards the end of the mission, after exiting the bar area. Continue down the hallway and take the third door on the left. The chest containing the Colonel Kandler multiplayer skin will be in there. Use the Skeleton Key to open it.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84180339-a8b0-473f-a365-ea98d8523bc1">

#### Ammo Saver

| {% raachpic 253010, 280541, Singapore Sling - Ammo Saver %} | Complete Singapore Sling on normal or greater difficulty without taking any shots. [Mounted weapons excluded] |

In this mission you have to rely on just your melee attack for kills as you will not be given grenades. So much for stealth when you can't fire your weapon. That's fine; this mission isn't too bad anyway. When you first start the mission, you can run up and kill the first two enemies immediately in your view. If you are fast enough, you likely won't have been seen by the other enemies yet, but that won't last long. Up ahead there will be a guard walking back and forth, two guards on the right that we can ignore, and another guard on the left. Kill the guard walking back and forth and then the guard on the left. You will be seen at this point, so continue left towards the crane and trucks; there are several guards in this small area. Luckily we can use the machete to take them all out at once. Behind the truck on the left is a generator covered in a net; see 0:40 in the video below. Approach it and press action to cut the rope and turn the generator on. After a few seconds, a large explosion will go off, killing all the enemies in the area. Afterwards you are free to pick up any needed health and continue to the meetup with Tanaka and Rickshaw.

Get in the rickshaw and trigger the scene until the crash happens and Tanaka talks with the approaching guards. Stay back so the guards don't aggro on you and wait until they walk away. Make your way forward through the streets; don't bother trying to do it stealthily; you will be spotted regardless by the enemies rushing out the door. Kill the guard and enter the room with the save spot; save if necessary. Exiting the room will put you on the streets with four enemies, one of them a swordsman. You can just jump in the ditch and crawl your way to the end of the street, but I recommend just rushing in and killing them. Otherwise, you end up having like seven enemies surrounding you, not to mention the ones on the roof that you can't kill. Make the turn and rush ahead to kill these enemies. Now you are in the town square, and while there is lots to do here on a normal playthrough, we don't care about any of it. Make your way to the north alley, killing the enemies in the middle of the square and the three enemies that pop out as you reach the alley. At the end of the alley is Bromley; follow him into the building.

Listen to Bromley's speech and pick up the medical kit from the small closet, then follow him into the basement. You can either let Bromley take out as many enemies as he can before rushing in to melee the rest, or you can just rush in as he does and kill them. One of the enemies has a machine gun; the others have M1 Garands, but they aren't too hard to take out. Make your way through the basement and back outdoors, following Bromley. Use the caltrops to crash Kandler's car, take his uniform, and make your way to the roofs. There is a save spot here as well that you can take. This section is the hardest part of this achievement: lots of enemies, not much cover, and you will be spotted almost immediately.

The first roof has three enemies and two greenhouses that the enemies can shoot through. I take the right side and kill the swordsman; you will get noticed and immediately shot at afterwards. Ignore the enemies on the left and continue towards the enemies straight ahead. Kill him and cross over to the next root section. There will be three enemies all aligned with each other. Depending on your health, you can go back and kill the enemy we left and search for health pickups. Drop down onto the next roof section and kill these two enemies, then make your way towards the next section with the POW. Kill the two enemies next to the POW and pick up the medical kit. Four enemies left on the roofs, two on the lower section, then another two on the upper section. Pick up the medical kit on the lower section as you make your way through. Make your way into the building, taking out the two unaware guards, and then make your way downstairs to meet up with Tanaka again.

Tanaka will drive "Colonel Kandler" to the hotel so you can infiltrate the Axis Summit. There are several medical kits just lying around in the hotel; pick up any that you need and note the location of any that you might need when you are escaping in a little bit. Arrive at the hotel and make your way to the designated room upstairs and wait until you are discovered. After Bromley breaks in and tosses you a gun, two enemies will barge into the room that you can easily take care of. After grabbing the slide reel, two more enemies will come in; they can easily be taken out as well. Continue out the door; here will be three immediate enemies shooting at you with M1 Garands. Take them out one at a time and pick up the field surgeon pack on the chairs behind the last one to recover full health and continue your way towards the stairs. At the top of the stairs will be three more enemies, one being a swordsman. Take out the gunner first, as he will be closest to you, then focus on the swordsman; remember they do a lot of damage if they slice you. Take either staircase down to the first floor; both sides will have a swordsman with their pistol out, so they aren't much of a threat. Continue behind the stairs towards the two double doors. As you approach them, they will open, and an enemy will be running out of each one; you can ignore them. Go through the doors and immediately turn right and kill the enemy there. Continue through the door to make your way into the kitchen.

Upon entering the kitchen, you can immediately turn left and exit towards the bar, ignoring the three enemies in there. The bar and the final hallway have a lot of enemies, but your good pal Bromley is here to help. If you are feeling daring, you can rush through the bar killing the enemies one by one as you approach them, or you can let Bromley take them out. This goes for the hallway enemies as well; four of them will start running towards the bar as you progress. With Bromley's help, take out these enemies and make your way down the hallway. The door on the left will have two enemies and a field surgeon pack; I recommend going in there for that. The door on the right will also have two enemies you can take out. Poke your head out to the balcony and then go back into the room to initiate the final sequence of the mission. You don't want to stay on the balcony with all those enemies. Wait a few seconds for the mission end to trigger and reap your reward.

### Mission 7: In Search of Yamashita's Gold

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97d2ffc1-7454-4f6c-8195-a51bef27acdc)

| {% raachpic 253001, 280535, In Search of Yamashita's Gold %} | Complete In Search of Yamashita's Gold on normal or greater difficulty. |
| {% raachpic 253002, 280535, In Search of Yamashita's Gold [Hard] %} | Complete In Search of Yamashita's Gold on hard difficulty. |

Before the US officially entered WWII, a small force of volunteer pilots fought for the Chinese against the advancing Japanese invaders. This elite group became known as the Flying Tigers. Eventually, as the US entered the war, the Flying Tigers were mostly absorbed into the 14th Air Force.

This mission is pretty fun, though it can be enemy-heavy in certain areas, making the Service Medal and Ammo Saver achievements pretty challenging to unlock. You start off in the jungle with a couple of allies and Bromley telling you to escape the temple before he blows the fourth anti-aircraft gun. From here you'll come across the usual areas with a handful of enemies that you need to take out. Nothing you haven't seen before in previous missions. There is one section in particular that is pretty unfair, especially on hard mode. This section has four machine gunners as well as what seems like a dozen additional enemies as you are progressing through the area. Learning where to hide and where the health pickups are in this section is a good idea. Afterwards you find the Flying Tigers plane crash and then make your way to the second half of the mission, which takes place in the temple.

Getting into the temple requires you to go through a way of several enemies that can easily catch you off guard. Your goal in the temple is to find the captured pilot and get out of there in time. Don't worry; there is no actual time limit here. The Temple rooms are pretty similar, open rooms with 3-6 enemies in each one, not too tricky. One room in particular, the large outside room with the rocks, can catch you off guard, as there are several swordsmen that can sneak up on you. As usual, make your way through the template, following the mostly linear path to the end of the mission. At the end, take control of the machine gun, take out the explosive barrels, and incoming enemies to complete the mission.

#### Entrenching Tool

| {% raachpic 253015, 280546, Digging Up Some Cheats %} | Find the Entrenching Tool in In Search of Yamashita's Gold. |

Collecting the Entrenching Tool requires two parts: collecting the Lotus Flower and using the flower to open the door containing the Entrenching Tool.

The Lotus Flower can be found in the third main room within the temple. There is a large statue in the middle of the room that is holding the Lotus Flower. Walk up to the statue to collect it.

<img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65b89a76-b95a-4c06-8e25-79fd35e2291d">

After Bromley blows the first antiaircraft gun and you find Yamashita's gold, you need to go downstairs into the detention center to rescue the pilot. Follow the long hallway to the end room with the pedestal and the large statue. Place the Lotus Flower on the pedestal to "achieve enlightenment" and open the door on the right. Enter the door and collect the entrenching tool on the ground. Now you can play previous missions and collect all the cheats.

#### Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal

| {% raachpic 253022, 280553, Asiatic Pacific Campaign %} | Receive the Asiatic Pacific Campaign medal in In Search of Yamashita's Gold. |

The Asiatic Pacific Campaign medal and Skeleton Key is unlocked by completing the mission with the following conditions met:  
 - Both bonus objectives have been complete.  
 - 85% or greater accuracy.  
 - 49 or fewer hits taken.

This mission requires you to get at least 85% accuracy, rather than the typical 75%, which alone isn't that bad using the Springfield for head shots. The real struggle here comes with the hits taken requirement, as there are multiple sections of this map where you are bombarded with enemies and machine gunners. It can be rough at times. There are two main spots in the jungle that can hurt your hit count: the open area with the ramp up to the ledge on the right and the area right after with the four machine gunners. In the first area, take the high ground on the right and snipe as many enemies as you can. The second area is annoying; you can easily take out the first machine gunner, but the second one is a pain. That and the constant stream of enemies running can easily catch you off guard and cause you to take several hits. Be sure to spam grenades here.

The area entering the temple has a bunch of enemies, but they are pretty easy to take out from afar with the Springfield. Be aware of the two machine gunners on either side of the stairs leading to the temple, as well as the three enemies that spawn as you reach the top. Inside the temple are several rooms and hallways with a bunch of enemies, but for the most part they can be taken care of fairly easily either with grenades or poking out from cover to kill them. The room with the Lotus Flower, in particular, can be rough if you don't have any grenades going in. There are 4-5 enemies waiting directly in front of you as you enter, so be sure to toss a grenade or two in there before rushing in to kill the rest of the enemies. Other than that, take it slow, hide behind cover, chuck grenades, and keep your accuracy high. This is one of the more challenging Service Medal achievements, but ultimately not that bad.

The video above shows my run to get this achievement, which ended in 49 hits and 86% accuracy. I took the end extra cautiously to avoid taking that last hit and later realized that the ending sequence starts after blowing up all the explosive barrels.

**Bonus Objective 1: Destroy Japanese Radio Equipment**

In the area with the four machine gunners, within the structure where the third gunner is located, are a couple of boxes alongside the wall. Toss a grenade on top to destroy the Japanese radio equipment and complete this objective.

**Bonus Objective 1: Destroy Officers' Sake Supply**

Throughout the mission there are five sake barrels that you need to destroy. All barrels can be found in the temple before finding Yamashita's gold. The order listed below is the order that you will come across them as you progress through the temple:  
- Barrel 1
    - Enter the temple and go right into the first room filled with enemies. The first sake barrel will be on the right side just as you enter the door.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a720fb0-f547-4819-a4e0-e92068c0fa97">  
- Barrel 2
    - The second sake barrel is in the room with the Lotus Flower behind some roots on the left side just after entering the room.  
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24288b16-6674-4156-b00b-3f7fdafe7e47">  
- Barrel 3
    - In the hallway right after the outside area with the large rocks and swordsman, there is a closed door on the left side. Open the door to find the third sake barrel.  
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae54d188-fef1-4291-82cd-5714bbf34764">  
- Barrel 4
    - The first room after sake barrel three contains several enemies sitting at tables. The fourth sake barrel is on the right just as you enter behind the tables with tablecloths on them.  
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/986ac117-a6fb-48bb-86ee-326a57144b1f">  
- Barrel 5
    - After exiting the previous room, the path splits. Take the right path to the kitchen to find the last sake barrel inside on the left.
    - If you take the left side and discover Yamashita's gold, you will be blocked from going back to collect any missed items.

#### Ammo Saver

Welcome to what I believe to be the hardest achievement in the set. The jungle section has one area in particular that is complete trash to get through. If you've played the mission, then you know exactly which one that is. The transition from the jungle into the temple is difficult as well, with lots of enemies and two machine gunners that can easily kill you. The rooms in the temple can be either easy or hard, depending on the number of grenades you have, so entering the temple with around 10 is pretty important. Otherwise, you are running around in a room trying to melee 5-6 enemies, which is not going to end well for you. Well, let's get started.

Start off in the jungle by ignoring the enemies on the right and continuing down the path on the left. Take out these three enemies, two of which usually drop canteens. If you continue straight towards the trees, you can cut a path with the machete, but I don't recommend it. It just makes three more enemies that you have to kill, so follow the intended path towards the broken pillars, killing the three enemies on the way. Around the bend is an enemy with an automatic weapon and one with an M1 Garand; take care of the auto enemy first. Down the hill will be three enemies. You can chuck a grenade down here to kill them or just rush them and melee them one at a time. One of these enemies will drop a medical kit.

The next section is a fairly large area with a handful of enemies that you can surprisingly run through without taking too many hits. Take the left side to progress and note the canteen in front of the tree on the right and the left in case you need to backtrack for health. Move forward to the left of the pillar in the middle of the area and chuck a grenade towards the machine gunner. As you approach, 3-4 enemies will spawn in behind the gunner. They can be taken out pretty easily with melee attacks. At this point, it's up to you if you want to turn around and take out any remaining enemies in case they drop health pickups. One of the enemies near the gunner typically drops a med kit. When finished, head up the path towards the rocks. Behind the structure is a save point with some boxes. The large box contains a grenade pickup, so keep that in mind. Only pick it up if you have 15 or fewer grenades; you need all the grenades you can get on this mission.

This next section is the first wall, and you will likely die here multiple times in your attempts. The good thing is it only takes 2-3 minutes to get here. Definitely recommend practicing this area and taking note of the gunner locations, enemy spawns, and health pickups. Chuck a grenade at the first gunner before you are spotted. Approach cautiously and start chucking grenades all over the place as the enemies start running in, focusing on the second gunner on the left first. I don't recommend taking control of the first gunner's gun; you'll get wiped out pretty fast if you try that. If you are below 15 grenades and didn't pick up the ones by the save point, go do so. Proceed into the area and towards the gunner station on the left. In front of the broken pillar will be a med kit to help. There will likely still be enemies in the middle of the area that you can toss grenades at, and the gunner in the building will be shooting at you now. After taking some cover near the second gunner, jump over the pillar on the left side and continue forward. Again, don't get on the gunner and try to take out the rest of the enemies; I've found that to be very unsuccessful. Make your way towards the fourth gunner with ideally at least half health. This gunner usually doesn't shoot at you, so you can rush him and melee him. Do not get on this gun either; this will cause about a dozen new enemies to spawn in. Instead, go towards the building gunner and take out the 2-3 enemies in your path. In the building, there are four breakable boxes, two of which have grenades and a med kit. Be sure to pick those up before continuing to the plane crash site. You've gotten past the hardest part, but you're not out of the woods yet.

Continue past the plane crash with Tanaka towards the entrance of the temple. There will be three enemies on the path there. I have found that the first enemy usually drops a med kit, so kill all three, then go back for the med kit so we can enter the next area with full health. You'll need it. As you enter the area, there is one guard pacing back and forth, two machine gunners up high, and, when spotted, several enemies coming down the temple stairs. Run forward, kill the pacing guard, and then head left to take cover behind the tree along the wall. Here you are safe from the gunner and can actually toss a very well-aimed grenade to kill him. Take a small step backwards, aim at the temple spire on the left, and toss a grenade. See the video below or [5:25](https://youtu.be/LA3my4HLA0U?t=325).

![image](https://i.imgur.com/uyFVqP6.gif)

Continue up the left side and turn right to see how many enemies are on the steps and in front of the gunner towers. Depending on the count, you may be able to melee some of the closer ones; just don't go too far right, or the other gunner in the tower will start to shoot at you. One thing to note here is that hiding behind the steps on either side is not as safe as you may think; the enemies can shoot through the walls along the steps. As you make your way up the steps, there will be a couple more enemies that start running down. They can usually be taken care of pretty easily. Make your way to the top of the steps and immediately take cover on either side; there will be three enemies here, one of which is on a machine gun. Toss a grenade in, make sure it takes the gunner out, then rush in and take out the rest of the enemies. The gunner should drop a med kit that you can pick up. You've now completed the second hardest part of this mission. Assuming you have 10 or so grenades, the rest shouldn't be too difficult.

Follow the temple path on the right and take out the enemy patrolling the hallway. Approach the first room, toss in a grenade, and rush in afterwards to clean up the remaining enemies. The next room will have a handful of enemies in it, so you want to toss a grenade or two in there, make sure most enemies are killed, then enter to clean up the rest. Most of the hallways in this temple are all the same, a handful of enemies, and lots of box cover. I don't recommend wasting grenades in the hallways unless there are multiple enemies bunched up. In the last two rooms, you killed about 10 enemies, so be sure to check for any needed health pickups and then continue down the hallway. After killing the three enemies, approach the closed door. If you don't have any grenades at this point, well, good luck. You are probably going to die. As you open the door, there will be four enemies immediately in front of you shooting as well as 2-3 others scattered in the room. Toss a grenade in and take cover to take them out. Poke your head out and toss in another if you need to; otherwise, rush in and go left to take out the enemy next to the sake barrel. Run around the room to take out the remaining enemies. The hallway on the left leads to a save point as well as breakable boxes with more grenades. Be sure to pick those up.

Open up the double doors in the main room (with the big statue) and proceed down the hallway, killing the two enemies you see. The next turn in the hallway will have several enemies. I recommend using a couple of grenades here to take out as many as you can. If you are left with just one or two, then you can easily just melee them. Continue through the hallway to the outside room with the rocks. This room has two enemies up on the balcony on each side that you can just leave alone; it's not worth wasting grenades on. This room also has several swordsman enemies, so be careful as you make your way through. I recommend just hugging the left side wall and making sure you are checking your back; it's pretty easy for a swordsman to sneak up on you. Continue through the room towards the next hallway, breaking the boxes before you get there to pick up some more grenades. The door on the left can be opened, and the boxes inside broken to get a canteen pickup if needed. Continue forward to the next set of doors and open them. In here will be a few enemies sitting at a table that you can chuck grenades at. Rush in to clean the rest up and continue forward, taking the left path, triggering the first anti-aircraft explosion, and the finding of Yamashita's gold.

Follow the walkway towards the detention center, taking out the two shovel enemies on the way. There will be three enemies coming up the detention center ramp that you can chuck a grenade at before heading down. As you make your way down, two more enemies will approach you; just melee them and continue forward. Take out the next enemy in the hallway and toss a grenade in the first room on the left; one of the enemies in here has a machine gun. Rush in afterwards to clear the room. Enter the room on the right to free the pilot; you can melee these two enemies without any problem. Free the pilot and make your way back out of the detention center. If you have the Skeleton Key, it's worth going into the room with the multiplayer skin, as it has 10 grenades and a med kit. At the exit of the detention center gate, there are two enemies; you can either rush them or toss a grenade and proceed up the ramp. Back in the gold room, there will be two enemies that you can toss a grenade at before continuing forward.

Continue through the hallway towards the room with the large statue that breaks. Surprisingly, you can be killed pretty quickly in this room if you are not careful. Toss a couple of grenades towards the enemies in the middle, as well as over the broken head, to kill any on the other side and make your way through the room. You're in the home stretch. Make your way down the next couple of hallways, taking cover when you need to and using up the rest of your grenades as you go. The room at the end has three enemies that are easy to take out. After all the enemies are cleared out, take control of either mounted machine gun. Aim for the explosive barrels on the ground and in the towers, then aim for all the enemies running around. Shortly after, the mission will be completed, and you'll have this achievement unlocked.

On hard mode, this achievement took about an hour and a half, with most of the deaths coming from either the jungle section with all the gunners or the entrance to the temple.

### Mission 8: A Bridge on the River Kwai

| {% raachpic 253004, 280536, A Bridge on the River Kwai [Hard] %} | Complete A Bridge on the River Kwai on hard difficulty. |

The Japanese Army used massive amounts of POW labor to construct critical supply routes throughout Southeast Asia. These rail lines were critical to support and maintain the Japanese troops in these areas; however, they were vulnerable to attack by highly mobile Allied forces operating deep behind enemy lines.

This mission is pretty fun and relatively easy. The most difficult part is the elephant ride towards the end of the mission. You start off by parachuting into the Burmese jungle near the River Kwai with the ultimate goal of obtaining proof of Commander Shima's plan and discovering the final destination of the gold. As you progress through the jungle, you'll be bombarded by enemy forces, both up high on the rocks and down low in the foxholes. As you make your way through the jungle, you'll rendezvous with Chindits and continue along the rail line. Shortly after, you get to take a ride on an elephant while arming a machine gun to take out enemy troops. All leading up to the bridge over the River Kwai. As Shima's train is crossing, it's your job to stop it and complete the mission. Make your way through the train car chaos to meet with Bromley, find Shima's proof, and escape by jumping off the bridge.

#### Bronze Star Service Medal

| {% raachpic 253023, 280554, Bronze Star %} | Receive the Bronze Star medal in A Bridge on the River Kwai. |

The Bronze Star Medal and Skeleton Key is unlocked by completing the mission with the following conditions met:  
- Both bonus objectives have been complete.  
- 85% or greater accuracy.  
- 89 or fewer hits taken.

This Service Medal achievement is not that difficult. While the threshold for accuracy rises to at least 85%, the threshold for hits taken also rises to at most 90 hits taken. So there is a bit of a tradeoff, but hits taken is always the more difficult threshold to make, so the tradeoff is in your favor. You can use well-aimed Springfield shots from a distance to keep your accuracy high throughout the mission. There are a couple of sections where you get ambushed by several enemies that can do some real damage on the hit count, but some grenades tossed at a distance can make these sections much easier. When you get to the rail line, you want to make sure you take the path up the rock foundation; it's much easier to take out the enemies up top that way. After meeting up with Chindits and continuing along the rail line, you will come across alternating rock cover formations that will spawn several enemies each. As long as you chuck some grenades behind each one and blow up the explosive barrels, you will have less enemies to deal with. Complete the blockade and barge bonus objectives and then make your way to where the elephant is. This section can be tricky because of how jittery the elephant's movement is and the couple of enemies in the tree that are very difficult to spot. Recommend practicing this section a few times to learn the enemy spawn locations before trying out a full run for this achievement. The rest of the mission is a cakewalk: derail the train, find Bromley, and jump off the exploding bridge. Just be sure to keep track of your accuracy and hit counts throughout the mission.

**Bonus Objective 1: Eliminate 10 Guards at the Blockade**

After meeting up with Chindit, follow the tracks to the blockade with the two watch towers. Eliminate 10 enemies at the blockade to complete this objective.

**Bonus Objective 2: Disable Barge Dock**

After reaching the blockade, continue down the path to the left until you reach a small bridge. In the water below on the right side is a barge with multiple enemies and explosive barrels. Shoot the the barrels to complete this objective.

#### Ammo Saver

| {% raachpic 253012, 280543, A Bridge on the River Kwai - Ammo Saver %} | Complete A Bridge on the River Kwai on normal or greater difficulty without taking any shots. [Mounted weapons excluded] |

Much like the Service Medal achievement, this one is fairly easy with a couple of tricky parts. After starting the mission, immediately turn around and use the machete to find the secret path. Continue forward and melee the enemies in your way. Before swinging on the vine into the cave, you can break the box to get a med kit; you should be at nearly full health. Take out the enemies in the cave and the enemies outside the cave on the tree limb with a couple grenades. Look towards the rail line for the four enemies and chuck some grenades at them to take care of them. Hop off the edge and break the large box up the small ramp for some health if you need it; otherwise, progress towards the rail line. When you reach the rail line, toss a grenade to the left by the boxes to take out the couple of enemies there. Head to the right off the rail line path and take out the two enemies that pop out of the foxholes. Proceed up the trail past the mounted machine gun, don't use the gun otherwise several enemies will spawn in and charge at you. Take out the two enemies at the top of the hill and push the boulder to destroy the truck and a few enemies below. Collect the med kit up here and make your way down the trail towards Chidits.

Continue down the rail line with Chindits and crew and enter the cave on the right. While you are not required to go in here, I recommend it as there is a grenade pickup and a field surgeon pack, so you should leave with full health. Continue down the rail line until you come across one of Chindits' men next to three boxes; break the middle box for another grenade pickup. This next section has four rock formations that alternate on either side of the rail line. Behind each is a couple of enemies and an explosive barrel. You'll want to throw a grenade behind each formation from a distance to blow up the barrel before getting too close; otherwise, the enemies will run out at you. Approach the turn in the rail line and make your way cautiously past the rock formations towards the blockade. We don't care about the blockade, so ignore the enemies and continue past it on the left path.

Continue down the path, taking out the two foxhole enemies, and make your way across the small bridge above the barge. Before you reach the two enemies on the mounted gun, toss a grenade to take them out. As you walk forward, six enemies will charge in from behind you. Common instinct would be to get on the gun and mow them down, but that's not the best approach. You can easily just melee the enemies one by one as they run at you without the worry of taking any damage. Within the boxes is a med kit that you can pick up if you need it. Welcome to the elephant section. Before getting on the elephant, go behind it and cut the tree to reveal a path leading to more health and a grenade pickup. This elephant section can be a bit janky, and on hard mode, it can easily kill you if you get behind or miss taking out certain enemies. Recommend practicing it a few times to make sure you know where each of the tree enemies are as well as which enemies have machine guns, so you can prioritize them first. When ready, hop on the elephant and start shooting.

After getting off the elephant, you meet up with your pal Bromley. Take the path to the right and kill the two enemies on the cliff edge and pick up some health, then head up the left path to the main train tracks and bridge. Run through the open area past the two guard towers and up the path to the crane. Kill the enemy up here and use the crane to derail the incoming train. Pick up the med kit and make your way back down towards the wreckage. Toss a couple of grenades at the first train car door before getting too close. As you approach it, the door will open and several enemies will start running out. The preemptive grenades should take several of them out. Not much else to say about this section; the enemies are usually in packs of two or three. The only section of real concern is the final fuel tank; there is a pack of four enemies there that can bum rush you. A well-placed grenade can make quick work of them. Or if you're like me, a poorly placed grenade can almost blow yourself up. Anyways, make your way through the bridge, opening the fuel tanks, taking out the enemies, finding Bromley, and back to the final last train car, where you make your jump off the bridge and into unlocking this achievement.

The Ammo Saver achievement is completed in the first video of this mission section. Reference that video for how I completed this achievement.

### Mission 9: Supercarrier Sabotage

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f851ad5e-8c25-496d-a09a-880eca4d745f)

| {% raachpic 253005, 280537, Supercarrier Sabotage %} | Complete Supercarrier Sabotage on normal or greater difficulty. |
| {% raachpic 253006, 280537, Supercarrier Sabotage [Hard] %} | Complete Supercarrier Sabotage on hard difficulty. |

Japan was quick to grasp that aircraft carriers, not battleships, were the key to domination of the Pacific. However, combat losses were high, especially in pivotal battles like Midway, where four carriers were lost. In response, Japan started a program of supercarriers with armored decks, theoretically able to withstand external damage far better than normal carriers.

The final mission of the game. You goal here is to sabotage the carrier by opening all the circulations vents below deck and then opening the fuel valves on the engineering deck. We tag up with our good pal Bromley for a final mission and unfortunately say goodbye to a good friend as well during this mission. This mission is split into pre and post capture sections, with the latter being the more difficult because of the larger rooms and higher enemy counts. Overall, this mission isn't not too difficult. Enjoy playing and taking down the Supercarrier.

#### Silver Star Service Medal

| {% raachpic 253024, 280555, Silver Star %} | Receive the Silver Star medal in Supercarrier Sabotage. |

The Silver Star Medal and Skeleton Key is unlocked by completing the mission with the following conditions met:  
- Both bonus objectives have been complete.  
- 50% or greater accuracy.  
- 149 or fewer hits taken.

Surprisingly, for being the last mission in the game, this is one of the easier Service Medal achievements. You are given a lot of room for error with a required accuracy of only 50% and no more than 149 hits taken. You are only given machine guns in this mission, so be careful not to go crazy when shooting; otherwise, your accuracy could take a hit. On top of that, you are not given any grenades, so melee and shooting are your only options to take out enemies. The only real enemies of concern are wearing full blue uniforms carrying a T-99. They can tack on a bunch of hits and do a lot of damage if you are not careful around them; prioritize taking them out first when possible. If you are concerned about your accuracy, you can cheese one of the enemies in the gold room, allowing you to shoot at him indefinitely, raising your accuracy without doing any damage to the enemy. You can see this briefly in my video. The second half of the mission, after being captured, is by far the harder section. The large open hangars, crowded walkways, and jam-packed enemies can be hard to take out without sacrificing taking several. But realistically, as long as you play somewhat carefully, you should be fine on the hit count. The end of the mission involves you and Bromley escaping the carrier by plane. You can still take hits during this escape sequence, about 5-7, so shoot the planes around you if you are too close to 150 total hits.

**Bonus Objective 1: Send False Radio Transmission**

After collecting the second Imperial Orders from the operations room, make your way upstairs to the next floor. The first room on the left will contain radio equipment. Press action on the equipment to complete this objective.

<br><br>

**Bonus Objective 2: Imperial Orders Found**

Throughout the mission there are three Imperial Orders that you need to collect. The order listed below is the order that you will come across them as you progress through the carrier:

- Imperial Order 1
    - After entering the second large hanger, make your way to the control room in the center that contains the hanger door controls. In this room on the table is the first set of Imperial Orders.
    - <img align="center" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba94abfe-13bf-4172-a170-58af8f9e0237">
- Imperial Order 2
    - After reentering the carrier after completing the two large hangers, after going up the second set of steps you will come across the operations room. In this room is a large table with a map of the battlegrounds and little yellow ships. On the corner of the table is the second set of Imperial Orders.

- Imperial Order 3
    - After collecting the second Imperial Orders from the operations room, make your way upstairs to the next floor. At the end of this floor is a table with the final set of Imperial Orders.

#### Ammo Saver

| {% raachpic 253013, 280544, Supercarrier Sabotage - Ammo Saver %} | Complete Supercarrier Sabotage on normal or greater difficulty without taking any shots. [Mounted weapons excluded] |

This achievement is pretty difficult, easily one of the hardest in the set. The mission throws enemies at you at every turn, and getting caught off guard can easily end your run. Luckily, this mission also has tons of health drops, which will be very important in this mission more than others. It's important to know where these drops are, as you will need to backtrack to collect them at certain points throughout the mission. The large hangars and paths between them outside the carrier are very difficult to navigate without taking a lot of damage. The lack of grenades this mission makes it even more difficult to handle the spread-out enemies. Going into these sections without nearly full health is oftentimes a big mistake. No worries, I'll outline where the useful health picks are and some strategies on navigating through this enemy-packed mission.

Start the mission and make your way downstairs; note the med kit at the top of the steps. Go into the first room on the left, kill the guard, and open the first vent; there is a med kit on the ground in this room as well. Exit the room and continue down the hall past the first set of boxes; here will be a few enemies that you can melee. The box nearest the corner on the right has a med kit if you need it. At the beginning of the next hallway section is a small box with a canteen in it. Rush forward and charge towards the blue enemies with the T-99 and take him out; take the two enemies behind him out afterwards. If you complete this section and rush towards the next vent fast enough, some of the enemies will not spawn in. If they do, you can easily take them out. Remember, you have passed several med kits already that you can backtrack to collect if you need to. After opening the second vent, continue down the hallway. If you want, you can go into the closed door on the right. It has a few enemies but also has two med kits. The enemies inside aren't hard to kill if you go around the bunk beds rather than through the middle of them. Continue down the hallway, noting the room on the left with the med kit inside. Make your way to the cafeteria and open the third vent, killing the enemies in there along the way. The room across the side hall has two swordsmen and a med kit, and the room across from the side hall has some sushi and a med kit. Make your way through the rest of the hall to the room with the fourth vent, open it, and continue forward.

Before going downstairs, you can open the door at the top of the steps to reveal a save spot and a field surgeon pack. Make your way down the stairs, killing the enemies, and into the large room with the fuel tanks. Go left and make your way across the catwalk; there will be two enemies here. The best thing to do is just rush them and then take a right off the catwalk to collect the med kit sitting there. Continue forward to clear out the rooms on the right side. Both had a vent to open and a control box to destroy. The room on the left also has a med kit. Make your way to the other set of rooms on the other side, breaking the four fuel values on the way. Clear out the last two rooms and grab the med kit in the right room. Approach the broken fuel valves until Bromley starts to come in and set up the explosives. When he starts talking, make your way to the gold room. You want to be well in front of him; otherwise, the three enemies with the T-99s will give you a rough time. If you are well in front of Bromley, you can catch the enemies as they enter the room and melee them one by one. There is a med kit at the end of the walkway before the gold room that you can pick. I recommend having full health before entering the gold room, so backtrack to get health. You can't take damage in the gold room, so enter when ready and get captured.

Get ready for the hard part. You're tied up, and Shima is now interrogating you and Bromley. At the end of the scene (fare thee well Private Tanaka, you were one of the good ones), melee the two guards that rush into the room. If you follow Bromley into the next room, there will be two field surgeon packs in there, but you have full life already, like I told you to be, so don't grab these. The game does create an autosave point here, so if you die, it's not that big of a deal; the achievement will still be active. Anyways, make your way up to the first hangar and run forward towards the two enemies by the explosive barrels. Melee them both and then break the box next to the right explosive barrel for a med kit. Turn around and go towards the two enemies in the corner; you should have enough health to melee at least one of them. You are probably pretty low on health at this point, though, so make your way back to the starting room and pick up one of the field surgeon packs. Make your way back to the hangar and take out the rest of the enemies; be careful of the T-99 enemies that come in from the outside path. Proceed outside and melee the first two enemies you see; as long as you have 1/3 health, you will be fine. On the elevated section where the second enemy was, there are multiple boxes. Two of them have med kits, and one has a field surgeon pack; make sure you pick up one of them and then continue down the other side. Rush the three enemies and melee them. As long as you are quick enough, the two T-99 gunners won't have much time to even shoot at you. Watch out for the T-99 gunner on the next level up; you can't reach him yet, but he can certainly shoot you.

The next hangar is even bigger, but there are several health drops and not too many enemies to deal with. Enter in from the first door, head towards the left side of the hangar, and melee any enemies that are close by. At the very end of the hangar by the large door is a set of boxes with a med kit. On the opposite side of the control room is another set of boxes with a field surgeon pack and a net that can be cut to reveal two more field surgeon packs. Make your way around the hangar and kill the rest of the enemies, and then take out the two enemies in the control room; both of them will drop. Open the hangar doors and approach the next hangar section. The set of boxes to the left of the now-opened door has a med kit. Go into the next room and kill the three enemies in there and then proceed up the stairs. This next outside section can be tough as well, but you should have several health pickups in the previous rooms that you can backtrack to pick up when necessary. Outside the door is one enemy that will very likely hit you; take the hit and kill him. Up the stairs are two more enemies that you will probably take another hit on, but they aren't too bad to take out. The next lower section has three enemies, with the far one being a T-99 gunner. If you don't have at least 3/4 health, then go backtrack to pick some up. Make your way down the steps and prioritize the T-99 gunner, taking one of the other enemies out along the way. Before making your way up the next set of stairs, make sure you have nearly full health; you don't want to get this far and then die. Proceed up the stairs towards the enemies and take out the first two. The third enemies will be near the two large boxes, both of which have canteens in them that you can pick up. The last enemies are near the next set of large boxes. Take all of them out and make your way towards the entrance back into the carrier. Two more enemies will come out the door and hide behind the boxes in the way, but they are easy to take out. Make your way back inside the carrier. Congrats, you've gotten past the hardest part, but you're not out of the woods yet.

Make your way up the stairs and immediately turn left and make your way around the hallway. Take out the enemies in your way and continue forward; note the field surgeon pack in the small dining room. Make your way upstairs again and take caution as you enter the operations room. Down the hall are two T-99 enemies that will immediately start shooting at you and can easily kill you if you are not careful. Run into the bathroom on the right to take cover; note the field surgeon pack in here. Pop out and rush the two enemies; if you can take them both out, great; if you are taking too much damage, retreat back into the bathroom and collect the health. Continue through the rest of this floor with caution; there are three more T-99 enemies hiding around the corners. Afterwards, make your way upstairs and into the room with the radio equipment, killing the swordsman in here. The next several enemies are all swordsmen, who will all drop canteens, so be careful not to get caught off guard by any running around the column. Take them all out and continue forward through the mission. There are only four more enemies left, two steering the carrier and two outside before you get to the plane. No real danger with them; take them all out and escape with Bromley to complete the mission and unlock this achievement.

## Multiplayer

For all the multiplayer achievements, you are forced to play against the best CPUs and be paired up with the worst. I'm not going into detail on best strategies for each map on each gamemode in this section, because it's really not needed. It you want the easy way to unlock these achievements then play with "Collateral Damage" as the weapon set. The CPUs are very dumb, even the 4 stars, they will often kill themselves or their team members with this weapon set. Making coming in first in both Free For All and Team Deathmatch fairly easy with the achievement restrictions.

Each map has two achievements, one for Free For All and one for Team Deathmatch, for a total of 18 achievements. at 10 minutes a match (minimum), unlocking all of these multiplayer achievements will take at least 3 hours. There is a bit of repetition here, but as someone who has put hundreds of hours into multiplayer over the years with friends and family, I think it deserves to be enjoyed by everyone. Plus the multiplayer in this Medal of Honor game is actually very good.
