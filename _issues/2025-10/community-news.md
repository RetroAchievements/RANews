## RA Awards

The 5th annual RA Awards has started. The RA Awards are the community's opportunity to highlight their favorite sets, developers, contributors, and community members from the prior year. Check out the `# rawards-discussion` and `#rawards-voting` channels in Discord for more details.

## Hash Compatibility Testing

The QA-team is happy to announce a new process for hash compatibility testing! This allows users to help test hash compatibility for existing sets. You can work with the developer on testing new hashes while mastering the set to verify compatibility. Below are some of the recently linked hashes. 

| Game                                       | Console     | Hash Type           | Tester                    | Link Date    |

## Site Updates

### RAWeb 2025.09.09
**Highlights for Players**
- All email notifications now have unsubscribe links in the footer.
- The Catalan language is now available, thanks to @Puniasterus . You can set your language/locale on your settings page.
- As preparation for multiset, subsets are no longer factored into your average completion percentage.

**Highlights for Developers**
- Server errors that were appearing when configuring claims have been resolved.
- We've fixed a data issue that might have occurred when deleting code notes.

Additionally, there are a few UI changes you might notice elsewhere.

[Full release notes here](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/releases/tag/2025.09.08)

### RAWeb 2025.09.24
This release opens our new game page beta to everyone. To enable the beta, navigate to your settings page and flip the new "Enable beta features" toggle.

Once enabled, all game links will automatically route to the new page instead of the legacy view.

We've built a lightweight in-page feedback button that appears after you've used the beta for a bit. Your comments submitted on this will go straight to the team (please be nice!).

If you were using the page while in alpha, you'll notice some upgrades right away in this release: your current leaderboard rank shows on the Leaderboards view, you can sort achievements by the set's original display order even after you've unlocked some, and the mobile layout is cleaner with a compact header.

Please give the new page a spin and let us know what feels right (and what doesn't). We'll continue to make changes as we collect feedback through this form.

**Highlights for Players**
- You can now opt in to the new game page beta on your settings page.
- Subset achievement unlocks are now again included in your 'Achievements unlocked' statistic total.

**Highlights for Developers**
- Sending messages from team inboxes will now also forward those replies to Discord forum threads.
- The "Ends at" date on events pages no longer messes up when 24 hours still remain in an event.
- We've made additional tweaks to email notification subscriptions related to explicit opt-out.
- You can now delete most of your own credit entries in the management app.
- You can now view and edit game RP scripts on the game management pages.

[Full release notes here](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/releases/tag/2025.09.24)

### RAWeb 2025.09.29
This is a patch release for the beta game page, addressing some of the feedback we've already received.

**Reminder: to enable the beta, navigate to your settings page and flip the new "Enable beta features" toggle.**

**New Features**
- How leaderboards are selected has been redesigned based on community feedback. The leaderboard count is now always shown, and you can access leaderboards in a single click.
- When viewing unpublished achievements, you'll now see the points totals for all the unpublished achievements.
- We've repositioned and restyled the mobile "scroll to top" button.

**Bug Fixes**
- Mobile scrolling won't "freeze up" anymore when you accidentally start scrolling from the achievement sort button.
- On mobile, clicking the "View Unpublished Achievements" button will now automatically take you to the achievements tab.
- LibreWolf users should no longer see achievements and leaderboards mysteriously disappear from the page.
- Email notifications that link to a comment should work correctly now.
- The count for number of open tickets should now be correct.

We're still working on a handful of adjustments based on user feedback we continue to receive. We're aware of a few known issues (such as missing links to developer tools) and expect these things to be resolved in subsequent patches.
