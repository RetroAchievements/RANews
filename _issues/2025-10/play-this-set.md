## Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales (Nintendo DS)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Console     | Genre                                                                                                                                                                     |

As a child, you just end up with random games for the consoles you play because of the cute cover, or because your parents thought you might like it. A lot of the time, these games are bottom of the barrel shovelware, but sometimes they are true gems, like Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales.

This game sees you playing as an adorable chibi chocobo, playing inventive and fun minigames and microgames to progress in the RPG story. You also play a card game called Pop-Up Duels, which actually has some in-depth strategy to the deck building and construction. This hidden gem in an enormous series deserves a lot more love, and I hope that you enjoy it and share the love I have for it.

[Final Fantasy](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7221) is a series that needs no introduction. You have very likely played at least one game in the series. You have most definitely heard about it. My history with the series is a bit all over the place, having played many but certainly not all main entries. One that I was missing was exactly this game, the one that started it all (or well, one of its multiple ports/remakes/collections/etc...). I had always been curious about FF1, especially since joining RA and realizing that it is such a beloved game. Just look at all the crazy subsets there are, like [Solo Class](https://retroachievements.org/game/5582) playthroughs, or completing the game with [every single possible party combination](https://retroachievements.org/game/28594). However, I had always been put off by the original [NES version](https://retroachievements.org/game/1449), mainly because of the way it looks (I find the battle menus hard to follow) and the knowledge that it didn't have auto-targeting, which makes the playstyle very different to other JRPGs, while also making the game less fast-forward friendly. 

Well, I'm glad to tell you that this version of the game solves both of those issues! Final Fantasy on the WonderSwan Color is a graphically beautiful remake, making the visuals more similar to those found in the SNES/GBA games. It also has the option to toggle auto-targeting on or off at any point from the options menu. And to put the cherry on top, this set is perfect as an introduction to FF1, showing you all the basics and offering a few fair challenges, while still maintaining mastery possible with a single playthrough.

As a game, Final Fantasy is surprisingly fun. It's also short and sweet. Treat it like a dungeon crawler, and you'll never feel the need to grind. You'll naturally progress in levels the further you venture from the safety of towns. I do recommend you use maps, though, because the dungeons/caves can get pretty labyrinthine in this game.

One point that I need to criticize about this specific version is the translation, though. Being a Japan-only release, we have to rely on a translation patch to play it in English, and sadly, this translation is incomplete. There's enough translated text that you can know what your abilities do and where you need to go, but you might find yourself fumbling a bit with the menus or wondering about the specifics of what some items do.

The set itself is really good. As mentioned before, it does a great job of guiding you through the game as a beginner, and it offers some genuinely fun, not too tough challenges. They might require a bit of planning ahead, but nothing too complicated. In particular, you'll want to go with a party that leans more on physical attacks so you have an easier time with the two no-magic achievements. When I was done with the set, my total playtime was slightly under 10 hours (in-game time was obviously much higher).

All in all, I can wholeheartedly recommend checking out this set if you've ever been interested in trying out FF1. It serves as a great starting point, and it has certainly gotten me interested in trying out other versions of the game, even the original NES release! One day I might even find myself chipping away at those colossal subsets. And if you're already a veteran of FF1, then you'll find here a chill mastery with great graphics to boot!

## \~Hack~ Mario in the Multiverse (Nintendo 64)

Mario in the Multiverse is a collab romhack, similar to Dog Collab, where multiple creators work together to make one big romhack and show off their skills. It features Mario traveling around different game universes, ranging from Kirby to 007. You also get unique abilities to help you in your adventure that fit the theme of the world where you got them, which I think is really sweet. It also features Pizza Tower, one of my favorite games. Another reason why I like this hack is that it's made by rovertronic, who is my favorite hack creator in recent years due to amazing stuff he has been able to create with the Mario 64 engine like TROLLAB and Mario Builder 64. I really hope this gets more people to play the hack, as it's not as popular on RetroAchievements, with only 71 people mastering the game, including myself.

## Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure (Nintendo DS)

Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure is a remarkable Nintendo DS game that combines 2D platforming with…[Tetris Attack](https://retroachievements.org/game/815)? Yes, you heard that right — this game makes you play two different genres essentially at the same time! And, if I may say so myself, it works surprisingly well.

The game makes clever use of the DS's dual screens. On the top screen, you have your classic 2D platforming action, while the bottom screen hosts a puzzle element that plays exactly like Tetris Attack (also known as [Panel de Pon](https://retroachievements.org/game/3351) or [Pokémon Puzzle League](https://retroachievements.org/game/10270)/[Challenge](https://retroachievements.org/game/726)). Match three or more blocks of the same color in a row, and boom — they disappear!

Of course, you're not managing both gameplay styles at once the entire time. You typically switch between screens: platforming on the top, and solving puzzles on the bottom. Clearing blocks on the bottom screen can occasionally grant you power-ups, healing items, or 1-Ups. More importantly, it generates energy that you use to access your gentleman suit, which gives you more health — or, if you save up enough, your mech suit, which acts like an ultimate ability in the game.

Let me say this in advance: this game is not easy! I picked it up for fun because it piqued my interest, but I didn’t expect something so close to Dark Souls in difficulty.

Nearly every level includes an enemy arena segment, where you have to brawl through waves of monsters. As you progress, the enemies get tougher. Sure, you can power up as well, but if you want to survive the late-game enemy swarms, you'll need to improve.

The boss fights are by far the toughest parts of the game, especially the final boss. They're not unbeatable, but each has a unique moveset that you’ll need to study and learn. Defeating them is a rewarding challenge. However, don’t go into this game casually if you're not ready for that level of difficulty.

The RetroAchievements set for this game adds even more experimental challenges and secrets that are easy to miss during a casual playthrough. In fact, I’d say that mastering the entire set is an achievement in and of itself. If you're into tough, time-consuming challenges, you’ll definitely enjoy Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure — a true "hidden gem" in the vast sea of Nintendo DS titles.

## Space Invaders Extreme 2 (Nintendo DS)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Console     | Genre                                                 |

[Space Invaders](https://retroachievements.org/game/12526) is a game that nearly everyone has played in one way or another. It started off as an arcade game in the 70s and has been ported to consoles, appliances, and even some professional medical equipment. Most of these ports largely keep the original gameplay intact, sometimes adding new gameplay elements or powerups. However, Space Invaders Extreme 2 is a complete re-envisioning of the core gameplay mechanics designed to get your heart pumping along with a killer soundtrack.

The game features a number of different powerups that temporarily boost your firepower as a reward for targeting enemies of the same color. The bottom screen has the main enemies you need to destroy, while the top screen features a bonus area where you can destroy enemies for bonus points and modes. Do well enough and you’ll enter Fever mode, where you can really rack up the points.

The set is very difficult, largely because of how many different time and score attack modes the game features. Pushing for high ranks may drive you mad, but even just a casual playthrough of score attack mode is worth checking out. The game has no masteries (yet), but rest assured, the first person to do so will be a true master of Space Invaders.

## Suikoden Tactics (PlayStation 2)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Console       | Genre                                                  |

The [Suikoden](https://retroachievements.org/hub/5381) franchise is one of the best JRPG series out there, featuring excellent approaching game mechanics with deep narratives filled with politics, intrigue, desperation, and a fight for revolution. When asked, a typical fan will usually gush about [II](https://retroachievements.org/game/11241), [III](https://retroachievements.org/game/2609), or [V](https://retroachievements.org/game/2621). They might off-hand mention [I](https://retroachievements.org/game/11255) (or gush about it like I would), and typically insult IV.

I rarely see Suikoden Tactics talked about, and that's a shame! A strategy JRPG spin-off of the maligned Suikoden IV, it's actually a sequel set a few years AFTER IV. Considering the entire mainline series is in one world, on one timeline, but the main games take place years apart, having an actual sequel focused on the same region with many returning characters is rewarding for those who enjoy the narrative, world-building, and lore of the series.

The gameplay of Tactics is largely standard fare for strategy RPGs; if you've played any in the genre ([Final Fantasy Tactics](https://retroachievements.org/game/11246), [Vandal Hearts](https://retroachievements.org/hub/3363), [Tactics Ogre](https://retroachievements.org/hub/10856), [Onimusha Tactics](https://retroachievements.org/game/5311), [Saiyuki: Journey West](https://retroachievements.org/game/1159)), you'll have a good idea what you're getting into. Tactics adds in some of its own particular flavor, such as elemental floor tiles based on the five main elements in Suikoden. Each is weak to one and strong to another, adding an extra layer of who you move and where to. Someone with an innate Fire element will get stronger and gradually heal while standing on Fire tiles, but become weaker and take damage on Water ones.

If you've played Suikoden IV, you'll find that the plot inside helps to not only explain aspects of that game's story in a better light, but also fills in blanks and enriches what is there. Having a large cast of returning characters and more space to expand on matters unspoken is a gift many games and series don't get a chance to have!

As for the achievement set itself, it's a doozy at 269 of them. Unfortunately, the author of the set has left the building as it were, but filled the set with dozens of missable achievements for replay challenges. Luckily, Tactics happens to have a New Game+ feature, so on the off-chance that you miss something and don't have a back-up save, AND the achievements allow them, you should be able to get everything eventually.

A spin-off sequel to the black sheep of a series is a weird game to be advocating for, but I definitely feel that Tactics would be worth someone's time if they enjoy the genre and want more to cut their teeth on. Every game in this series deserves more love, not just II, and I think Tactics is worth a look!

## Monster Rancher Advance 2 (Game Boy Advance)

Are you a fan of training simulations like Umamusume: Pretty Derby or [Gallop Racer](https://retroachievements.org/game/16246), timed battles, cool monster sprites, and, most importantly for some out there, over 1,500 points? Well, if even a few of those were a yes, Monster Rancher Advance 2 may be the game for you. [Monster Rancher](https://retroachievements.org/hub/5320) as a franchise has the player shrine a monster (this time with an inputting character system), take them to a ranch, and then plot your week-by-week drills and activities from the start of a monster's lifespan to the end of it. As you slowly get a stronger monster, you'll find yourself going from the humble beginnings of E Rank to the pinnacle of the Major 4 and Emperor Cup in S rank.

Monster Rancher Advance 2 is a great starting point for newcomers over some of the other games in the franchise due to the coaching system. You'll never feel like you wasted a monster's lifespan when you can use them after retirement to help train your next monsters. Along with that, the linked [RAGuide](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki/Monster-Rancher-Advance-2-(Game-Boy-Advance)) to the game gives you just about any tip you might need for each achievement unlock.

## Panic in Nakayoshi World (SNES/Super Famicom)

I think my initial playthrough of the game could best be described as "confusion", probably because this is a Japan-exclusive game with a fan translation from an era you were expected to read the manual to get it.

To quickly summarize the game, it features various well-known characters from the Nakayoshi manga magazine of that time. Most people will probably only recognize [Sailor Moon](https://retroachievements.org/hub/4452), of course. Throughout each of the 5 worlds, you'll be tasked with protecting a character from each series while engaging in what might be best described as [Bomberman](https://retroachievements.org/hub/10312) style gameplay, breaking blocks and killing enemies. Just instead of bombs, you have various cutesy ranged blasts. Your general goal is to either kill all the enemies, or to kill only most of them for a door to appear, which you can take your current damsel in distress or prince in peril through to finish the level instead.

The game has a bit of a balancing act between just taking your protectee with you, making you unable to pass through most non-destructible obstacles and possibly putting them in danger (which, if they do get got, not only do you lose a life, the stage restarts). As opposed to leaving them alone, and eventually being greeted by the most annoying crying sound since baby Mario.

Throughout the game, you'll find various power-ups, the most important of which is the strengthening of your magical shots in just about every aspect. With the fully upgraded shot, you can just shred through most obstacles and enemies with little care, but dying does lead to gradually losing these power-ups. This is to say, dying is bad and will greatly affect the difficulty of the game. That said, you have unlimited continues, and the game is built around stages being reasonable to complete with no upgrades, as ultimately, it's not very hard overall. Bosses might end up somewhat lengthy without upgrades, but if you do use a continue against them, the game will take you back to the preceding bonus stage to hopefully bolster your shots before trying again.

All in all, I wouldn't necessarily call it a "hidden gem" of the SNES library, but it's a fun afternoon snack featuring bright and cheery graphics and characters from old manga you probably don't even know. Why is there a pink goldfish? Your guess is as good as mine; just roll with it!

## Dig Dug: Digging Strike (Nintendo DS)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Console     | Genre                                            |

You ever wake up in the middle of the night and ask yourself, “man, why didn’t [Namco](https://retroachievements.org/hub/1202) ever make a Dig Dug 3”? It turns out that they did.

Between the 5th and 6th generations, the [Mr. Driller](https://retroachievements.org/hub/9895) series became a spiritual successor to the [Dig Dug](https://retroachievements.org/hub/1226) series, culminating with lore connecting the two with them being revealed to be father and son in the Japan-exclusive game Mr. Driller: Drill Land and its worldwide follow up Mr. Driller: Drill Spirits.

Dig Dug: Digging Strike follows it up by having dinosaurs and other monsters being awoken from their underground slumber by The Republic of Horinesia’s drilling along a chain of tropical islands in the country. The protagonist of Dig Dug, Taizo Hori, is a divorced father jealous that his son Susumu is stealing the spotlight with his newfound fame from the events of Drill Sprints. He suddenly accepts the call from the republic’s president to deal with the attacking monsters based on his work on the “Dig Dug” incident. The tutorial has you playing through the events of [Dig Dug](https://retroachievements.org/game/12091) and [Dig Dug II](https://retroachievements.org/game/12092) before having you ship off to the island with Susumu tagging along to put down the raging beasts.

Gameplay is a mix between the island cutting gameplay of Dig Dug II and the traditional monster pumping and underground tunneling of the original. You have a boss monster you need to sink into the sea within each stage, and you do that by digging underground to plant massive spikes into the island to cut off pieces of the island from the center. All the while there’s treasures, artifacts, and power ups that can make you pump faster, stun enemies underground, or call in support of Susumu and his helicopter. He can change what direction the spikes will crack the island, bomb and stun the boss monster, or shoot down above ground enemies, [Xevious](https://retroachievements.org/hub/2768) style.

It's a pretty short game with only 12 stages, but the mix of the first two game’s mechanics and [Monster Hunter](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8392) style of taking down a huge monster within each stage makes for a unique experience of strategy, arcade chaos, and exploration. I definitely recommend trying it out for anyone who is itching for more Dig Dug action.

Cyber Troopers Virtual-On: Oratorio Tangram is an arena fighting game in which you pilot a mech to battle against other mechs in one-on-one battles. I have fond memories of playing Virtual-On at the arcade and getting absorbed into the combat, especially with the arcade's cockpit and joysticks that perfectly matched the game's unique control scheme. While the cockpit may not be included here, the [series](https://retroachievements.org/hub/23433) is still worth checking out, and this entry is no exception. The game features a varied cast of mechs suited to different playstyles, whether you prefer heavier hard hitting characters or those that can move quickly around the field. You're able to dash and hover across the arena, and each mech has several types of weapons in their arsenal for up-close and long distance combat. The controls may seem odd at first, but once you get a grasp on them, then movement and weapon usage will feel pretty natural. The set itself includes much of what is expected when it comes to fighting game sets. You have achievements for clearing the game with each character both on any difficulty and the hardest. There are also challenge achievements for each mech that showcase their special moves and modes, unlocking hidden characters, 1CC, survival mode, and more. If you're a fan of arena fighters and think that mechs are just plain awesome, then I'd recommend giving the game a try to experience the fast paced action for yourself. Whether you're looking for a fun fighting game to try or a set that'll give you a good challenge, this game will have you covered.
