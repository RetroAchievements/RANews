Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

We start this post with a drawing of a Scotting Terrier from Monopoly! This good boy is ready to steal your hotels and make you pay up.

Lokomelo reminisces about RetroAchievemas 2024, with the most memorable moment of Home Alone on the NES! It comes with the name "Le Cheese".

Assassin's Creed has seen games across a lot of time periods now, but one that is missing is 2186! Now visible as cover of the Gamer's Magazine, we'll go in-depth as to what crack Ubisoft is smoking this time.

Time for something different! If you are looking for games that have similar ideas to Pokémon but is not that, then maybe the Siralim series might be of interest. Mywifeleftm was a kickstarter backer for the third entry, and the reward was that he could draw a creature for the game! So here we have a fish that looks like a yellow rat named Piscacanth!

And here we have a selfie of one of the protagonist of Snow Bros., Nick! Look at this dandy goofball, getting ready to roll snow around in this arcade classic.

Aliens have descended to earth and are attempting to fit in with us humans. And what better way to do so than streaming Super Mario 64 on Twitch? After all, the Nintendo 64 controller looks like it's made for aliens so it's a perfect fit!
