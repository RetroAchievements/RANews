Get ready for a grind!

Setup:

1. Pick the 10 year game and select the sailing first mate.
*Alternatively, you could pick the woman on the box art - she claims to get you the "best deals" on goods, but I can't tell if this actually has an effect, while the sailor first mate visibly saves you travel time. This helps with a handful of things (loan repayment, catching the price of goods) and we are on a somewhat-strict time limit.
2. After naming your ship/captain, enter Hong Kong and go to the market.
3. Check the price of fine art:
  - If it's more than 400, either restart or sail to one of the closest cities and check the market again.
  - If it's under 400, buy as much as you can. Fill your ship's cargo and your
warehouse as much as possible and take out a max bank loan if you
still have cargo or warehouse space after you run out of money.
4. Sail to one of the closest cities (it should only take 1-2 days, depending on if you have the sailing first mate). Check the market and see if you can sell your fine art for a profit. If you can, do so, and try to find another cheap good to buy low and stock your ship. Stock your warehouse too if the city has one and you find a cheap good - remember warehouses are unique for each city, so you can't pull goods from a warehouse in City A if you're in City B.  
  - If you have spare cash, pay off your loan at the bank. If there's no bank or you don't have enough cash, don't worry about it.
5. Go back to Hong Kong and check the market. If fine art prices are up and you will make a profit, sell all of it in your warehouse.
6. If there's a type of good at a low price, you can buy/stock up on that, or you can continue to ping-pong between Hong Kong and other 1-2 day trip cities until fine arts are cheap and subsequently until they can be sold high again.
7. Repeat this until you have about 20 reputation. Once you do, go to a customs office and bribe them to buy illegal/exotic goods. These work the same as regular goods but will sell for a lot more.
8. Continue ping-ponging and buy/selling exotic goods. Use the huge cash flow to pay your bank loan, upgrade your cargo hold (to increase your profits per trip further), and then upgrade the rest of the ship.
9. Once your ship is maxed out, now we can start ship hunting. Switch to the sailor first mate if you don't have them already. Find a route between two cities. At least one (ideally both) should have shipyards to repair. You can either do a short route to minimize the time per trip or do a longer route, meaning your ship sails longer, which seems to trigger more encounters.
10.  Sail back and forth until you encounter a merchant or guard ship and attack them. The encounter rate is painfully low, and there's unfortunately nothing you can do but keep grinding.
11.  The most important thing: The game autosaves only, with no way to turn it off or do it manually, but you only autosave when you actually enter a city. Sail between two cities, and if you don't encounter any guards or merchants after a while, restart the game without visiting the city to save on time. If you do encounter and successfully defeat a merchant or guard ship, visit the city to save your progress. Depending on how quickly you get your ship maxed and ready for hunting, I would reset if you go more than 15-25 in-game days without encountering a merchant or guard.
