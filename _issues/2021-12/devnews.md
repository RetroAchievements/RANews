## Intro

What's happening with the developer side of the site.

## DevQuests

To stay up to date with all DevQuest information, [check out this forum thread](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=13060)!



### QUEST #006: The Unwanted **Addendum**

- **What:** Intellivision was removed from automatic re-spin eligibility.
- **Why:** Updates to the core resolved the issues that made it eligible before. 

- **What:** Developers can now re-spin ONCE if their claim expires or if they drop the set. However, if they drop the set, they will still need to wait until the claim would have expired. 
			For example: Claim is made on September 1st and then dropped on November 1st. The re-spin would still need to wait until December 1st. 
			Remember that this can only happen once so choose wisely
- **Why the penalty:** Because it keeps someone from doing re-spins until they get what they want, which is the exact opposite of what the DevQuest is about ??

### QUEST #011: Happy Birthday RA!

- **Goal:** Develop a set for the Mega Drive/Genesis to celebrate RA's first achievement!
- **Point of Contact:** {% rauserpic televandalist %} or really anyone on QA
- **Requirements:**
		1. All claims intended for this quest must follow normal procedure.
		2. Must be full sets.
		3. Sega CD and Sega 32X games are not eligible.
		4. No prototypes or hacks.
		5. Quest is available year round.
		6. If you already have one claimed you must be under 50% progress for it to count.
		7. Not stackable with other quests and not retroactive!
		
	**Addendum as of 11/26/2021**
- **What:** Major/Significant revisions will now be accepted for this DevQuest, Collabs are also accepted but do not stack with DevQuest #010
- **Why:** There are still a lot of Mega Drive/Genesis games that don't have sets, but considering it was the first supported console on RA, there are still tons of sets that are in dire need of repair and/or expansion.


## QA Weekly Wrap

Check out what the QA Team has been up to as of the last month.

- [QA Weekly Wrap: Oct 21st, 2021 - Nov 21st, 2021](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=14394)
- [QA Weekly Wrap: Nov 22nd, 2021 - Dec 4th, 2021](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=14466)


## Revision Changes

- **What:** 
		1. Changing the description to clarify or correct it to match the logic that is already present does **NOT** require a revision vote. 
		2. Altering the achievement's objective in any way **DOES** require a revision vote as always.

- **Why:** There's a bunch of achievements out there from back in the wild west days where developers would put "Collect a bunch of coins" or "Waste a bunch of time before fighting the boss". These give no indication of how much or how long someone has to spend doing it without looking at the code.

## Recycled Game Pages

- **Announcement:** Over the past few months there have been a few cases of game pages without sets having all their information wiped and the entries recycled. Unless it's a duplicate entry, please do not do this. If there is a legitimate reason for why you believe an entry should be trashed, please message the QATeam instead.
