## Saint Sword (Genesis/Mega Drive)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Console            | Genre  |

A fairly obscure action platformer for the Genesis. Each stage is free roaming with an arrow pointing to the exit and enemies you must overcome in the maze-like stage, but first you must locate the key. Collect it, get to the exit, fight a boss. Pretty typical. What is different is you can pick up powerups that let you temporarily change into different forms, like wings to help fly around the stage or a tail to help swim better. You can only hold limited amounts of each, so learning where best to use them is key. Add to it some pretty cool tracks and some nice graphics for the Genesis era, and this unknown game could be one that a player enjoys learning, as I did.

## Twin Cobra: Desert Attack Helicopter (Genesis/Mega Drive)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Console            | Genre                                                 |

[Toaplan](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8365) shooters are well known for three things: their challenge, their soundtracks, and their high replay value. The Genesis was the recipient of several: [Truxton](https://retroachievements.org/game/240), [Zero Wing](https://retroachievements.org/game/587), [Hellfire](https://retroachievements.org/game/113), [Fire Shark](https://retroachievements.org/game/2267), and Grind Stormer are all spoken of highly, but all owe their existence to the success of their predecessor: Twin Cobra.

Known as Kyuukyoku Tiger in Japan, Twin Cobra is the successor to [Tiger-Heli](https://retroachievements.org/game/1504), one of Toaplan's earliest offerings. Vertical shooters were arguably Toaplan's bread and butter, and while later offerings were more dazzling visually, the mechanics of Twin Cobra are quite sound, if challenging. And the soundtrack really slaps - Masahiro Yuge truly understood how to adapt his soundtracks to the Genesis, perhaps because the arcade versions utilized the same Motorola 68000 processor that powered the Genesis.

There are achievements already for the [PC Engine](https://retroachievements.org/game/18743) version, which itself is no slouch. There are also ports for the [NES](https://retroachievements.org/game/2048) (which I can't recommend on account of poor sound), as well as for the X68000 and FM Towns (JP computing platforms that aren't supported on RetroAchievements, at least for now). There's even a PS1 compilation that came out in Japan that is arcade perfect (and has an arranged soundtrack done by Masahiro Yuge himself that really elevates the experience), but to me, the Genesis version is the most accessible. Because of everything mentioned above, I see this as a prime candidate for a set.

## Tom Clancy's EndWar (PlayStation Portable)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Console              | Genre               |

This is a game I would love to see a set for. If you're a fan of turn-based strategy/war games, then this is a must play either way.

The creative director of this game was the co-founder of Blue Byte and the man who made Battle Isle, another great turn-based game for DOS. EndWar on the PSP/DS is a spiritual successor to that series; it uses the same hexagon grid, the same art style, etc. I really wish it got more love, though, because it's a fantastic game with a lot of depth. The sound design is stellar too.

The in-game explanation for the turn-based concept is that you're sending commands via satellite to the unit. This means that after your attack phase, the enemy's movement phase is executed. So you have to constantly try to move units in range of the enemy but also keep track of where they plan to go. If the enemy unit moves in range of yours, they will get an attack in before you can move your unit. It makes every level a fun puzzle when you're trying to earn the highest award. The DS version is technically easier in some ways because you get more information about the enemy's movement phase on the lower screen, but I prefer the PSP release because it looks and sounds much better. Besides, once you learn each map and the ideal way to beat it, there isn't a lot of variation to the enemy AI.

All that being said, it can be a really tough, unforgiving game at times. Sometimes bigger levels might take 2-3 hours just to medal, but when you do it's worth it. I never felt that the game was unfair though; if I failed a mission it was because I didn't read the objectives correctly, I misread the map, or I misused a unit somehow.

## X-COM: UFO Defense (PlayStation)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Console     | Genre                                                        |

Originally released in 1994 for DOS computers, X-COM: UFO Defense (to us in PAL regions better known as UFO: Enemy Unknown) is one of the most influential games in the turn-based strategy genre. Combining real-time global base building and army management with local tactical turn-based battles against an alien invasion, along with a well-crafted research system where you slowly discover, invent, and manufacture futuristic technologies based on the artifacts you recover from the alien skirmishes, you slowly turn the tide of the alien invasion throughout this game, until you're eventually able to take it back to the aliens' own doorstep and stop it (albeit not once and for all, as can be seen in the game's sequels).

As for RetroAchievements, there's plenty of space for both a basic set as well as a bonus one. For the basic set, there's specific research milestones and objectives that you have to hit to get to the game's ending (those could serve as the progression achievements), optional objectives that tend to be achieved by normal gameplay as well (researching the most advanced technologies in the various research trees, researching all the alien artifacts, alien autopsies, interrogations, etc.) as well as possible fun challenges, like completing a mission without any of your own soldiers ever shooting or leaving your aircraft, completing a mission only using grenades, completely destroying a Very Large UFO with your fighter aircraft, etc. I think anyone familiar with the game can easily see the possibilities there. For a bonus set, I think there could be some fun challenge runs, from the obvious ones like finishing the game on highest difficulty - a feat so coveted by the DOS version fans, where due to a bug, the difficulty didn't work properly - through completing the game without researching any advanced weapons, to feats like beating a non-damaged Very Large UFO mission with a single soldier.

On a more personal level, as you can probably gather from the previous paragraph, I'm a big fan of the game. I grew up with the DOS version of the game, as well as sometimes playing the PS1 version when I had access to the console, and it cemented my fondness for strategy games, as well as the tactical RPG genre, which then blossomed later during the PS1 era with titles like [Final Fantasy Tactics](https://retroachievements.org/game/11246), [Vandal Hearts](https://retroachievements.org/game/11333), [Tactics Ogre](https://retroachievements.org/hub/10856), or [Front Mission](https://retroachievements.org/hub/2795). But despite having access to all of these titles, I always returned to my first - UFO: Enemy Unknown.

All in all, I think this game could have a great set of achievements, and with its complexity and varied systems, there's plenty of design space for really interesting cheevos. Perhaps it could also lead to people who are maybe only familiar with the new XCOM titles (which are fantastic as well), or even unfamiliar with the series at all, to discover this gem, and experience the joy of your soldiers not being able to hit a huge alien point-blank with a laser rifle.

## Etrian Odyssey III: The Drowned City (Nintendo DS)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Console     | Genre                                                                                                             |

If you've ever wanted to feel like a true explorer, Etrian Odyssey III: The Drowned City is the perfect game for you. There are no predefined maps or marked routes here - every step you take in the mysterious Yggdrasil labyrinth is a new opportunity to discover hidden passages, face unknown dangers, and carve your own path in a world where exploration is key. From the very first moment, you'll find yourself immersed in the task of mapping the terrain, noting points of interest, traps, and treasures - just like an adventurer of old, with nothing but your wits as a guide.

But exploration isn't the only thing that makes this RPG special. Combat is another of its fundamental pillars, challenging players to think strategically in every encounter. With a turn-based system that rewards planning and synergy between classes, each battle is a test of intelligence and adaptability. The options for assembling your team are varied and allow for immense customization. There are no pre-made heroes or mandatory paths here - you decide how to approach the adventure, creating a party with complementary skills that suit your playstyle.

The story is another crucial piece that makes this game incredible. As you venture into the submerged city, you begin to uncover secrets of a lost civilization and mysteries that push you to keep exploring. Why does the ocean hide ancient ruins? What unknown forces have shaped this world? Every piece of information you find adds another layer of depth to the journey, making exploration feel purposeful beyond mere survival.

If you're into aerial combat games and havenâ€™t played Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War yet, you're missing out. When I first played it many years ago, I expected just another arcade flight sim, but was surprised by how deep and engaging the story was. What I thought would be a simple flying game turned into a much more captivating and impactful journey. When I played it again a while ago, I was happy to find that it still holds up and feels as fresh as I remembered. The controls are easy to pick up, but the game is still challenging, and the aerial battles are immersive, making you feel like you're really flying a fighter jet.

The plot is where Ace Combat 5 shines. What begins as a straightforward war story quickly evolves into something more complex and unpredictable. The twists keep you hooked, and the characters, each with their own backstories and motivations, really pull you in. The soundtrack is perfect for setting the mood, heightening the tension during the most intense moments, and making the story feel even more dramatic.

Ace Combat 5 combines exciting aerial combat with a surprisingly solid story. Whether you're into flight sims or just looking for a game with more depth, itâ€™s definitely worth playing. The action and plot twists keep things fresh, making it a game youâ€™ll remember long after youâ€™ve finished.

Do you like racing games? Do you want to play a simcade racing game that features a story mode with female drivers as the main characters? R: Racing Evolution is the game for you.

Made by the same team that bought you the [Ridge Racer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7871) series, R: Racing Evolution features real life cars racing in real life locations, such as: De Tomaso Pantera's aT Twin Ring Motegi, Toyota VM180's at Suzuka, and GT class cars at Phillips Island. The game also features a story mode where you take ambulance driver "Rena Hayami" through her new venture of a racing career, through all the twists and turns that come with it.

There is also the Event Challenge part of the game: this features 166 challenges across multiple scenarios that include Tournaments, Championships (known as Tour Races), Time Trials, and more. Cars unlocked through the story mode can be used here, but cars can also be purchased and upgraded in this section, allowing for challenges to become easier (or harder) depending on preference/skill level.

And whilst the NTSC-U version is listed down for the "Supported Game Files", those who have played this game prefer the PAL (European) version for its region exclusive cars that were added on to the existing car list. These cars included the Ford Puma and Fiat Punto Kit Cars, RUF RGT and the TVR Cerbera Speed Twelve. If you think you have what it takes to do this game justice, please create a set for this awesome racing game.

Suzuki Bakuhatsu is one of the hidden gems of the PS1. It never left Japan, and was released pretty late in the lifespan of the console (July 2000). Being developed by a company called "Sol", which worked on various [Flintstones](https://retroachievements.org/hub/3219) games on the SNES before, it was really different from what they used to do. In this game, you play as Suzuki, a girl who can see bombs pretty much everywhere (the first one is a literal orange); fortunately, she's also an expert in defusing bombs!

It's a puzzle game where your task is to defuse the bomb in front of you. To do that, you'll first have to find the bomb in the item that is presented to you (for example, in the tutorial you have to peel the orange first, since the bomb is inside of it). The entire game is in 3D, but you don't have a free cam; instead, you can rotate the item or zoom in, fixed by the game (you have arrows that indicate if you can "move" in a certain way). Depending on the bomb you'll have various tools to help you, the most important one being the screwdriver! Suzuki can also analyze every interactable element in the current plane you are in, giving you advice, reading the message stick on the bomb, or giving you random trivia.

The big downside of the game is that it's in Japanese only. And while the first puzzles are straightforward once you figure out the controls, the more you advance in the game, the more complex it becomes (some puzzles require you to send the electrical current in the right direction or else the bomb immediately explodes, and one is literally a riddle), and not being able to read the clues written on the bomb can handicap you a LOT if you want to perfect all the defusing, because you have a time limit (depending of the complexity of the bomb) and a scoring system: the faster and with the lesser movement you defuse a bomb, the better your ranking.

I think RA would benefit to give some light to this gem. It has a huge vibe of the end of the 90â€™s, it features absurd humor dear to Japan (the expressions of Suzuki, the SFX, the music, even the cutscenes, which are literal slideshows with no dialogue), the music is full of bangers, the game isn't too long to beat and has some re-playability (the scoring system, and also between stages you can choose the next hour of the day, meaning you won't see all the puzzles in one play-through). I really like this game and I would LOVE to see a set for it. Thanks for reading!

Monster Racers is one of those hidden gems of the DS era. It features fun mechanics like raising tons of different monsters to do a side scrolling race against NPCs, with some great music to go with it, and even a fun chance to get "rare" variants of monsters. Even if you don't end up getting these rare types, there are fun customization options, like changing your monster's color. I'm really surprised not more people have even heard of the game.

Please give this anime styled sprite game with charming characters and a fun story to go with it a chance. I've spent plenty of hours in this game as a kid and I'd love for more people to experience it with achievements!

This was a game I used to play a lot on my PC when I was a child. For most Commandos fans, it is the worst game in the saga, but I love it with all my heart. It's a pretty fun WW2 FPS with a gameplay that is quite similar to the first [Call Of Duty](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7068) games. My favorite missions were the ones where you controlled the spy, as you had to play stealthily so that you wouldn't be detected. I would love to play it again, but this time with achievements. If possible, I would ask that the achievements be compatible with a hash in Spanish so I can enjoy it again like I did when I was young. I think interesting challenges could be made with this game.
