## \~Hack~ Mario's Point and Click 64 (Nintendo 64)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Console     | Genre                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I like playing [Super Mario 64](https://retroachievements.org/game/10003) from time to time, and I love playing the creative rom hacks people have created over the years. This one is by far one of the most innovative takes on the vanilla game that I have played.

If you didn't know, the N64DD had an official mouse that came bundled with "Mario Artist: Paint Studio" released in Japan. I assume that was the inspiration behind this hack, as you control the entire game with just your mouse! Every move Mario makes comes from just the mouse. Left clicking drops a pointer wherever you clicked and Mario then moves to that position. You can add some spice to this action by right clicking, which pauses the game and brings up an interaction menu. You get the option to do advanced techniques like jump, long jump, wall jump, crouch, and even toggle if Mario walks or runs. There are also new UI elements for controlling the camera, no C-Buttons here! If you are having troubles getting the hang of the controls there's a great tutorial that you can play that covers just about all the actions you can pull off.

It becomes more of a logical game than a platforming collect-a-thon, making sure you think about every single action you make instead of relying on impulse. Simple stars become quite challenging without direct control over Mario! I can't recommend this enough if you want to replay Super Mario 64 with a new twist!

## Driver: You Are The Wheelman (Game Boy Color)

No one cares about [GTA](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8759). [Driver](https://retroachievements.org/game/11391) is the shit.

Ok this is nostalgia talking, GTA is definitely better, but Driver always felt like the start of the idea behind this game to me. Driving in the streets with police cars chasing you always brings badass gameplay, and that game did deliver in the end of the 90's. Well, that was on the PlayStation, but now we do Game Boy Color! It is always nice to see how video game developers turn a big 3D game into a 2D portable console one. The result definitely was not on the same rank as its home console counterpart.

The game uses the top down view like the early GTA games, and missions aren't much more than drive from A to B. It could be under a timer, without destroying your car while avoiding the police, or while chasing a bad guy. There are a few extra modes like checkpoint races, pursuits, survivals, and free roaming in the few city maps the game offers.

A friend lent me the game when I was a kid, and it definitely felt like a more boring version of Driver. Replaying it today with the achievements set by our fellow recently graduated dev {% rauserpic Raeyene %} turned the game into more of what I call a good time. The missions aren't that hard, except for a few random ones, since the difficulty curve is a bit unbalanced. It either gets easier at some point (or maybe I just got better at the game), but I do remember clearing the last few missions pretty quickly.

This is a good chill GBC set, and I believe we should support our new developers so they can continue making awesome sets for this awesome community.

## Grand Theft Auto III (PlayStation 2)

Every console generation starts off the same way: this is more of the same, this is a slightly upgraded graphical fidelity. It can sometimes take several years before you start to get to the true reasons to own a brand new console. There's always one game that seems to not only put cracks in the dam of creativity, but shatters the dam to change the industry.

3D Worlds were always segmented. [Mario 64](https://retroachievements.org/game/10003) had individual levels. [Crash Bandicoot](https://retroachievements.org/game/10434) was basically a 2D platformer where you run north instead of east (and sometimes towards the screen itself when a boulder wants to crush you, or a polar bear is feeling hungry). There were no games that truly felt alive. GTA 3's three islands all felt alive. Even before you start following the Capital Letters on your mini-map, you can start exploring the map, finding hidden packages or doing the taxi and vigilante side missions.

Being the first of three (well, five if you count the ports of the PSP GTA games) games that defined both a console generation AND the genre as a whole (everything wanted to be GTA, which is why you got both [Scarface](https://retroachievements.org/game/20684) AND [The Godfather](https://retroachievements.org/game/20764) emulating the mission structure and city portions, you get [Mercenaries](https://retroachievements.org/game/3320) doing GTA but it's war, even [Spider-Man](https://retroachievements.org/game/5677) shifted to this format), you can imagine that the game itself may feel a bit barebones, especially when you consider the absolute glut of side missions and non-story "stuff" from something like [San Andreas](https://retroachievements.org/game/2772). That being said, I find the achievement set for GTA III to be the most interesting of the original trilogy. For the other two, well made as they are, the set is more a checklist to getting 100%. Maybe because this game is older, and thus the designer had more time logged in their total gaming history to pull experience from, this set gets clever. You get your standard "collect all the hidden packages, do all the story missions" that you would expect for progress, but nearly every single story mission has its own missable "do this mission under these constraints" achievement to collect.

Look, I get having a fear of missing out on something just because the set expects you to play a game in a way you wouldn't necessarily do on your own, and I would never want to belittle or put down anyone's chosen way to play. For me personally, one of the many joys of RA is taking a game that I have played more times than I can count and finding things that I never found on my own. A lot of these missable sub-quest type achievements showcase a different way to complete a story mission than just the obvious ways. If nothing else, it helps the player think outside the box, which in a sandbox kind of game, isn't that sort of the point? Don't let the missable count deter you: this is absolutely worth checking out.

## Radiant Historia (Nintendo DS)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Console     | Genre                                                    |

Radiant Historia is possibly my favorite RPG ever. I've completed it four or five times now, and I love it even more each time I play. Its main mechanic, branching time travel, is definitely the highlight of the game. As you play, you'll find yourself jumping between two main timelines in a desperate bid to save the world. The story of the game is also very good; despite a few unexplained plot twists, each timeline's story is very well executed overall. And each time I play, I am caught off guard by the ending, despite having seen it many times before.

From a gameplay perspective, Radiant Historia requires minimal level grinding, and no money grinding. Once you get a hang of the battle grid (which is also really cool by the way), you won't have any trouble dispatching anything you encounter.

The music of the game is also beautiful. I can't list it as the best part because the game itself is so good, but the music is amazing. I highly suggest playing with sound on.

Lastly, but certainly not least, the achievement set by {% rauserpic MGNS8M %} is also very good. There is an achievement for each quest, and for each bad ending, too! Another great thing about it: due to the game's time travel mechanics, nothing is missable. You can always go back to get something you didn't catch the first time through.

In essence: play this set. Also, that badge would look awesome on your wall, wouldn't it? Why not master? You won't regret it.

## Legend of Mana (PlayStation)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Console     | Genre                                                |

Over the years I have seen several online polls asking players to rank the [Mana](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7362) series games, and I am consistently surprised when Legend of Mana comes in ranked below [Secret of Mana](https://retroachievements.org/game/400) and [Trials of Mana](https://retroachievements.org/game/1391), both for the SNES. Not only do I enjoy Legend's aesthetic and story more, but every system in Legend is objectively deeper than its counterparts in the SNES games. When I first encountered this game in the summer of 1999, I was an awestruck 10 year old gaming noob, and a deep understanding of the mechanics in the game was something that exceeded my grasp at the time. Despite this, I still enjoyed the game for its fun combat, engaging world & story, and the sense of accomplishment I got for having completed a "big kid" game, despite having discovered only a fraction of what it had to offer. Over the years I would revisit the game several times, each time diving deeper into the mechanics and story, reading literal volumes of guides and FAQs about the game until I had mastered all of its systems, from weapon crafting and farming to golem creation and monster raising.

So, why should you play this set? Why not read a book, or slam another [Kaizo Mario](https://retroachievements.org/hub/5863) hack, or catch up on "The Last of Us"? (No Spoilers!) Well, for starters because it's a really great game even without achievements. I played it to 100% completion 6 times in my life before I even discovered RA and was amazed and impressed with the game every time. This set allowed me to enjoy it all over again from a new angle, and I even learned a new secret or two! New players will appreciate the action RPG combat that is easy to understand but difficult to master, the truly breathtaking and unique style of art, the enchanting OST, and the engaging world full of secrets to discover. Veteran players will find an achievement set that so completely covers what the game has to offer for content they may discover something completely new, as well as challenging combat achievements that will test their skills, as they cannot be cheesed by completing them on new game+ with busted end game weapons. {% rauserpic Alena %} deserves many congratulations for creating such a thorough set for this hidden gem of a game.

I'd like to close this article by sending out an invitation to anyone who played this game in their youth, but unlike me became daunted by its depth and complexity and never returned. Come back to Fa'Diel. An amazing adventure awaits you. If you need a lifeline, there is now a wealth of resources about this game online that simply did not exist in 1999. The world slumbers yet and awaits your return to awaken it, and shape the future as you see fit, brave Hero of Mana.

## Yume Penguin Monogatari (NES/Famicom)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Console     | Genre                                                    |

Yume Penguin Monogatari is a cute Japanese platformer for the Famicom. The main character is a blue penguin named Penta, who is on his way to find his pink "dream penguin" Penko through 6 levels. Some of them are just platforming levels, and some of them are simple shoot 'em up stages. At the end of each level, a boss needs to be defeated.The game itself is quite easy, but is rich in variety, while the set includes some fair challenges. A mastery is doable in a decent amount of time. The whole thing looks like a lot of fun to play...

But the game is special. Under this cute surface lies a dark background. The pink dream penguin is a really bad girl. She urges the main character to lose weight and become slim almost the whole time, while her secret lover is already in the background. This guy controls the enemies in the game, who try to feed Penta rice balls and fruits. If he eats too much, he will become too fat and loses at the end of the stage because his girlfriend doesn't want him anymore. She even asks him to do exercises in the desert. Does she want to see him dead?
He always follows her orders and jumps and flies through dangerous environments, just to be called fat on the phone. You can even lose the game after defeating the final boss while not in shape.

The whole game is not about cute penguins, it's about a toxic relationship and someone who can't escape, while the other partner just tries to play with him. Don't judge a book by the cover. Play it, to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

## Contra (NES/Famicom)

Contra is an all-time classic game from the NES era, created by [Konami](https://retroachievements.org/hub/3949) within the first decade of their foray into making video games. It originally started as an arcade game, but as many popular arcade games did, it quickly found its way onto home consoles, and suffice to say that for the NES, Contra turned out being a highly addictive and thrilling experience with its classic 2D run & gun gameplay, along with some pseudo 3D sections, which were quite uncommon for the system. You control Bill Rizer, one of two marines fighting in a war against the aliens, and must go through seven action-packed stages to reach the aliens’ lair and destroy the Alien Heart at the end of the eighth and final stage of the game. You’ve got many tools at your disposal, including weapon power-ups such as the flamethrower and rapid-fire shots, the ability to crouch and drop through semi-solid platforms, and the freedom of being able to shoot in all eight cardinal directions.

The game features one of, if not the most, classic video game codes of all time, aptly named the Konami code, where in this game it allows the player to start with 30 lives, making this tough-as-nails game a little easier and more forgiving for less experienced players. You’re definitely going to want to use it for a first time playthrough, and for Contra’s set on the site, it’s not only needed for the mastery badge, but it’s also an extremely useful tool for getting some of the many challenge achievements found in the set. There’s an added bonus in the sense that you’ll have plenty of lives to help navigate through the trickiest sections of the game, getting the practice needed for many of the achievements that prohibit the usage of the Konami code. Even without it, Contra’s set provides a unique, challenging experience for a game hailed as one of the NES’ best!

I've unfortunately not been an RA member long enough to really be a good judge of quality for sets. Still, there is one set that I want to aim for later on that I feel has a really good balance of easier and harder challenges as well as good gimmick fights throughout, and that is The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
 
It's a really good set that has achievements for all collectables and main known secrets (plus the Chris Houlian room system). It has one special gimmick for every boss fight, as well as a separate damageless achievement that could easily be done on different occasions, but you could take it up a notch and go for both of them simultaneously for style points! It also is technically doable in one playthrough (minus one? achievement that requires a bottle), but the game is short enough that doing multiple playthroughs is not that much of a pain.
 
I feel this is kind of a gold standard for what sets should aim for: nothing is insanely difficult to obtain. Some things will be harder, but nothing feels unfair. More sets should aim for this.

Ever wonder what [Mario Party](https://retroachievements.org/hub/13353) would be like if Sonic took a swing at it? Or maybe you'd just rather it have a bit more strategy than luck? Either way, Sonic Shuffle is the answer! Heck, it's even made by [Hudson Soft](https://retroachievements.org/hub/6879), the guys behind the OG Mario Parties!

Your goal is to acquire as many of the Precioustones (7 at most) on a stage as possible, each earning an Emblem (think Power Stars). There's also Bonus Emblems you can get, such as ending with the most Rings, completing the board-specific quest, and winning the end of board Bonus Minigame. However, this is no clone! The game doesn't end until the last Precioustone is obtained, different characters have different special abilities, and most notably of all? You move by choosing cards, NOT randomly rolling a die!

But be warned: other players can (and will) choose your cards to play as their own! Will you save your big movers and risk an upset? Use your big cards and risk not having enough firepower for fighting enemies (such as those guarding the Precioustones)? Or will you take the same risk the CPUs are, and try to steal their cards? Just don't grab an Eggman, or you'll face the wrath of one of his eeevil inventions!

Civ Rev delivers the same great [Sid Meier's](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7334) experience, just condensed and optimized for quick-fire, stop-start fun; it’s perfect for handheld play on the go, and a great starting point for any novice of the series.

Beating the game is simple enough and victory can be earned through one of four ways: Domination, Cultural, Science, and Economic. Whether you force your opponents into submission through the might of your army or win the space race, that is purely up to you, and can be persuaded depending on which world leader you choose, all with their own unique perks.

Mastering the set? Well, that won't be so easy, nor quick, but it will certainly be fun and a solid challenge. The set ensures you truly become a master of the game, throwing in a lot of clever and humorous challenges (both in-game, and arbitrary), with my personal favorite being [Awakening the Beast [Apocalypse!]](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/251370), which forces the player to nuke another civilization with Gandhi... talk about irony.

If you’re looking for a strategy set that rewards creativity and experimentation; Civ Rev on DS is a fantastic pick. It’s approachable for newcomers, satisfying for veterans, and packed with enough variety to keep every run feeling fresh.
