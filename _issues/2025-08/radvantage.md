# SETTING YOUR CONTROLS

For this specific song, I've needed to setup three different WASD's to help me to get through some sessions, which I'll show now on the pic below:

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8y65I1c.png" /></p>

The Layout 1 is for the directional buttons (Up, Down, Left and Right) + normal buttons (Triangle, Square, Circle and X). Since PD2 have, unlike PD1, these buttons (Image below), which works when you press the current direction + the normal button corresponding to the direction (e.g.: Right + Circle, Up + Triangle, Left + Square and Down + X).

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wYU0Aeo.png" /></p>

The Layout 2 is for the normal buttons too, but with a twist: they're settled to work on Rapid Fire mode, which is available on the "Control Mapping" menu on PPSSPP. You'll go all the way down until you see the "Rapid Fire" option and bind the keys you want for it. In my case, I've binded the keys T, F, G and H (image bellow) 'cause is very near to WASD, so if I need to switch quickly between inputs with or without Rapid Fire, they're very near each other, which is gonna be very important during "The Intense Voice of Hatsune Miku".

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mx54DNJ.png" /></p>

At last, the Layout 3 is for the normal buttons without any special config, just they for themselves. And, just to make clear, you don't need to copy EXACTLY that config, specially if you already have a nice input config that is better for you. I'm just showing the config that worked better for me during my playthrough.

# THE NICE AND EASY START (00:00-01:27)

Don't be scared of the music ~~until the mashing sessions, of course.~~  

The beginning of it is pretty chill, only some small sessions of mashing 3 or 4 buttons, so you can do it without the turbo.

The music goes on until a session which starts to slow down, the calm before the storm (or the first mashing session).
On this one, after you go through the last hit of the combined input (direction button + normal button), you'll pause the game and go to the "Controls" settings on the PPSSPP menu, go all the way down until you see the "Rapid Fire Interval".

> P.S.: It's possible to do this setting before you start the song, of course. But, during your retries, there's the chance that you just forget to set this config before starting again, so try keep that in mind.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tUqWd9e.png" /></p>

Set it on "3" and just press your respective turbo button for Circle. On this part, it's important to get "Cool" grade on the most notes you can get, but if you time it right it's very possible to get "Cool" on all of it.

# THE INTENSE PAIN OF HITTING SAD OR WORSE (01:53-02:21)

Now we're getting to the tricky part: the second mashing session.

This one starts like the first one: after you hit the last combined input, you'll pause the game and go again on the "Controls" settings, but now you'll change the "Rapid Fire Interval" to "2" instead of "3". Unlike the last session, this one you can't just hold the button until the end, since the timing of the notes doesn't fit exactly the Rapid Fire Interval of your input (I've tested with the interval on 2 and 3, both don't work with the "just hold the button" strategy).

So... what you can do? You can hold and release the button in short intervals.

In that way, you can get a lot of "Fine" and even some "Cool" grades without hurting your fingers. But, since isn't free like that, you'll still have to train a little to get the hang of the timings, specially 'cause this session contains all the normal buttons, specifically two entire rows of each one, from the bottom to the top of the screen, which got me confused on the start.

# TURBOSN'T (02:30-02:38)

On this part, I prefer to hit the notes individually without the turbo for the safety that I'll get more points for it ("Cool" or "Fine" grade). This session goes until the final Circle button (yellow arrow) of the big circle stairs that goes to the left bottom corner of the screen (following the red arrow). After this circle, we start the final session of the song.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/n5hmSbg.png" /></p>

> P.S.: on the circle stair I prefer to not use the Rapid Fire, but you can try if you want, I can see this working, I just don't like using it on this session specifically.

# SAD OR WORSE: PART 2 (02:38-The End)

So, on this part you gotta be quick to swap between your normal button to your Rapid Fire button since you're in the middle of the mashing session.

Right after you press the final circle on the left bottom corner of the screen, you'll do the same thing you did on the part 3: hold and release the button. This session is more important 'cause the "Chance Time" starts right there, and you can get more points if you hit more notes right. So, make sure you can do it consistently and with as few "Sad" or "Worse" as possible. Of course this is hard as hell, even with the Rapid Fire inputs, but is more healthy for your hands and fingers, for sure.

The timestamps on the title of each session is for the video I've made just for this guide to demonstrate, in a better way, the instructions I've wrote for you. Funny that I've got an Excellent grade on this video, which was my first ever on this song. The video itself is linked bellow:

I hope this little guide can help someone to get pass this thing 'cause it was very difficult for me on the first attempts before I've tried to use these cute strategies which helped me a lot and saved my hands.

Best of luck to all of you and keep having fun. âœ¨
