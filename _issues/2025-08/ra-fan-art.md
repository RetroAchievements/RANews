Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

We all have those days where we just want to lay down, look at the clouds and contemplate life. Pac-man has it today, where he looks at the clouds and is reminded of his old days where he was just a pizza slice. I miss you too pizza slice...

Speaking of reminiscing, here was have a blast to the past with 8-bit Donkey Kong and Pauline standing on top of a real building! What a cool way to throw our favourite ape into a real picture. Now if only he wouldn't throw barrels down...

The South Park cast is playing dress-up, and today's theme is Dragon Ball Z! Goku Cartman is ready to use his fart kamehameha's, and Vegeta Butters will oppose him by just... standing there. Menacingly.

And in today's edition of "Pictures you probably did not want to see", we have Ryu dressing up as Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider series! Well at least it... looks fitting? Anyway, please pass me the bleach (good job though Hotscrock!)

"Grunt, Jump, then Belly Bump" is the assignment VintageNomad got, and who better to do so that our favourite round-shaped characters from Nintendo, Snorlax and Wario? With their fat demonstrated over the years, they won't even feel it!

Chris Redfield is faced with his worst enemy... a boulder! But he decided to no longer abide by quick-time event laws. Why slowly punch a rock if you can just JoJo it? ORAORAORA!

The bus stop got some odd characters in line today! Kenny has decided to throw away his DBZ costume, and is last in line after mister monopoly himself, James Pond, and the ice man!

Samus has been fighting aliens for years, but even she was not prepared for a threat unlike any other: skeletons! And indeed, he managed to lay a decisive blow on here! The galaxy is no longer at peace...
