This achievement may seem difficult but with my guidance you should have no problem badging the set and getting on my special list of very cool people.

This playthrough of the game mostly focuses on speed, losing lives due to deaths shouldn't be too much of a problem since many lives can be earned during the run. One thing you should know is that running out of time does NOT use a continue, it only uses up a life.

The strategy for most of the stages is pretty simple: beat the stage as fast as you can while earning any extra lives you see. The only part you want to look out for is the stage 4 wizard boss. It can be easy to lose a ball in the small gap at the bottom right corner of the screen.

The main struggles come in the final stage. Try to take the left tunnel, it is by far the fastest. Unfortunately, the final boss does not have any easy trick to it. The best strategy is to get the ball bouncing between the boss and the back wall. If you are lucky, the boss will move towards the wall and quickly rack up tons of damage. Once the boss is defeated there is still a small hallway to get through, move fast as you may only have seconds to spare! If you do run out of time, you will be sent back to the start of the stage.
