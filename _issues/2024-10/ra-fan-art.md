Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

Link just can't ever catch a break can he... Once he finally decided to sleep, he's being stalked by a treasure chest--but not just any treasure chest, a giant enemy crab treasure chest! I don't think this is the treasure he's looking for though.

Party at the beach! Crrool and their Rack It Up friends are enjoying the food they made during the Harvest Festival, and are getting ready to cook it in a big pot for everyone to enjoy.

Sioneus provides us with a picture of good ol' Chunky Kong, posing for the camera in the best way he possibly could: with a big grin on his face!

Lara Croft is doing her favourite activity of the week, tomb raiding! She was told about a particular tomb called the Dark Cave... and when inside she got attacked by hordes of Zubat! Oh, and Lycanroc was there too to say hi. Please don't kill the good dog!

After the seven chosen gamers played a game of a super hero each, it was time for them to meet up for their new group: the Amiga League! Featuring heroes like Thor, Spiderman, Viewtiful Joe... Ultraman? Must give them credit, it sure is a diverse group!

Rixor14 was given the objective to draw a cursed cover of Manci Games with extremely butchered and off-brand characters... and I think we can they succeeded! Featuring a very unsettling Cloud, a deformed Inkling, and Ristar with an interesting face, this will be the magazine to check out for people looking for something different!

Chun-li may be powerful, but it can never hurt to add some additional techniques to the arsenal. Therefore, Ryu is helping her out by learning her their trademark technique: the Shoryuken! But will she be able to pull it off?

R0ach3d wasn't the only one hanging out with friends, as we also got mywifeleftm hanging out with their friends in a drawing that looks like it was made by a 5-year old! My inner 5-year old can relate to this image very badly...
