X-Zone was featured this last year during the Achievement of the Week event and immediately earned the ire of many due to being perceived as immensely difficult. This whopping 50 point achievement (as well as another 50 point achievement 1,000,000 Points (50) 1,000,000 Points (50)) both can be yours with minimal frustration with some background information about the how this niche title actually plays. I shared this information in the AotW thread at the time, but these points can now be yours too if you weren't following along at the time.

This light gun game at first appears to do what many of their ilk do: Ask you to turn on the SNES Super Scope turbo button and then hammer away with that machine gun to blow everything to smithereens. However, you might find as you get past level 1 things start to seem abnormally difficult with using just this machine gun to take out the multitudes of enemies on screen. That is because the game has another weapon that's not immediately apparent: Homing Missiles.

In your main Retroarch Controls input page, go to Port 2, scroll down to the gun controls section and then map "Gun Trigger" as Mouse 1 and "Gun Aux A" as Mouse 2. From there you should be able to play the game by holding right click to bring up an aiming reticle and sweeping over the enemies to lock on. You can then fire your missiles by letting go of your machine gun fire you are using with left click. By developing a pattern of using this "right-click reticle" at all times and occasionally turning off your machine gun to fire your missiles, you'll find that the game suddenly becomes a cakewalk. Even the majority of the previously impossible "Hard difficulty" achievements will now be in your grasp.
