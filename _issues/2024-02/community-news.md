## Standalone Support

<p align="center">

</p>

As many of you may have already heard, we've been working with the HorizonXI team to bring RetroAchievements support to their Final Fantasy XI private server. Their ideology of maintaining that classic feel of the older FFXI era with some new experiences aligns well with the RA goal of bringing achievements to classic gaming experiences. FFXI holds a significant place in gaming history, especially as a landmark title for the PS2, and we're hoping to introduce even more players to it with this partnership!

Three sets are currently available to play:

|                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {% ragamepic 28275, 088542, Final Fantasy XI %}                            |
| {% ragamepic 28317, 089081, Final Fantasy XI: Rise of the Zilart %}        |
| {% ragamepic 28303, 088543, Final Fantasy XI [Subset - Hero of Nations] %} |
