Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up and Challenge League Top 100 events.

**If you have made fan art for Bendyhuman's Challenge League Top 100 task and you want us to showcase your art, please send them to our inbox or let any of our members know, thank you! Any other fan art is also welcome!**

Ever wanted to let other people know that you want some pizza? You're in luck! With this cap of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles made by Pudpod, you too can now let people know that it's PIZZA TIME BABY!

Now on the other hand, we have the people who really don't like pizza time--or rather, the turtles who really love pizzas. Good thing that Vlt0 has you covered with this shirt of The Shredder, who really needs a hug. Poor Shredder.

Bendy is playing Monopoly with his strongest opponent yet: a pink puff ball named Kirby! This adversary perfectly understands the rules of the game; after all, if you don't lose, that means you win right?
