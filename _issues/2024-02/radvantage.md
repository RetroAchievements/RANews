Earning the highest score achievement in Canabalt requires surviving for an awfully long time, but it isn’t nearly as challenging as it may seem initially once you know the strategy. Unlike pretty much every other endless runner I’ve played, your run doesn’t immediately end any time you hit something; small objects such as crates merely cause your character to slow down slightly. While this may seem undesirable at first, the game becomes far more manageable once you realize that you don’t need that much speed to make the widest jumps it throws at you. Deliberately lowering your speed gives you far more time to react and avoids the need for short hops, and while it will greatly extend the duration of your run, I found that it made survival far, far easier. There’s a balancing act in finding the ideal speed that isn’t too high or too low, but once you get a feel for it, there’s very little that can stop you. Just be careful of low windows, as at low speeds these are the only obstacles that still require a light tap of the jump button.
