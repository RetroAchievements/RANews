# Episode 18 - Tropical Fruits of MelonDS

On our first episode one of our guests was the progenitor of our whole community, Scott - where we were able to get some introspection on how and why the website came to be, and what those first steps looked like. From there we've visited Events, the Junior Program, the highest ranking member on the site; and plenty more - Most recently though, we sat down with Wes and got an idea of what development behind the scenes passed, present, and future looks like. 

We still have deeper to dig however, and in an effort to learn more about what makes this whole machine function I was able to secure our guest here today, JesseTG, who has been diligently coding away on an enhanced remake of the melonDS core for libretro that prioritizes which aims to provide standalone parity, reliability, and usability. With such an undertaking and font of knowledge, this is sure to be an episode worth diving in on.
