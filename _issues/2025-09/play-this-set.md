## Game & Watch: Donkey Kong Jr. & Chef (Nintendo DSi)

The final part of the DSi [Game & Watch](https://retroachievements.org/hub/10685?sort=-playersTotal&filter[subsets]=only-games) reviews, this time covering the Wide Screen series and the New Wide Screen series with Chef and Donkey Kong Jr. Like their name suggests, they were in wide screen, plus the New Wide Screen series had enhancements that were added in the Multi Screen series of Game & Watches.

First off, Chef. In this game, you must juggle 3 foods in the air, avoiding dropping them on the floor. In Game B, a fourth food is added to the mix, making it more challenging. This game reminds me of [Ball](https://retroachievements.org/game/22397) and [Vermin](https://retroachievements.org/game/22437) in a way.

Next, Donkey Kong Jr. In this game, you must save DK from the cage as you avoid Snapjaws. The way to free DK is by hitting left and up on the D-pad (which is a bit clunky control-wise) when the key is near DK Jr. You have to do this 4 times to free DK. This is probably the most complex Game & Watch game of the DSi rereleases.

In terms of achievements, Chef only has high score achievements; however, due to how challenging Game B is compared to Game A, the hardest achievement is [World's Greatest Chef](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/284496), while for Donkey Kong Jr. it’s [Just Like Billy Mitchell](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/361686).

This is a very underrated game, and this is why you should play it: the game inserts your character into the world of the Barnyard movie, filled with minigames and scenes from the movie. I suggest this version instead of [PS2](https://retroachievements.org/game/20694) because the GameCube set has more challenges for each minigame, along with extra content. I love the idea of having my own character make changes in the world. It has a nice chill feel to it, even if you only want to play it without intentions of mastering it. And if you are an event player like me, this one has a lot of options to fulfill various event challenges, so hop in!

I found all of the games in this trilogy to be incredibly cathartic experiences despite my limited knowledge of Japanese. While this game requires the player to be able to recognize hiragana and katakana to progress optimally, both {% rauserpic Skiichi %}’s excellent guides along with the game's eagerness to gently guide players away from reaching a bad ending short of bombing every date they go on allows AKB1/48: Idol to Koishitara to be a game I would gladly recommend to anyone on RA who has an interest in playing a game outside of their native language. I think this game is very accessible even to players who are just beginning to learn Japanese.

The core gameplay loop is very simple. On day 1 the player will have the option to ask any of the 48 idols out on a date. On every subsequent day a random assortment of idols will be available to ask out instead of the entire cast, but any idol you've previously gone on a successful date with will be guaranteed to show up again later in the run. Every few days the player is presented with a chart of the hearts they've broken (comprised of idols they didn't ask out or gave bad date answers to) until eventually the cast will be whittled down to the small group they've chosen to interact with.

Since the game performs a system save after each successful confession, the quickest way to progress through the set is to save before someone confesses her love, accept her confession, allow the system save to occur, and then reload the save before her confession, this time rejecting her. This removes her from the dating pool while also allowing the player to get multiple endings per playthrough, which cuts down the total necessary playtime tremendously. I'd also recommend going out of your way to go on bad dates with idols whose confessions you've already received when the only options for dates are idols that have already confessed. By removing idols who have already confessed from the dating pool you can increase the chance of getting dates from idols who have yet to confess and decrease the chance that an idol who has already confessed will make it through the next phase of break-ups instead of someone whose ending you actually need.

[Jurassic Park](https://retroachievements.org/hub/5406?sort=-playersTotal&filter[subsets]=only-games), the critically acclaimed novel turned into one of the biggest movie franchises of all time, has had its fair share of video game adaptations. The games have ranged from standard fare 2D platformers or adventure romps, to more unusual outings like theme park management simulator and even a dino-on-dino fighting game. The Sega CD's crack at the franchise is a point-and-click style adventure game, utilizing everyone's favorite "hot tech" for a brief moment - FMV.

The game takes place shortly after the first movie. A group of scientists is sent to the now abandoned Jurassic Park via helicopter to recover dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately, the nefarious Biosyn Corporation sabotages the helicopter, making it crash, and plans to come to the island to steal the very same eggs. You play as the lone survivor from the helicopter tasked with searching for and rescuing the eggs while also finding a way to escape the island.

The game provides a number of challenges for a short point-and-click adventure. For one, you only have a limited number of in-game hours to complete your task, with every screen. If you don't find enough of the dinosaur eggs before the Biosyn copter arrives and leaves, it's game over. An additional time crunch comes from the eggs themselves - once you rescue the eggs, it's a race against time to load them into an incubator (or, technically, escape the island with them) before the eggs die. If you aren't able to save at least one type of egg before leaving the island, you can kiss your good ending goodbye. The egg locations are typically very far away from the sole incubator in the Visitor Center, meaning you'll likely need either a guide or multiple playthroughs to navigate the fairly strict time limit.

The other main challenge is your resources. Despite being a point-and-click game, the game features a fair amount of "combat." You'll need to shoot various dinos and other dangers with your tranquilizer gun (and later gas gun) to survive your efforts to grab the eggs. Unfortunately, ammo is extremely scarce, meaning you'll need to be very accurate and very selective on when you decide to use your weapons instead of just running. This makes for a tense experience similar to the source material, but also makes for some frustrating clunky combat encounters. The worst part of this is toward the finale - I won't spoil things, but you'll face a forced combat encounter that will be extremely frustrating if not outright impossible if you didn't grab and conserve every bit of ammo possible.

Outside of these frustrations, Jurassic Park is still worth your time. The atmosphere, especially for a Sega CD-era game, is remarkable, with detailed environments and tons of ambient noise, dinosaur roars, and more to keep you immersed - ratcheting up the dramatic thrill and sense of dread Jurassic Park is best known for doing. The acting and general quality of the FMVs are also surprisingly high quality compared to more infamous FMV games of the time like [Night Trap](https://retroachievements.org/game/17011) (although a certain Biosyn member gets a bit too hammy). There's even a solid amount of easter eggs for Jurassic Park fans, which are helpfully featured in the achievement set. If you're a Jurassic Park fan looking for a short, tense adventure on Isla Nublar, give this game a spin.

## SteamGear Mash (Saturn)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Console | Genre                                                                                                        |

SteamGear Mash is a visually striking isometric platformer/shooter hybrid for the Sega Saturn, and its achievement set makes for an excellent challenge run playground. The game starts with a gentle curve to help you learn its multidirectional aiming, momentum-based movement, and suite of subweapons and abilities, but don't be fooled - once the basics click, the true depth of the game starts to shine. The skill ceiling is surprisingly high, and the set takes full advantage of that.

Each boss has its own distinct rhythm and strategy, and take a lot more hits than you might think necessary. Rather than encouraging the easiest or most efficient way to beat each boss, the achievements actively subvert it, forcing you to take on trickier, more technical approaches. You'll often have to avoid using key abilities or subweapons that would normally simplify a fight, pushing you to learn the full depth of boss patterns and game mechanics.

Despite being beatable in under 30 minutes, SteamGear Mash is very challenging to newcomers, and it will take you many deaths to start progressing through the game (don't forget to save! Death takes you to the title screen). And yes - you even get to save two cats along the way.

If you like short, stylish games that reward technical play and feel increasingly fluid the more you master them, this is an underrated Saturn gem worth your time.

## Spanky's Quest (Game Boy)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Console  | Genre  |

Spanky's Quest is a game about a rather round monkey that throws increasingly bigger balls at living fruits. Silly, no? Yeah, I also didn't quite like it at first, but this game is actually worth some of your time for the one reason: the gameplay.

When first playing this game you're introduced to its main mechanic: balls. It does seem like I'm kidding by using fat, monkey, and big balls in the same sentence, but trust me, I'm not. The game is literally that. By throwing up balls and getting them to bounce on your head, they'll get bigger and bigger, indicating a different attack, which can be used in different situations during your gameplay. This, in my opinion, is what makes this game worthy of your time, for it can get pretty damn good once you get the hang of it.

So what I am trying to say is, if you're fond of platformers and want something short and refreshing to play, do give this game a chance.

## \~Hack~ Pokémon Odyssey (Game Boy Advance)

It is no secret that the ROMhacking scene for Pokémon, particularly for its third generation, has exploded in popularity within the last few years. Some hacks opt to focus on a wholly-crafted narrative, often accompanied by original regions, characters, or even brand new Pokémon and forms. Others favor a technical approach, preferring to bring mechanics and features from later iterations or tweaks to better suit a vision. I would like to showcase a hack that blends both of these into something masterful - Pokémon Odyssey.

Starting with one of its strongest aspects in the story, you take on the role of Nyx, a fledgling Trainer from Fibernia and the newest member of Talrega's Adventurer's Guild. Her main goals are to take after her older sister Aimée and investigate both the mysteries surrounding her sister and the Yggdrasil Labyrinth at large. Accompanied by friends Ethan and Olympia, the engaging premise and the journey of character growth the trio embark on make for one of the most memorable plots I have seen in a ROMhack.

Right off the bat, the game encourages you to learn the ins and outs of the Doubles format, a nod to the traditional JRPG battles in the [Etrian Odyssey](https://retroachievements.org/hub/18720) series. This is something very few games in the Pokémon franchise have tackled to the degree of [Colosseum](https://retroachievements.org/game/7423) and [XD](https://retroachievements.org/game/3780). You are given Plusle and Minun, two Pokémon who pair well with one another, to immediately clue you into the importance of team synergy. As you explore the various Stratums of the Labyrinth and assist those residing in them, your teambuilding toolkit only continues to expand and grow. You always have options, even for your favorite Pokémon, to make any Pokémon a valuable member of your team.

As far as the set is concerned, I would recommend it to many types of players. Achievement progression is straightforward for the most part, but becomes somewhat nonlinear as completing Stratums opens up sidequests and new locations to catch Pokémon. Even on the hardest difficulty, it is this nonlinearity, abundance of options, and access to various means of quality of life that allows you to triumph through strategy. The game's level caps are something the set acknowledges to better incentivize solid team composition and planning.

The soundtrack, character writing, and each and every Regional Pokémon act as a love letter to the Etrian Odyssey games and other franchises like [Yu-Gi-Oh!](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7592). While the result would make you believe it would be a disharmonious mess, the result is nothing short of the opposite. Even without prior knowledge, it is still an enjoyable experience. If you're itching for a new ROMhack, come hoist your sword with pride and venture deep into the Labyrinth with this one!

## Pass the Pigs: Let the Good Swines Roll! (Nintendo DS)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Console     | Genre                                                |

As tempting as it is to go all-in on the meme, I'm giving this one a genuine write-up because it's just so bizarre. Pass the Pigs is based on a real life game of the same name. It's like a dice game, but instead of dice, you roll PIGS, and earn points based on the configuration in which they land. There's a risk/reward element at play, too, since you can continue rolling until you either choose to bank what you've earned so far, or roll a PIG OUT (pigs lie on opposite sides) and lose it all.

This video game adaptation takes a few creative liberties to slightly change the experience in comparison to the physical game. There's a bar that fills as you shake the pigs, and rolling with good timing yields better results. You also earn PIG BUCKS which you can spend on accessories for your pigs. They essentially act as weighted dice, increasing your probability of certain types of rolls. There's also a pretty funny story mode, having you travel around the world, facing off against a myriad of opponents who all take Pass the Pigs way too seriously, and inevitably end up baffled that they could lose to some kid.

It's hard to understand why this game exists, or who would even buy it. It would have been fine as a DSiWare release, but as a proper retail DS game it was certainly destined for the bargain bin. It's decently fun for the hour or so it takes to master, though, and it's undoubtedly a one-of-a-kind experience that I'll not soon forget.

This game is a masterpiece, and the set gives you everything you would want. I've always said that the best RetroAchievements sets are the ones that celebrate an interesting game by giving you a guided tour through all the content that a real fan would want to see. It's like you're sitting down to play a game with a friend who recommended it to you, while they point out all of the cool stuff you shouldn't miss.

Wonder Trek's set is exactly that!

First, what is Wonder Trek? Wonder Trek is an obscure Japanese-only action-adventure game where you play the role of a zoologist Nick, wielding a giant, comical ultrasonic hammer, and partnered up with your elderly do-nothing boss, Professor Favreau. He is AI controlled, and while he is occasionally needed to solve a puzzle or two, he mostly (thankfully) stays out of your way (figuratively, not literally; he loves to jump in front of your hammer all the time). The timing is perfect to play this as it just recently got a translation patch, making it finally possible to experience this game in English.

Wonder Trek is dripping with charming writing, quirky art design, and a compelling story with interesting characters and a few twists and turns. You owe it to yourself to play this game, and I don't say those words lightly. The set is worthy of praise as well; light on challenges (a big win for the challenge haters), but it highlights all of the best parts of the 100% playthrough, the best ending, and some guidance toward easily-missable dialogue that is worth seeking out. If you haven't left yet to go play Wonder Trek, I don't know what else I can say.

## Final Fantasy (WonderSwan)

Ever since flying through this year's iteration of the [Four Job Fiesta](https://retroachievements.org/forums/topic/31103) event, I've had a sudden itch to play more Final Fantasy games. My only problem? I had no idea where to start. As someone new to the series, it would make sense to start from the beginning, right? So that's exactly what I did. I didn't have to ponder on which specific version to play since [The Unwanted](https://retroachievements.org/forums/topic/14787) chose it for me. Now after completing the set, I am so happy I got to play Final Fantasy. The set covers everything to really familiarize yourself with the game's world without going too overboard, or more importantly without becoming overwhelming to those getting introduced to the series. Bosses each have challenges that will require you to take advantage of certain game mechanics, or plan out your fight before facing them. Treasure achievements require you to search the world high and low, familiarizing yourself with this new land. Miscellaneous achievements are also here that require you to find easter eggs, or require you to find helpful hidden resources. Overall I had a great time with this, and if anyone else is trying to get into the series, I highly recommend checking this set out.
