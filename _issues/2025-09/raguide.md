# 2) Introduction
The way this guide is set up is a section for each table. There is an image at the top of the section showing the board in normal play followed by the background story given from the game's instruction manual. Next will be a table detailing each of the key elements of the board with information on effects and scoring, each given a letter. The letter in question references the image below the table, showing where the element is on the board. Relevant achievements are listed throughout the guide, with table non-specific ones, including Top-Score achievements, listed in the General Achievements section.

# 3) Tips, Tricks, and General Info

## Bumping the Table

Pressing the B button will cause the table to shake. This is useful for jostling the puck in various ways depending on the situation. If timed right, it might send the puck through a gate or into a bumper or hall. It is also useful for if the puck get stuck in an area and can dislodge it. However, be careful. If the table is shaken too much, it can cause a TILT, disabling the table until the puck falls out of play.

## Cradling and Passing the Puck

Being able to cradle and pass the puck is paramount to making good scores in this game. To cradle means to hold the puck on one of the flippers by keeping it raised. To pass, meaning to send the puck to the other flipper, release the flipper and let the puck fall a short ways before tapping it with the flipper. If done right, the puck should bounce off the corner of the slingshot bumper and arc over to the other flipper. It can be tricky to get a feel for this, especially on UFO with its smaller bumpers, but it is an incredibly useful tech.

## Top-Score Achievements
To earn any Top-Score Achievements, the player must earn over 5,000,000 points on the board. The achievements will be granted upon earning 5,000,000 points, not when a name is entered on the high score table.

## Credits Achievement

Scoring 50,000,000 points on a given board and finishing play will roll the game's credits and is considered "beating" the game in regards to RetoAchievements. This is most quickly done via farming the Jackpot on the UFO board and abusing the High Speed Lane bonus, a tactic used by speedrunners. However, the COLONY board is easier for long play due to the ease of availability of Super Kickbacks and may be better for players looking for a more casual attempt. Reaching the Jackpot is much slower, but also more consistent on the COLONY table.

## Jackpot

The Jackpot for COSMIC is a multi-step process. First, the player must activate the Lane Change three times, setting the lane to length 4. While the Cosmic Warp Lane is at length 4, every time the puck travels the full length, the player earns a Target. Earning five Targets will activate the Jackpot Chance. The player must then hit the puck onto the ramp outside of the Bumper area to launch the puck into the Vortex, netting the Jackpot of 7,000,000 points.

## Target Formations

The main gimmick of this table is the Target Formations. In the middle of the board is a list of Formations. To complete each objective, the player must enter the currently flashing arrays lining the field, sometimes twice. Each time a Formation is completed a bonus is earned and the next Formation objective activate. After all Formations are completed, the Jackpot activates for a limited time, requiring the player to shoot at the Landing Hall, launching the puck into the Jackpot and earning 6,000,000 points.

| :-------- | :----------- |

## Shoot Comets Mini-game

Every so often, Comets will appear on the radar to the left of the table. When the Comets reach the colony, the puck will transform into a gun and the Shoot Comets Mini-game will begin. In this game, six comets will attack the colony, targeting the various arrays. The player must shoot each comet before it collides with its target. Comets will prioritize active arrays and failure to protect them will result in resetting the Target Formation progress of the array.

For scoring, the player starts with a Shield Bonus of 60,000 and loses 10,000 for every Comet not destroyed in time. The Hit Rate is determined by the number of shots hit versus the number of shots made.

The final score formula seems to be as follows, though more experimenting is required:

* If Hit Rate is 100%, Total Bonus = Shield Bonus x 2.
* If Hit Rate is <100%, but more than 10%, Total Bonus = Shield Bonus x [1 + (Hit Rate/100) - 0.1]
* If Hit Rate is <10%, Total Bonus = Shield Bonus x [1 + (Hit Rate/100)]

## Rescue Ship

Shooting the puck into any array that is not lit with earn a RESCUE Target Letter. Spelling RESCUE will summon the Rescue Ship, which will move around the table. If the puck touches the Rescue Ship, it will orbit the ship until the player presses the A button, shooting it in away in the current direction. This can be used to line up shots on trickier arrays to help meet Target Formation objectives. Summoning and using the Rescue Ship does not award any points.

## Flying Bonus

After launching the puck for the first time, the Flying Bonus will activate. The player has 10 seconds to shoot the puck into the Left Blast Off Hall, which will then stop the spinning roulette. The roulette will then determine a bonus multiplier of x10,000, x20,000, or x30,000 and multiply the time remaining on the Flying Bonus timer by it to add to the player's score.

## High Speed Lane

If the player shoots the puck through either the left or right bumper, a Speed Mark will appear on the corresponding side of the High Speed Lane. Hitting the mark will cause the puck to be shot at speed around the High Speed Lane, scoring 30,000 points for each mark hit. If both Speed Marks are active, the puck can bounce between the two, racking up points. After hitting the first mark, if the puck is bounced between marks ten times, a 1 Million point bonus is awarded. This can be earned multiple times before needing to activate the marks again, up to three times if set up fast enough.

## Evil Skeleton

The Jackpot for this table is tied to the Evil Skeleton sequence. To activate this sequence, the player must pass the puck through all four Top Lanes. After doing this, the center UFO Roulette Bumper will light up. Passing the puck through this bumper will cause the UFO to return and replace the bumper area with the Evil Skeleton.

Hitting the puck into the tubes on either side of the Evil Skeleton, or hitting the back of its head, grants 300,000 points. Shooting the puck into its mouth will grant 2 Million points. Shooting the puck into the Evil Skeleton's mouth three times before time is up will cause the Evil Skeleton to explode and grant the Jackpot of 9 Million points.

## U-F-O Bonus

To get the UFO Bonus, the player must collect the three UFO Target Letters.

## Aliens

The main gimmick of the ALIEN board is the Aliens themselves. To summon an Alien, the player must shoot the puck into the Alien's Liar at the top-center of the board. It is flanked by drop targets that can be temporarily removed to make it easier to shoot into the lair. Once summoned, the Alien will replace the three bumpers in the middle of the board for a time. During the time, the player can attack the Alien with the puck. After enough attacks (listed below), the music will change and the arrow to the Alien Target Hall will flash. This means the Alien Bonus is active and shooting the puck into the Alien Target Hall will earn it, most consistently done by cradling the puck in the lower-left flipper and then letting it roll to the end of the flipper before shooting it.

After collecting the Alien Bonus, the Alien is "defeated" and its Lair Bonus becomes active for a short time. To collect the Lair Bonus, the player must shoot the puck into the Alien's Lair to collect it. (The exception to this is the Extra Puck awarded for defeating the Third Alien, which is collected via the Bonus Hall.) Regardless of if the Lair Bonus is collected or not, the player's next entry into the Alien's Lair will summon the next Alien in sequence, meaning Lair Bonuses can be missed until the next time that specific Alien appears.

As for getting to the Alien's Lair, there are two semi-consistent ways and both involve getting the puck to the top-left flipper.

<p style="display:inline-block;">
<img align="right" width="343" height="230" alt="GalacticPinballAlienTLFlipper" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b7dd728-a37f-4bc0-bb38-af495b7acc99" />The first seems to be using the lower-left flipper to tap the puck into the lower Right Drop Target (or where it would be if it's currently dropped), such that the puck bounces to the top-left flipper. The second, as it turns out, involves launching a new puck at full power. So long and the left flipper button is held, the puck should cradle into the top-left flipper.

Once the puck is in the top-left flipper, let it roll down to the end of the flipper. There is a larger, more noticeable star in the background, positioned at the end of the flipper, right above the Left Drop Targets. (See image on the right.) Once the puck intersects the center of the star, that is the timing to launching the puck into the lair.

For the sake of brevity, each Alien Bonus and Lair Bonus has their own achievement, listed below, in order, as well as a table detailing all scoring and required hits. Anyone looking to chase the achievements can abuse the puck launch method for getting into the Alien Lair. However, given the nature of the method, this can only be done a limited number of times per attempt.
</p>

| Alien | Required Hits | Alien Bonus | Lair Bonus                  |
| :---- | :------------ | :---------- | :-------------------------- |
| 1     | 5             | 500,000     | 1,000,000                   |

## A-L-I-E-N Bonus

Hitting the puck into the Alien Target Hall while another bonus is not active will earn an ALIEN Target Letter. The player will get points equal to (Number of Letters) x 50,000 each time they earn a letter, with the Bonus for all five lettering being a Half-Million Bonus.

## Super Kickback

Sending the puck down either Alien's Lane three times will activate the Super Kickback on that side's gutter. Progress for this is displayed via the lights near the Rotating Bumpers. If the player earns the Super Kickback, they do not earn the usual 150,000 points and instead get 0 points for their trip down the lane. The Super Kickback progress will not reset until all Kickbacks are cleared from that side's gutter, with the exception of the Kickback in the gutter at the beginning of the game.

## Rotating Bumpers Bonus

If the player can manage to bounce the puck between the two sets of Rotating Bumpers five times (requires six hits), they will get a 200,000 point bonus.

## Alien Ring Paths

If the player manages to knock down all of the Left and Right Drop Targets with one puck, an Alien Ring Path will appear. There are four paths that seem to cycle, regardless of if their bonuses are earned. Each path rewards 300,000 points if collected and can be collected multiple times if the player is fast enough.

| Path Number | Entrance          | Exit          |
| :---------- | :---------------- | :------------ |
| 1           | Alien's Liar      | Right Flipper |
| 2           | Alien Target Hall | Left Flipper  |
| 3           | Alien's Liar      | Left Flipper  |

# 8) Bonus Stage

</p>

The Bonus Stage can be entered in a variety of ways, detailed below. Per the instruction manual:

"In the bonus Stage, you need to strike the stars with the puck. Hit all 12 for a 1 million bonus! The group of stars will come through four times. When four groups of stars pass or you lose three pucks, whichever comes first, then it is back to the regular table."

Every star collected is worth 5,000 points and collecting every star in a wave earns a 1 Million point bonus.

For those specifically looking for the achievement, getting into the Bonus Game seems most easily done on the COLONY table as the chute to the Center Dome can be easily shot into multiple times in a row. To earn the achievement, the player just needs to collect every star in a single "wave" to get a 1 Million point bonus for the wave.
