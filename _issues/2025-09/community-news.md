## RA Awards

The 5th annual RA Awards has started. The RA Awards are the community's opportunity to highlight their favorite sets, developers, contributors, and community members from the prior year. Check out the `# rawards-discussion` and `#rawards-voting` channels in Discord for more details.

## User Code of Conduct Updates

A common question that surfaces on RetroAchievements is in regards to having open multiple sessions of a game, and the distinction between what is and isn't allowed. From that the [Global Leaderboard and Achievement Hunting Rules](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/users/global-leaderboard-and-achievement-hunting-rules.html) has been updated to include the following:

**9. Do not control multiple games at the same time with singular inputs.**

>   Do not control multiple games at the same time with singular inputs.
>   You should not gain an unfair advantage over other players by controlling more than one game at the exact same time with any inputs. This is not limited to multiple instances of the same game, but in general.
>  
>   Examples:
>   - Controlling multiple instances of the same game to increase your odds at a luck-based achievement.
>   - Controlling different RPG games and repeating battles for grinding purposes with the same inputs.
>  
>   Note that this rule does not apply to having open multiple sessions but not controlling them at the same time. For example, it is allowed to play a game, then pause it to practice the same game in a different instance or play a different game entirely, be it on the same device or another. This is allowed as long as no more than a single game is receiving inputs at the exact same time.

## Hash Compatibility Testing

The QA-team is happy to announce a new process for hash compatibility testing! This allows users to help test hash compatibility for existing sets. You can work with the developer on testing new hashes while mastering the set to verify compatibility. Below are some of the recently linked hashes. 

| Game                                           | Console            | Hash Type                        | Tester                     | Link Date    |

## Site Updates

### RAWeb 2025.08.20
**Highlights for Players**
- Dutch is now a selectable locale option on your settings page. Thanks @AxelNL for your contributions with this!
- DMs will now auto-open to the last page.
- The Downloads page now shows warnings on emulators where developers can't access development/debugging tools to easily resolve tickets.
- Mobile game lists now always show achievement and point counts while unsorted.

**Highlights for Developers**
- Tickets have a new "Unable to debug due to no toolkit support" close reason.
- Game badge and achievement icon uploads in the management app should be more resilient and throw fewer errors.

[Full release notes here](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/releases/tag/2025.08.20)

### RAWeb 2025.08.28
**Highlights for Players**
- We've added a dedicated page to feature our Patrons. Without them, we wouldn't be able to keep our 3(!) servers up and running: [Check it out here](https://retroachievements.org/community/patreon-supporters)
- The Reorder Site Awards page has a new "Reset Order" button, thanks to code contributions by @wololo.
- Global search now shows a game's points.
- You may notice the site loads slightly faster - several pages are now shipping 50% less JavaScript.

**Highlights for Developers**
- Disabling emails for comments on achievements you've created works now.
- If you have access to a team account (Events, QAM, DevC, RAdmin, etc), you can now post new forum topics, edit replies, and post replies without needing to switch accounts.
- If you use a team inbox on Discord, long messages will no longer be truncated after 2000 characters.
- If you use a team inbox on Discord, on-site replies to threads will now automatically be added to the existing forum topic rather than creating new forum topics with the same subject.

Additionally, this release includes changes to features that are currently alpha/WIP.
