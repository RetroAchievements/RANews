## VS. Duck Hunt (Arcade)

This is an updated arcade version of [Duck Hunt](https://retroachievements.org/game/1669) where multiple new features were added, including a 2 player mode, bonus stages, between level cutscenes, and you can finally shoot that smug cheeky dog! Stages also alternate between the NES version of games A/B and game C. None of the Nintendo VS. arcade releases have a set yet, so this would be a great opportunity to make great sets on these special versions of these games. For example, some of the other games in the series like [VS. Super Mario Bros.](https://retroachievements.org/game/29634) and [VS. Castlevania](https://retroachievements.org/game/29615) are harder arrangements of the NES releases, while others like VS. Wrecking Crew and [VS. Dr. Mario](https://retroachievements.org/game/29617) support head to head multiplayer that isn't found in their home console counterparts.

I’ll be real with you right from the start: Eggs of Steel: Charlie’s Eggcellent Adventure is not a great game to play. It’s not what I’d call an Eggcellent game, either! I wouldn’t say it’s terrible or anything, but compared to all the quality platformers you can find on the PS1, it doesn’t stand a chance. Jumping feels wrong, its fixed camera means lots of tricky to read jumps, there’s a lack of environment variety, and its difficulty plus lack of checkpointing can make it a proper pain to get through at times. However, it’s such a bizarre experience, one that masterfully catches the player off-guard when they least expect it, that I think it’s essential gaming for anyone interested in exploring the wackier side of the medium. I play Japanese PS1 games regularly with the intention of finding the strangest stuff on the platform, and this game manages to out-weird most of them, which is no small feat!

While the gameplay is unusually quaint within the context of its 1998 release, it’s really the story and characters that give this one its rarely mentioned but well-deserved reputation. It all comes back to the protagonist, Charlie; instead of a cute mascot or a go-getter hero that everybody loves, Charlie just plain sucks. He’s a factory watchman who doesn’t care about his job at all and only got in because he knows someone high up in the factory. The game’s events are set into motion purely because he goofed off and caused a major accident. Nobody else likes him except his girlfriend, who sends you aggressively horny letters throughout the game. In fact, the antagonist is a fellow factory worker who hates Charlie so much that he wants him dead! In order to unravel the plot and figure out why exactly Charlie is so despised, you’ll have to find letters scattered throughout the game. You might be tempted to root for Charlie since he’s the protagonist, but without going into spoilers, I can assure you that Charlie deserves nothing but the worst.

As long as you can deal with some challenging platforming, there’s a good chance Eggs of Steel will stick with you as it has for me. The weirdly jaunty soundtrack doesn’t fit the game at all, but it’ll absolutely worm its way into your head. The pre-rendered backgrounds aren’t the most conducive for good platforming, but they sure do look cool. As annoying as some parts can be, the levels contain a good variety of ideas and the bosses aren’t slouches by any means. It’s an adventure, it’s a journey, it’s an ordeal, but Eggs of Steel is worth playing just to remind yourself that video games can still shock and delight even if you’ve been playing them for decades. I first played this game as a joke not knowing what it was or what it contained, only to end up on the other side inspired enough to write video game reviews for a website and do a weekly game blog of my own!

## Airforce Delta Strike (PlayStation 2)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Console       | Genre                                                               |

When I played Airforce Delta Strike a few years ago, what really hooked me was the combination of intense air combat and its unique story, told in a visual novel style with cutscenes that added depth to the experience. The narrative follows the Delta Squadron, a group of misfit pilots tasked with defending Earth from a rebellious space colony. Adding achievements to this game would enhance this experience by encouraging players to dive deeper into both the gameplay and the story. With over 130 unlockable aircraft and more than 60 missions, achievements tied to mastering certain planes, completing missions with specific characters, or uncovering hidden story elements would make exploring the game even more rewarding.

Roll Initiative. Ouch, rolled a nat 20, GM gets first actions.

Within the deep library of the PSP, comes another [D&D](https://retroachievements.org/hub/3246) based adventure, the last one to NOT be set in the Forgotten Realms, in fact. It has interesting concepts, decent loot, and more importantly, a fun way to make/explore your own characters. Play as the core character classes of 3.5, with two non-core classes in the form of the Psion and the Psychic Warrior. You then form a party of what you'd prefer to then take the 30+ missions that are available in the game. There’s also a good/evil path in the scenarios, each leading to different quests.

Ignoring the UI issues, it has dragons, cool tactical combat, and making my numbers go up. It may not be the greatest game around, but it can strike your fancy, even if you aren't a huge D&D nerd.

Have you ever wanted a solid 3D platformer with an awesome combat system that's easy to pick up, but hard to master? Then the game you’re looking for is Legend of Kay! In this game you take control of the young cat warrior in training, Kay, as he takes it upon himself to fight back against the invading rat and gorilla armies. What awaits Kay as he travels the lands of the cats, rabbits, frogs, and pandas searching for the rat Alchemist Tak and the imposing gorilla Minister Shun?

For anyone looking for a great 3D Zelda-like adventure, Legend of Kay will fill that void. The game has a fun combat system, multiple weapons, interesting items, and fun puzzles/mini-games. The game does have difficult spikes from time to time, but those spikes never feel like they overstay their welcome (until the end of the game of course). Those who want a tougher challenge can play through the game on hard or even nightmare difficulty. Those difficulties are really only there for the bragging rights, which makes it a perfect game to make achievements for. Personally, I believe there is even potential for a challenge run subset with absurdly difficult challenges like beating the whole game with only the basic sword, or without using any items except when bombs are needed.

All in all, even if Legend of Kay doesn't get a set anytime soon, I hope I've done enough to convince someone out there to at least give this game a try! For those who just can't wait for a set for this game, there is "Legend of Kay: Anniversary" which released with basic achievements on Xbox 360, PS4/PS5, and Steam.

Alright guys, let's talk. Seriously, this is not a small deal.

Maybe you guys remember playing the hit game Project Gotham Racing 2 back in the early Xbox 360 days, before XBLA became a thing. There was that one random minigame which was like [Asteroids](https://retroachievements.org/game/15009) on crack with funny neon colors and explosions everywhere. You got addicted to that dumb minigame. Turns out it wasn't as dumb as you thought, because now Geometry Wars is known as a classic Xbox Live Arcade title. It even got a few sequels. Then BAM! We got Geometry Wars: Galaxies on the Nintendo Wii and DS.

It’s a fully fledged game with around 50 stages. You unlock several drones which you can select one per level, level up by playing the game more, and collect gold medals because you are awesome at the game. It goes pow pow and you go pew pew at the speed of light and it is amazing. No touch control needed, so that would please DS lovers that hate emulating touch control. Leaderboards for highscores would be a big win, and the lack of twin shooters in here would make this game a great addition for our awesome community.

And so, until we get Wii, more cool twin shooters to play.

I believe Cotton Boomerang: Magical Night Dreams is worthy of having a set to play. Although it's a remixed version of [Cotton 2: Magical Night Dreams](https://retroachievements.org/game/3604) which already has a set, it's in my opinion better than Cotton 2, as it offers multiple playable characters and better graphics. Gameplay-wise, it’s less complex than Cotton 2, as its style is more of a shoot-em up (much like [Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams](https://retroachievements.org/game/11870)), rather than relying on you to chain enemies throughout the stages. The more balanced difficulty makes it more fun for players to pick up. It also supports multiplayer and has a score-based ranking system like Cotton 2 that could lead to an interesting set.

I definitely wish to see a set of this game. Is it an easy game? Nope, but its learning curve makes it really worthwhile to play.

Imagine playing [Grand Theft Auto](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8759), but you get to be a mech when you're not a car. Also, it's for a console only a bit more powerful than a pregnancy tester. That's Transformers: Autobots and Transformers: Decepticons, a pair of DS titles created to tie in with the first Michael Bay movie.

The games run in the same engine, but have different stories and missions to match. For an example of how they do this well, the first boss in both games is a battle to the death against the main protagonist of the other version. There's a decent variety of objectives in the story missions, with combat, search and destroy, escort, and chase segments just to name some. There are score-attack style side missions scattered throughout each open-world hub with their own medal system, providing easy benchmarks for achievements. Lastly, the game lets you scan most vehicles, with each one having different stats in both vehicle and Transformer states, which could provide good optional challenges to complete missions using sub-par or humorously themed vehicles.

Unusually for licensed games for the DS, each game has its own fully voiced original script, with a cast including Peter Cullen, Steve Blum, Keith David, and more. Most are absolutely fantastic in their roles, telling two interesting stories that mercifully focus on the Transformers far more than on humans. The games are far from perfect; certain missions aren't great, the camera system is fairly awkward, and the graphics struggle to represent the ultra-detailed designs they were contractually obligated to use. However, they're undeniably far more than meets the eye, created by people who likely cared a whole lot more for the original source material than most of the people making the movie did. I'd love to see someone do them justice; they're two of the most underrated titles for the platform.

With a name like Iggy's Reckin' Balls, you might be expecting a game chock full of punk rock, bad grammar, demolition, and iguana owner culture, but you'd be pretty far off the mark. Reckin' Balls stars the titular Iggy and his friends, various anthropomorphic spheres with long tongues they can use to grapple onto platforms, switches, and even other players. At its heart, this is a racing game. You advance by winning races in circuits, which in turn unlocks new circuits full of new races as well as new characters that you can play as. Two things set the mechanics of this game apart from other racing or karting games, though. The first is that most of the levels have a degree of verticality to them, requiring you to grapple and platform upwards as you make your way up "towers" - think rings of racetracks floating on top of each other. In this way you could consider it a type of "platforming racer". The second is the ability to attack other players with a grapple. Using the grapple, you can grab an opponent in front of you and lift them over your head, slamming them to the ground behind you, momentarily stunning them. You can also grab an opponent and swing them around horizontally, throwing them completely off the tower (is this still considered defenestration, despite the complete lack of window? Not sure...).

So why wish this set? Sounds like a cousin game, right? WRONG. I believe there are 5, if not more, reasons that you should burn a set request on this in the hopes a dev picks it up.

First, this game has a ton of unlockables, including new characters and new tracks. I know you love collecting things, I mean, it's part of why you belong to this community, yea? Now imagine hearing that satisfying sound of an achievement popping each time you unlock something new. Yup, that's very nice.

Second, this game is challenging! I have never completed a playthrough completely solo. I probably could, but have always enjoyed attacking this challenge with a group of friends. An achievement set would allow me (and you!) to push ourselves to master new skills and add another badge to the wall by putting in the time with this amazing game.

Third, it has multiplayer, so not only can you enjoy this with some friends on the couch, there is also the potential for a multiplayer subset, meaning you can get even more achievement bang for your game buck.

Fourth, you've likely never played a game that fuses platforming and racing in such a unique way. While there absolutely are similar games, and speed running of various games is definitely a thing, I think the blend of genres and competition in this does create a totally new experience from anything else out there in the world of retro or modern video games.

Finally, you will fall in love with the vibe of the game. You might be off put at first by seeing such a new type of gameplay, or might laugh at the dated music. Trust me, this is temporary; the more you play this game, the more you will fall in love with its crazy cast of characters, unique gameplay, and before long you might even find the main theme song worming its way into your brain.

Do you need more reasons? No. You don't. Go request this set now and you won't regret it. Unless of course, you really are a big fan of punk rock, bad grammar, demolition, iguana owner culture, and literally nothing else. Then you might be happier at a ska concert.

Pokemon XG: NeXt Gen is a romhack of [Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness](https://retroachievements.org/game/3780). It introduces future gen mechanics in the game, like the physical and special split from Gen 4, the Fairy type from Gen 6, and even some Alolan forms from Gen 7. The main story and gameplay is the same, but the number of obtainable Pokemon (both Shadow and regular) is vastly increased. The difficulty has also been increased, giving most trainers more strategy and making the battles much more clutch than in the original. A lot of Shadow moves were added, like Shadow Half (halves a Pokemon's HP), Shadow Hunter (super effective on other Shadow Pokemon), and Shadow Rain (Rain Dance, but hurts non-shadow Pokemon), which can make you think twice about purifying your Pokemon too soon. There are also some minor changes to the dialogue.

In my opinion, this is the best way to experience Pokemon XD, and it is a fantastic hack for anyone who is a fan of the original.
