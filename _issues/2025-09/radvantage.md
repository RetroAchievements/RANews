| {% raachpic 131676, 145080, Trophy General %} | Recruit Xavier in Chapter 18. | 25     |


**Recommended Units**: Ralph, Dalsin - put S Drink in their inventory if they are too fatigued, then deploy them. To recruit Xavier, have Leif speak to him, after the citizen green units speak to all eight unique enemy knights. If any citizen or knight dies, you can no longer get Xavier. Long story short, the big issue is converted knights start attacking the enemy and end up losing the battle!!

**The solution**: Sleep Sword (from Ch.16A/16B). Enemies hurt by it are immediately put to sleep. The citizens can still talk to sleeping knights, and status lasts the whole map in Thracia. This is also the same strategy we use to get the elusive SSS Rank, but let's try to make this simple for now.

Ralph is ideal to wield the Sleep Sword. At base level he has enough weapon rank, can damage the knights while not being able to kill with a critical hit by accident, and is not able to be OHKOed by an enemy followup crit, but other characters can use it if able.

First, deal with all the immediate enemies and block or survive the Lopto reinforcements until Turn 22. Open one of the doors to the final room and wait for the knights to come to the chokepoint. Take this chance to snipe the Friege soldiers mixed in with the group.

With one other character that has higher defense than Ralph, funnel their movement to one enemy at a time, and knock them all out one by one with the Sleep Sword. Multiple enemies cannot be on the same tile, but they can still pass through sleeping units, just not your units. Because of this, have one of your characters next to the sleeping enemy to create a natural wall, then move either Ralph or the other character back one tile so it's only possible for one enemy to move in to attack Ralph.

Only open the citizen room after all knights are asleep. The citizens tend to to try talking to the wrong enemy, so you will need to have your units hold onto them so the other citizens can move to talk to them. You will probably want someone with high enough constitution to rescue/drop the converted green knights because they can obstruct characters from moving.
(Dalsin often caps constitution, and this chapter has the Body Ring if he somehow does not have enough)

Finally, when all eight knights have been converted into green units, bring Leif outside Xavier's attack range then talk to recruit him. Enjoy having the hardest general of them all, and the only recruitable unit that has Pavise; something that even a promoted Dalsin doesn't get.
