Jill Valentine is shooting her way through a destroyed Raccoon City to find a way to escape. On her way out she does not only protect herself against zombies that are lurking behind every corner, but also a giant mutant that is just hunting for her. What's even worse, in all this mess there seems to be some group that still finds time to mess with the environment. Can you find all 10 differences?
