Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

Who could have seen this coming: Dr. Wily turns out to be evil and wants to take over the world! But this time, he will succeed. After all, he got a silly hat! Don't underestimate the power of hats.

There's always time for a selfie! Yoshi is hanging around in his own game Yoshi's Story, with a great black-and-white filter on top of his picture with a flower.

If you are looking for umm... "interesting" crossovers, then s0uth has you covered. NiGHTs is on their way to protect the dreams, and gets help from the one, the only... Eric Cartman?!

It's a classic sight as any: Link is ready to go on another adventure through the Hyrule fields, accompanied by his trusty horse Epona and his umm, trusty helper Navi!

More Pok√©mon battles coming our way in Viridian Forest, with Beedrill duking it out against a shiny-looking Bulbasaur. Actually, interrupt that battle, someone needs to catch that Bulbasaur!

And on the other side of the forest, we have a Pikachu duking it out with Flareon. Their attacks seem to be matching each other... I wonder who will be the first to overpower the other?

Now this takes me back: a painting made through Mario Paint! Totempanic here has made a picture of an Alice fumo doll from the Touhou series.

And to close off the day, we have a painting of Shadow Mario from Super Mario Sunshine! Look at him standing there all cutesy and innocent, even with a heart-shaped flower! He would never be evil right?
