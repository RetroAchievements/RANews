| {% raachpic 455286, 514647, Toon City Tour %} | Perform 11 different Negative Reactions in Toon City in one visit | 10     |

To unlock this achievement, you must get 11 different reactions at any time during one visit to the level. As long as you stay in the area (either by waiting to complete every audition in Story mode or not leaving Freeride), you will retain your progress. For each reaction, there is at least one place where you can trigger it by pressing X at the right time. You can go about getting them in a few ways, such as completing the tutorials in Story mode or roaming freely in Rehearsal or Freeride mode.

Here is one path you can take to get every reaction:

- At the start, move to the port-a-potty on the right to get the Paint reaction.
- Hit the buzzsaw on the left when you come out for the Decap reaction.
- Jump onto the burning oil drum for Fire.
- Combo from the drum into the dynamite for Bomb.
- Make a right out of the starting area, then ram into the spinning hammer for Accordion.
- On the same building as the hammer is a pair of doors used for Flatten.
- Inside the building is a spike trap to jump onto for Puncture.
- Leave the building and go back up the stairs, then across the bridge. Vert up the ramp ahead, then grind the rail on the left. Appeal near the end of the crane for Fallin'.
- After a brief scene, you'll get the Cylinder reaction as well.
- Continue down the road in front of you, taking two right turns. After you do, you'll see a restaurant with a door used for Pinch.
- Get back on the road and continue down it until you see a stomping robot. Get under one of its feet and appeal for the Box reaction, and the achievement.
