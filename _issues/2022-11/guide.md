# Overview

### The achievements can be grouped into a few types.

- Story Achievements (these cannot be missed).
- Side Quests (There are 2 side quests in the game. They can be attempted at any time in the game).
- Shadowruns related.
- Matrix related.
- Other miscellaneous types (Like collect all contacts, buy specific items, etc.).

### General Roadmap / Missable Achievements Walkthrough

- Any starting class is fine, it only affects the very early stage of the game. You can always hire companions to complement your team.
- Hire any shadowrunner for the short term, then sell their items for easy money.
- Grind `Gunderson` and buy the `Predator Pistol` and `Armor Jacket` as soon as possible.
- Try to raise your `Reputation` to 5, then buy the `Ork Armband` as soon as possible.
- Try to raise your `Electronics` to 5. Buy `Invisibility` (or hire `Ricky`) to repeat early Corp Runs from `Mortimer Reed`.
- Next, target to raise your `Electronics`, `Charisma`, and `Reputation` to 6. And earn the money to buy `Electronic Kit` and `Security Pass` (aka. Corp badges).
- You should be able to complete all the stealth runs at this point. You don't have to do it now, but just keep this in mind: Every main mission that involves a corp run, there is a stealth achievement for it.
- You should already have a permanent team by now, let them stay in the team while grinding so they can earn karma too.
- You should be able to clear all the missable achievements by this point. Make sure to do it before proceeding too far into the main plot!
- Grind mid-level Corp Runs (from `Celeb` or `Julius`), and save up to buy the `Fuchi Cyber-5` Cyberdeck.
- Depending on your confidence level, either repeat the mid-level Matrix Run or the Renraku Corp Run from `Celeb` to earn money and karma while upgrading your deck.
- Focus on the Cyberdeck's `Response` and `Masking`. Once you are confident enough, start grinding high-level Matrix Run (from `Celeb`) for money and karma. You will need a lot of money and karma to complete all the achievements.
- Just grind the high-level Matrix Run until you are feeling confident to finish the main plot of the game. It is up to you whether to grind for all the achievements first, or finish the game first and come back. If you think the grind is too much, you could grind just enough for the most expensive item in the game (the `Fairlight Excalibur`), then just save-buy-load for the rest of the items.

# Story Achievements

You will earn these just by progressing through the story. With the exception of ***SIX*** special ones listed first.

### Special Story Achievements

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/214234.png) | **SLOT OFF, FRAG-FACE!!**<br>_Enter Matchsticks alone and unarmed and defeat Ito Ogami and his thugs using just your fists (hand razors and spurs are ok)_ | **:warning::warning: MISSABLE :warning::warning:**<br>Make a save before confronting him in the `Matchsticks`. Arm yourself with `Spurs`, dismiss all your companions, and then go in and punch everyone to death. Just load your game after that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/214250.png) | **This One's Personal**<br>_Go to Elysia's Tomb alone and unarmed and defeat Thon and his thugs using only your fists (hand razors and spurs are ok)_      | This is the final boss, you can always reload the game after you beat him, so I wouldn't consider this missable.<br><br>- Get the `Spurs` if you do not already have it.<br>- Wear the best armor you can.<br>- Bring a full inventory of `Medkits`, and spam heal every time your HP drop below half.<br>- Having high `Body`, `Strength`, and `Melee Combat` is a must.<br>- Having high `Biotech` helps on healing.<br>- Maxing these stats will make it very easy. |

### Stealth Achievements for Story Missions

When progressing thru the story, there are some missions require you to enter a corp run to extract either a package or a person. Below achievements are unlocked if you managed to complete these without triggering any alarm.

Tips:
- Raise your `Electronics` and `Charisma` to 6.
- Buy `Electronic Kit`, or better yet, `Level 5 Maglock Passkey`.
- Buy `Security Pass` (aka Corp Badges).
- Save before entering, and reload a save if you failed.
- Just choose "Walk Away" for every random encounters.

### Stealth Achievements

Complete any corp runs without triggering any alarm of using invisibility.

Tips:
- Raise your `Electronics` and `Charisma` to 6.
- Buy `Electronic Kit`, or better yet, `Level 5 Maglock Passkey`.
- Buy `Security Pass` (aka Corp Badges).
- Save before entering, and reload a save if you failed.
- Just choose "Walk Away" for every random encounters.
- You will pop the achievement when you return to the Johnson to claim your reward.

# Matrix Side Quest

Below achievements requires you to log into Matrix systems, do some stuffs, and then crash the CPU. Most of them will require a pretty high-level decking capabilities, including a moderately upgraded Cyberdeck, a good decker, and some good programs.

I recommend starting these after you have at least
- The `Fuchi Cyber-5` Cyberdeck
- Max `Response` upgrade.
- At least 6 in your `Masking` upgrade.
- At least level 5 in your `Attack` and `Deception` program.
- At least 6 in your `Computing` skill (hiring `Rianna` is a good choice).
- Enough Cyberdeck memory to load `Attack`, `Deception`, and a `Tar Pit` fodder (Slow and Analyze).

Search online for more in-depth Matrix run strategies.

Beware the first node contains a guaranteed `Tar Pit`, so get your fodder ready. |

## Matrix Run

You can keep asking `Celeb` for Matrix run, accept them to store the system passcode, and then cancel them. The "interesting datafiles" are stored in various data stores, so just try to download at least once in every data store you encounter until you manage to "find nothing interesting". If you found something interesting, navigate to the CPU to crash it.
