## Intro

This is a place where achievement creators (and sometimes their fans) can advertise their work and tell the community why they should play those games.

Our idea is to post up to 10 "Play This Set" per month. If you want to advertise your set (or a set you're a big fan of), write a couple of paragraphs and send us a message (go to {% rauser RAdmin %} page and then "Send Private Message").

**NOTE**: don't get frustrated if your article isn't published in the next issue! If yours is not present here, it'll probably be present in a future RANews issue.

The only word I can describe this hack with is "Greatness". Yea sure, this hack has some low points, but there are features unique to this hack that make those low points actually fun.

This hack is the largest collab in terms of size and amount of creators in SMW community not counting contest compliation hacks. The difficulty of it forms a really nice curve, from something slightly harder than vanilla to some levels that looks scary.  

Content of the level itself ranges from simple levels styled after SMB3, to some crazy and really well thought out gimmicks.

Dragon coin system rewards exploration, as getting those will let you unlock permanent power-ups to aid you on your journey.

If I had to recommend one hack to an experienced player, I would pick this one

Set and writeup by {% rauserpic KingS1zzle %}

Vib-Ribbon is a Rhythm game created by NanaOn-Sha, the same developers as Parappa and Um Jammer Lammy. Vib-Ribbon is a very unique game that not only loads the software into the Playstation's ram, but also lets the player use any music CD to generate new levels to play on.

The graphics for Vib-Ribbon are pretty basic, due to the ability for custom music, but the music tracks that are included are pretty wild. There are 6 tracks provided by a band named "Laugh and Peace" and each of them have interesting lyrics and tempo changes.

Provided in the set is not only achievements for the 6 included songs but also 6 additional achievements for custom songs. Inside the game's fourm post, there is a lenthy step by step guide on how to create your own CD for Vib-Ribbon.

Writeup by {% rauserpic SherryBirkin %}

Hi! I'm here again. This time to present another game from the Ace Attorney franchise.  

Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth,  is the fifth game in the Ace Attorney series, taking place about a month after the third game. The game play became more interactive, with the player now able to move around the crime scene. The "Logical" feature added by which deductions relating to facts can be made.  

For those new to this franchise, it's of a visual novel with more details of investigation. The game is centered around moving Edgeworth to different locations and interacting with different objects and people by examining the former and talking to the latter.

The other main phase of the game are "arguments", which are similar to cross-examinations in the core Ace Attorney games.  

Below I will be listing the episodes and a synopsis that accompany this game:  

1. Turnabout Visitor  
A murder occurs in Miles Edgeworth's office upon his return from working abroad that he must now investigate.  
2. Turnabout Airlines  
While on a plane home, Edgeworth is accused of a murder and must find the real culprit in order to clear his name.  
3. The Kidnapped Turnabout  
Edgeworth finds himself wrapped up in another murder as he meets a rival investigator and an old friend from his past.  
4. Turnabout Reminiscence  
Seven years ago, Edgeworth's first trial is interrupted by the discovery of the bodies of the previous prosecutor and the defendant.  
5. Turnabout Ablaze  
A fire and double homicide at a foreign embassy leads Edgeworth, to a final showdown with the Yatagarasu.  

Are you curious?  
Our dear old characters are also back, and some of them like Easter-Eggs,The set will introduce all of them to you. Enter this adventure full of mysteries to solve, prove your innocence and be a prosecutor who faces anything. In the end you won't stop screaming, Objection!!!

Set and writeup by {% rauserpic BlotchJBMR %}

The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends is a hard set.  Old school hard filled with Game Boy Style.  Filled with six stages and three mini boss fights, Rocky and Bullwinkle is short but don't let that fool you!

Collect-a-thons will have you exploring every level inside out, and better too as the damageless achievements will require learning and memorization, mastering the controls and maybe some luck.

Making it to the end of the game might prove difficult so grabbing the extra life achievements along the way might be worthwhile, though none of that will matter in the whopping fifty-point deathless run achievement.

If you're ready to save your favorite Minnesotan animals, cry in pain and discover Kevin, check out The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends for Game Boy today!

Hi people, this is my first review and I want to dedicate it to Goof Troop (I hope you enjoy).

It's for sure a wonderful game, with its mix of action and puzzles in a simple but well made gameplay. It has a remarkable Original Soundtrack and a high replay factor. It's a nice choice to play (or replay) with the additional challenges of provided by the RetroAchievements.

The challenges of this achievement set may seem complicated, but as you play, learn and remember the mechanics and memorizing the areas, the game becomes easier (even not being that good in this game I was able to do a speedrun).

A half of the achievements are progress based, playing with the two available characters Goofy and Max. Goofy is stronger and can beat most of the enemies with 1 hit, while Max needs 2 hits in some of them, however Max is faster than Goofy while moving.

The portion of the achievements is to collect lives, continues, fruits and some other goals in each one of the 5 stages. The most hard ones are the ones for beating the stages without collecting any fruit and not having more than 2 lives. It seems tough, but you just need to be careful to not get any fruit and if you have less than 2 lives, get a ruby (which gives an extra life) and don't go above the limit. You'll also need to memorize some parts and the bosses' mechanics.

For those who are willing to play or replay this game with a new approach, it worths each second of fun. It was undoubtedly one of the sets I had more fun here on RA, besides the high dose of nostalgia by seeing this game once again after years.




## ~Homebrew~ Zooming Secretary (NES)

Set and writeup by {% rauserpic meleu %}

I'm a big fan of well made homebrews. Although I wouldn't say that Zooming Secretary is a masterpiece, it's surely well made. The game is simple, short and fun. And the achievement set adds a little spice to the game.

You're a secretary who has to answer phone calls. When a phone rings, it shows the subject you need to address and then you must go to the appropriate file cabinet to "remember" that topic and then answer the call. You can only hold one topic in your head at a time, so you need to be fast if the next call is about a different topic. Don't let the caller waiting too much, or they'll give up. And if you miss five calls you're fired! (you have infinite continues, though)

In some stages there are some NPCs trying to hinder you. The boss slows you down with useless blabbering, the gossip-girl can leave you confused and swap over the topic currently held in your single-track mind... Fortunately there's also a coffee machine to provide you with a caffeine-fuelled speed boost.

Besides the typical progression based achievements, there are also some challenges exploring a bit more the game's features. Such as beating the game without being fired, without losing a call, without drinking coffee, drinking a lot of coffees, not wasting time chatting with the NPCs, and others.

And here's a hint for aspiring achievement creators: homebrew's memory is usually well-behaved, which makes this kind of game a good choice for your first set(s).

Writeup by {% rauserpic Blazekickn %}

Usually with these ~Unlicensed~ games, they are poorly made and only created to steal money from unsuspecting customers. This demake of Pokemon Yellow, however, is surprisingly close to the real thing! Kanto is all here and accounted for - although all the areas are redesigned, making it more or a rom hack of the original than a remake. Also much like a rom hack, the game is way harder. Battles give you less experience and movesets have been balanced to make stronger pokemon less overpowered, so unless you want to grind for hours you will have to build a full team and use your brain to win. 

Making a team isn't much of an issue though, as there are many updates to the game that make it more of a fun process. For one, much like the Pickup ability in the Generation III games you sometimes get random item drops after winning battles. This includes the normal battle items, such as Potions and Ethers, as well as TMs. Yes, you have a random chance to get any TM in the game when you win battles, including moves like Ice Beam, Earthquake, Psychic, etc. This makes training new Pokemon way easier, as you'll have access to good moves for them as long as you KO enough Pokemon. I got TM26 Earthquake pretty early on, so I decided to catch a Geodude in Mt. Moon and used him on my team, which is something I wouldn't normally do playing in the main series games since all I would have at that point is stuff like Rock Throw and Mud-Slap.

HMs are also treated as Key Items rather than you being required to teach them to your Pokemon, much like in the newer games. No more needing to catch HM Slaves to avoid teaching your Charmander Cut, or even building your team to have a Water type for Surf and a Flying type for Fly. Just focus on building your team of six for the tough battles.

The game is definitely a bit unpolished, but it's still worth checking out if you're a fan of Pokemon.
