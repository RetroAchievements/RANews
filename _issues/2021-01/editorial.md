## Intro

Let's check what was done to move the RetroAchievements project forward over
this last crazy year. Grouped by the different fronts where the project evolves.

I'd like to say thanks to all the guys involved here. Please stay safe and let's
make 2021 another great year for RA.


## Emulation

### New Supported Consoles

- MSX
- 3DO
- PC-FX
- Vectrex
- Magnavox Odyssey 2

By the way, if you're wondering "why the heck RetroAchievements programmers
add support to some random consoles no one cares about?!", I explained why that
happens in an episode of the RAPodcast. [Here's a link directly to the part where I talk about it](https://youtu.be/49vgbPt9MWA?t=734).


### RetroArch

Over the last year {% rauser Jamiras %} had made a lot of contributions in the
RetroArch front. I'm gonna list some of most notable contributions (when the author
is not mentioned, it means {% rauser Jamiras %}):

- Added Rich Presence support (yeah, we didn't have RP in RetroArch before).
- Display measured progress on locked achievements in Achievements List.
- Option to start a session with all achievements active (by {% rauser meleu %}).
- Report an error message when failing to unlock an achievement in the server.
- Added option to play custom sound on achievement unlock
- Show "unsupported core" when viewing Achievement List from an unsupported core
- And several other bug fixes and small improvements.


### RALibretro

- Nintendo 64 support - by {% rauser Jamiras %}
- OpenGL Hardware rendering - by {% rauser gde %}
- Keyboard support (useful/mandatory for MSX) - by {% rauser gde %}
- And several other bug fixes and small improvements - by {% rauser Jamiras %}


## Achievement Creation Tools

New achievement logic features, all implemented by {% rauser Jamiras%}:

- [OrNext](https://docs.retroachievements.org/AndNext-and-OrNext-Flags/)
- [BitCount](https://docs.retroachievements.org/BitCount-Size/)
- [MeasuredIf](http://docs.retroachievements.org/Measured-Flag/)

Also the extremely useful [Memory Inspector's continuous filtering](http://docs.retroachievements.org/Memory-Inspector-Overview/#2-filter)


## Website

2020 was another year where we didn't see the version 2 of the website. Yeah, the
pandemics is affecting everyone's life, even more the life of those who are
parents. And that's the case for the people responsible for the RAv2.

Regardless, we still got some improvements on the current version of the website,
mainly made by {% rauser MrOwnership %}.

Listing some of most notable improvements (when the author is not mentioned, it
means {% rauser MrOwnership %}):

- Users can request sets for games with no achievements (it was actually in the end of 2019)
- Ticket filtering improvements.
- Allow users to hide site awards.
- New individual achievement creators stats page with a lot of interesting details.
- Global Leaderboard page with a lot of filtering options.
- Added "Latest Masters" tab on the game's page.
- Added option to reset progress, individually in achievement's page and the whole
set in the game's page - by {% rauser meleu %}
- Other bug fixes by {% rauser MrOwnership %}, {% rauser luchaos %},
{% rauser gde %}, {% rauser juherr %} and {% rauser meleu %}


## Community

- I great improvement in the community part happened after we published the
[RetroAchievements Manifesto](https://docs.retroachievements.org/RetroAchievements-Manifesto/).
Where we put clearly who we are, what we do and what we value. It also makes very clear
that disrespectful interactions in this community is not tolerated.

- [RANews](https://news.retroachievements.org/) started. By {% rauser meleu %} (website),
{% rauser StingX2 %} (gathering content), {% rauser televandalist %} (creating the
covers) and several contributions from many other community members.

- [RAPodcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIGdJGxrzmNYMaAGPsk2sIA) started.
By {% rauser Draco655 %}, {% rauser Shootzy %}, {% rauser Bendyhuman %} (now retired)
and {% rauser KingS1zzle %}.

- {% rauser Thoreau %} started his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCIDeKW0I32Bgnz8DWFSJxA) with valuable content for RA fans in the
brazilian/portuguese-speaking community. There are achievement creation tutorials,
interviews with brazilian achievement creators and more.

- {% rauser wilhitewarrior %} hosted the Devember event. It was a thunderous success,
closing/solving a big amount of tickets. It was so freaking cool that it deserved
a [dedicated page in this very edition of RANews](devember).

- {% rauser KingS1zzle %} proposed that community members with computer graphics
skills could volunteer to improve the imagery of the achievement sets. We created
a process for it in our discord server and now the overall quality of the game
icons and achievement badges is constantly being improved, as you can see in
the [Art Updates](art-updates) section of [EACH](../2020-12/art-updates). [RANEWS](../2020-11/art-updates). [ISSUE](../2020-10/art-updates). [BEING](../2020-09/art-updates). [RELEASED](../2020-08/art-updates).

- {% rauser KickMeElmo %} linked a ridiculous amount of MSU-1 ROMs for those who
enjoy it. And he also keeps a [big repository with many MSU-1 patches](https://keybase.pub/kickmeelmo/ROM%20patches/MSU-1/).

- {% rauser StingX2 %} started [The Unwanted](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=11073)
event, focused on playing and fixing underplayed sets. Which surely is helping
to improve the overall quality of the RetroAchievements project.

- {% rauser televandalist %}, besides creating sets, doing reviews, rescores and tons of
other RA-chores and having a burnout, also created a process where new achievement
creators, aka jr-devs, can [get a badge](http://retroachievements.org/game/3046)
when they meet the requirements needed to be a "full dev".


## Random Facts

- During 2020 we released over **800 new achievement sets**!!! This is mindblowing!
It's like more than two new achievement sets being released EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

- We reached the mark of 3 thousand achievement sets released, and the 3000th
set is [Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II (NES)](https://retroachievements.org/game/2083),
created by {% rauser hardt %}.

- About 40 new achievement creators, aka jr-devs, graduated.
