Phew! What a tough year!

![Sonic sweating](img/ssweat.png)


I kinda enjoy reading about past historical facts, but I'm not sure if feel the same
about experiencing one. Well, let's not focus on what is beyond our control and
instead do our best to stay alive during this pandemic thing.

If you're reading this, congratulations on surviving 2020! :trophy:

And please keep on it. I wish you all a great year and #StaySafe.

Now, let's check what to expect from this RANews issue.


## Quick Overview

What to expect from this issue.


### Editorial

Let's remember some cool things that the community made over the last year in this 2020 in review.



### The Devember Event

It was one of the cool thing that happened in the last year. But as it was so outstandingly cool,
it deserves a dedicated page for it. Just to show what the heroes of this community were able
to do.



### Play This Set

Community members talking about their favorite sets and why you should play them. Cool stuff!


### RAGuide

A nice guide for the Suikoden (PlayStation) game, made by {% rauser televandalist %}.

**ALERT!** The guides usually contain spoilers about the game.
