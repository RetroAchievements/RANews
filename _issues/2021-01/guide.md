## 2) Introduction

![Game Badge](https://retroachievements.org/Images/026467.png)

[Suikoden (Japanese: 幻想水滸伝 Hepburn: Gensō Suikoden)](http://retroachievements.org/game/11255) Suikoden , is a role-playing video game published by Konami as the first installment of the Suikoden series. Developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, it was released initially in 1995 for the PlayStation in Japan. A North American would release followed one year later, and a mainland European release came the following April. The game was also released for the Sega Saturn in 1998 only in Japan, and for Microsoft Windows in 1998 in Japan.

The game centers on the political struggles of the Scarlet Moon Empire. The player controls a Scarlet Moon Empire general's son who is destined to seek out 108 warriors (referred to as the 108 Stars of Destiny) in order to revolt against the corrupt sovereign state and bring peace to a war-torn land. The game is loosely based on the Chinese novel Shui Hu Zhuan (a.k.a. "Outlaws of the Marsh" and "The Water Margin"), and features a vast array of characters both controllable and not, with over ninety characters usable in combat and many more able to help or hinder the hero in a variety of ways.

## 4) Missable Achievements

### [Early Bird - Prosperity Crystal](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/79942)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/86069.png) 10 points  
*Obtain the Prosperity Crystal in Saraday*

Near the beginning of the game - When Teo and Tir arrive at the McDohl mansion, you must leave town, head west and make your way through Mt. Tigerwolf, then head north to Saraday. Talk to the man in the northeast house.

The safest way to go about this: After leaving the mansion, buy whatever equipment you can to raise your defense, and save at the inn. Head to the world map and repeatedly get into battles to raise your level. I usually save after every level up. It is also recommended to head south to Lenankamp and sharpen your weapon at the blacksmith. A good source of money at this point in the game is by playing Marco's cup game in Rockland, which is east of Gregminster. 

Point of no return - Going upstairs when arriving at the McDohl mansion for the first time.

### [Early Bird - Fortune Crystal](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/79941)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/86069.png) 10 points  
*Obtain the Fortune Crystal in Saraday*

Exactly the same as obtaining the Prosperity Crystal in Saraday, only do it with Ted. After arriving at the McDohl mansion, head upstairs to automatically trigger a scene with Ted, who will join your party. Then head back downstairs and follow the same steps as the Prosperity Crystal.

Point of no return - Going into your room after Ted joins.

### [Hero of Rockland](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/79939)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/86071.png) 3 points  
*Save the kids from Imperial Soldiers in Rockland*

Rockland - After capturing Varkas and Sydonia. In front of the mansion will be some imperial soldiers beating the shit out of some kid while another kid is crying. Stop them. 

Point of no return - Delivering the bandits to Grady.

### [Protecting Kids Through College](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/80188)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/86504.png) 10 points  
*Complete Chapman's Stockpile*

There are two armor shops you must visit before you're unable to: Gregminster (Early) and Village of the Elves.

Point of no return - Being banished from Gregminster and delivering the running water root to the Dwarf Elder.

### [Antiquarian](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/83404)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/90355.png) 25 points

*Store at least one of every antique in Rock's Vault*

Celadon Urns can only be obtained outside of Gregminister by fighting BonBons. Octopus Urns are also only obtained by fighting BonBons, but there is one in a chest at Mt. Tigerwolf, but you're screwed if you sell it after you're longer able to fight BonBons. I recommend getting both ASAP since there is an appraisal shop in Gregminister.

Point of no return - After getting past the gate south of Lenankamp. 

### [Treasure Hunter - Toran](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/80019)

*Catch Lotte's cat without Stallion in your party*

In Kaku after talking to Lotte in Rikon a couple times (she must ask you to bring her cat back to her). While having Stallion in your party will not trigger the achievement, the same cannot be said of the Holy Rune. It's not impossible to catch the cat without either, though. Figure it out.

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/86410.png) 5 points  
*You couldn't even cover Vincent's bill?*

As soon as the Dragon's Den arc starts, you will be turned away. When you head to Antei, a scene with Vincent and the innkeeper will trigger. Once Vincent leaves, you will be expected to pay his bill. If you have less than 200 bits (I think?), you will be forced to work it off in a hidden bonus scene.

Point of no return - Entering Antei with more than 200 bits (I think?)

### [Dragon Whisperer](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/80091)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/86411.png) 5 points

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/86420.png) 5 points  
*Recruit Max, Sancho, and Qlon*

Max and Sancho are missable here since they join together. Max wants to join the Liberation Army. You either reject him or allow him to join.

Point of no return - Rejecting his offer

### [The Experts](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/79949)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/86300.png) 10 points  
*Recruit Clive, Pesmerga, and Mace*

Mace is missable. You need to take all the other blacksmiths with you at castle lv 4, and there are few chances with at least four free party slots.

Point of no return - The last chance is right after you landed by boat on Shasarazade. Don't go near the entrance, turn around and leave.

### [The Strategists](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/80095)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/86427.png) 10 points  
*Recruit Mathiu, Leon, and Apple*

Leon is missable. You need to talk to him when you have the castle at lv 4, then talk to Mathiu, deliver Mathiu's letter, which won't work most of the time, since Mathiu participates often in major battles or other events.

Point of no return - After you started the mission to Shasarazade.

### [The Sixth General](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/80112)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/86474.png) 10 points
