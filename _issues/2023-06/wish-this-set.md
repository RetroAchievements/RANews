## World Driver Championship (Nintendo 64)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Console     | Genre                                                        |

Amid all the Gran Turismo lookalikes that tried to capture Polyphony's same lightning in a bottle, one that's rarely talked about and criminally overlooked is World Driver Championship, one of the only (if not THE only) attempt at a realistic racer exclusive to Nintendo hardware.

World Driver Championship (Or WDC as I'll call it from now on) has a fairly simple progression. You start as a newbie driver in the lower leagues with only two teams willing to give you a chance. You accept an offer, meet the team owner with a small line of dialogue, and get to racing. Competing in championships raises your ranking which unlocks more offers from better and faster teams. Again, it's all fairly simple and serves as nothing more than a basic backdrop to the racing itself, but it's all the small things that add a bit of spice here. Teams and owners have their own little biographies and personalities, and the feeling of progression as you get access to more and more capable machines is satisfying on a very base level.

However, it's the driving where the true merit of this game lies. Cars are weighty and you can feel that weight shift and use it to your advantage; they feel surprisingly real and rewarding to drive, while still being controllable enough that a 9-year-old me got the handle on it after some practice. Though none of the cars are licensed, they have clear likenesses to real world cars with handling incredibly distinct and quirks that are accurate to their actual counterparts. The Stallion (Ford Mustang) is a heavy brute, weighty as it powerslides into every corner while firing pistols into the air and screaming "MURICA!", but able to use that weight to bully opposing drivers. The 512 Evo (Porsche 911) was nimble and planted under accel, but packing a gargantuan dumpy that liked to get twitchy when hard on the brakes. The Manta (Corvette) was well rounded and no-nonsense, but if you got too frisky with the gas, it'd bite at you in a fit of boomer rage. And any cars from EXR (TVR) were disgustingly fast, but also hate-fueled axe murderers that could snap at any moment with no warning and leave you in a twisted plexiglass coffin wrapped around a tree.

One couldn't be blamed for thinking on first glance that WDC was just trying to cash in on the console racing sim trend on a system with almost no competition in the subgenre, with the game's generic name and first impression, but I can assure you, that couldn't be farther from the truth. This game stands up well enough on its own thanks to all the love and effort poured into the way it drives and is easily worth a test drive, and hopefully a full set sometime down the line.

## Blue Submarine No. 6: Saigetsu Fumahito - Time and Tide (Dreamcast)

Blue Submarine No. 6 on the Dreamcast is a prequel game to the OVA series of the same name. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth that got flooded by a mad scientist, it has that very distinct 2000's anime vibe. Of course you are a brooding loner with a shady past but uniquely talented, that what everyone was at the time! You play as a Scavenger, a sort of mercenary that explore the ocean trying to find various items for your clients. Aboard your own mini submarine it's overall a very relaxing game, featuring lots of chill exploration with a bit of combat occasionally and customization options for your vehicle.

One thing to note is that the game is originally a Japan only title that got translated. While this is nowadays a fairly common thing, it has numerous points where the dialogue was only voice acted during gameplay, with no text appearing on screen. To compensate, the people responsible for this chose to re-dub it in English above the original voices! It can be jarring at times, but when a team go to such lengths for a free translation I can't help but just admire the dedication.

## Lumines (PlayStation Portable)

In 2004, the PSP launched in Japan, with one of the titles released with it being Lumines: Puzzle Fusion. It worked great as a launch title for the platform: it was perfect for handhelds, it had a similar aesthetic to the system itself, and, importantly, gained value from a feature Nintendo didn't offer at the time: a headphone jack.

Lumines is a falling block puzzle game oriented heavily around music. Blocks of smaller blocks fall onto the screen and you fill areas with the same color to clear them. But the gameplay is enhanced by the game's music: as you progress, you unlock new songs that come with their own "skins" for the blocks and interface. Designed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who also made [Rez](https://retroachievements.org/game/3419) and [Space Channel 5](https://retroachievements.org/game/3484), the soundtrack falls in line with that of the former game, but it's more eclectic, incorporating styles that range from dance-oriented to jazzy to calming. Even if you don't normally like falling block games, give it a try, and you might just stay for the vibes.

Infinite Space is an unusual spacefaring RPG on the Nintendo DS, the product of a collaboration between PlatinumGames and Nude Maker, a somewhat dubiously-named studio staffed by former [Human Entertainment](https://retroachievements.org/game/7031) employees. At its core, Infinite Space is mostly about engaging in ship-to-ship combat in space, something you don't see terribly often in an RPG. The main thing that stands out about Infinite Space is the surprising amount of customization the game offers for your ship, allowing you to channel your inner gearhead and try to cram as many modules into your ship's available space as possible, or even save up the money to buy multiple ships and run a whole fleet! You can also choose the staff on your ships, many of who are recruited through special events in an almost [Suikoden](https://retroachievements.org/game/11255)-like manner.

Another unique feature is the surprisingly flexible storyline. There's numerous points in the story where things can go surprisingly differently depending on how you choose to handle something. They manage to make it feel like lives hang in the balance with your decisions, which is good because they sometimes do! All in all, Infinite Space is a fascinating hidden gem of the DS's library that more people need to check out, and the hidden character recruitment, different event outcomes and complex ship customization should provide a rich canvas for a prospective Developer to produce an interesting achievement set.

## Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V Tag Force Special (PlayStation Portable)

Because of the lame state of the franchise currently, at least in games, the best way to enjoy Yugioh is playing the old games be the World Championship series for [GBA](https://retroachievements.org/game/5114)/[DS](https://retroachievements.org/game/15737), the Legacy of Duelist game for PC (Steam)/XboxOne/PS4, some [random games](https://retroachievements.org/game/8018) for GBA, PS1, PS2, DS and other platforms, or the Tag Force series for PSP, and since we are talking about Tag Force, let's go talk a little about Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V Tag Force Special (or TF7) which probably is the Yugioh game i most played until now.

TF7 was released only on Japan (Konami really don't know how to handle their IPs _looks at Castlevania_), but a group of fans translated most of the game to English so it's easy to play (there are PT-BR and Spanish translations too) and the game follows the same format of choosing one of a few partners from each anime season (Classic, GX, 5D's, Zexal and Arc-V), playing against iconic characters in single duel, tag duel, or partner duel until you fill a heart, win a story event duel, and after 4 times you finish his/her story and win a iconic card like Blue-eyes White Dragon when playing with Kaiba as a partner.

While it's the biggest Tag Force game with 5 whole generations to play and cards released up to the start of Arc-V (there's even a few pendulum cards in the game so you can use the most broken mechanic ever made in this franchise), the worst problem of this game is your partner AI which is too dumb to play tag duels and the enemy is easy to beat even if you don't use meta decks at this time like Dragon Rulers, Six Samurai, Nekroz, Stellarknights or Shadoll... But, that's only the normal game because the AI for the special Dark Tournaments (unlocked after beating your first story mode) are really good, and you will probably suffer with them a lot since they will use the best decks to completely defeat you.

Dokapon Kingdom sets out to answer one, key question: who is the best at RPGs? The "friendship-destroying" party game probably deserves a multi set, but the game can still be solo'd, sending you on a weird, RPG campaign through a fantasy world that looks suspiciously like the real one. There, you fight to control towns, maximize your market value, and curry the king's favour by winning quests, be it "by the book" or by robbing your fellow players the moment they do the hard work. Besides campaign mode, the game also has a timed freeplay mode, which relies on your knowledge of the game to avoid teleporting straight into a dragon's mouth. Is it cruel? Yes. Is it random and unfair? Also yes. But a good set of achievements could show all the things the game has to offer, but that you never had a chance to enjoy, because your stupid friends kept conquering all your towns with demonic powers. And once you know those secrets, you can turn it around on them the next time you play! And isn't that what friendship is really about?

If there was any set I'm dying for, it has to be a console game from the RPG Maker series. There were three released in English: RPG Maker (PS), RPG Maker II (PS2), and RPG Maker 3 (PS2). For those who are skeptical about making games using a controller, the one on PS supports the PlayStation Mouse and the others on PS2 support a USB keyboard.

On their own, each entry comes with a sample game that is already ripe for an achievement set, though the meat and potatoes come from the tools the game provides. They're deep yet easy to learn, and makes creating turn-based RPGs and visual novels an engaging process. This opens up opportunities not only for RA users to make their own games that could be developed sets for, but also for the vast amount of RPG Maker games that were published on the internet across the two decades these games had existed!

With potential this vast for countless user-made games, please wish this set!

Hot Pixel went under the radar a little. It was essentially [WarioWare](https://retroachievements.org/game/802) for the PSP but with pixels and edgier humour.

The game has 10 different levels and a difficulty option, and much like WarioWare, you have 4 lives to complete minigames up until you reach the boss minigame; once you beat the boss, you'll beat the level, and you can replay it later to go for a high score. You can also replay any minigames you've previously found and go for a high score in those! (Again, much like WarioWare)

The game also featured a website where you could download more minigames from, though it has unfortunately been shut down.

I think this game would be perfect for achievements and leaderboards! And perhaps even a subset for the downloadable games.

My wish for a set that is long overdue and hasn't been worked on yet is Sonic Chronicles for the Nintendo DS. This Sonic game is unique for the fact it's the only turn-based RPG for Sonic the Hedgehog. Seeing as this community's first game was Sonic the Hedgehog, it's only fitting that we make the set for his only RPG game.

Sonic Chronicles has a unique Chao system to mess around with, which I would love to actually learn and collect for, seeing as a kid I never thought much of it. The game is surprisingly packed with content to find for completionists, such as Chao eggs and sidequests.

Now for the actual set, the game follows a story with a point of no return, so it's effectively divided in half. Each half has enough value of content so it's not purely story achievements. The game also lets you choose your own dialogue for some events, which could lead to some new achievements to earn. The game could also have boss challenges for your party, such as "using only these 4 members" or some neat references to other Sonic games such as [Heroes](https://retroachievements.org/game/19366).

Overall, this set has been on my mind since I joined in October of 2021, and I along with many others would love to see a set finally release for this unique Sonic game.

I think Pokemon Cramorant Edition, the brand new [Yellow](https://retroachievements.org/game/723) romhack that replaces Pikachu with Cramorant, requires a set for a few key reasons. The first and perhaps biggest reason is the inclusion of the all-star Pokemon from gen 8 who spits up fish with the strength and speed of an Olympian hammer throw, Cramorant. Cramorant is a powerful beast hitherto now unseen in a solo adventure. Commemoration of such an advancement in bird buddy adventure romhacks is absolutely necessary.

The second reason is that there are other things changed than just the addition of a best friend Cramorant. There are 2 other Pokemon added to the game. While not explicitly stated on the romhacking page, my suspicion is that these 2 would be Arrokuda and Barraskewda just on the principle that Cramorant enjoys eating these particular beasts. There are also new battles, a greater variety of Pokemon seen in trainer battles, a wealth of new invisible hidden items (which provides an opportunity for the set dev to do something really funny and mean if they so wish), an easier Safari Zone, and general small gameplay changes and quality of life improvements.

Truly who are we to stand in front of Pokemon Cramorant Edition and deny it passage into the vast array of RetroAchievements-supported Pokemon romhacks? Cramorant deserves his seat on the council of hacks. Whoever does us the favor of creating this set does it with glory.
