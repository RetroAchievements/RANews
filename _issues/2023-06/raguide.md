# Overview

This guide will be about all the achievements for the game, and will also help you into achieving the General rank, the highest rank in the game. It is possible to go for all of the achievements in 1 playthrough (minus 1 achievement) by using saves, and it is suggested to do so, as many achievements are easily missable due to some places or options being no longer available when getting far enough through the story, or some achievements related to certain events that you wouldn't want to do them if pursuing the General rank.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105852.png) [Sweet Smell of Success (50)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96039)   
Complete Act III with the General rank

Generally, to increase your rank the following is required:
- Answer all the questions correctly and in the intended way by the game;
- Finish all the shooting segments by taking the fewest amount of damage and missing the fewest amount of shots;
- Do not die and select continue. Reloading a save circumvents this penalty;
- Don't do any interactions that are considered bad, creepy, or that make you look incompetent. It is suggested to reload a prior save to these events if you do them;
- Using too many options that lead to nowhere will cause your rank to drop all the way to Captain. Either Spamming the same option, moving to places not required, or even using every option once, unless they they are intended to progress. It is suggested to follow a route that has the minimum amount of options used to get through the game.

There are certain factors to keep in mind:
- The amount of saves done does not matter;
- Time spent in total to finish the game is not taken into account;
- Score at the Shooting Range on any difficulty doesn't have any impact;
- Most of the extra dialog or events that are not negative do not contribute for ranking.

While doing the secondary events is not necessary, the game requires some events to be done to be able to get the General rank. Even just doing these events and nothing else can award you the rank, as long as the normal requirements for increasing the rank are followed.

- [Act 1 - Calling Loveline three times](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96001)    
- [Act 1 - Visiting the Fortune Teller](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95782)    
- [Act 1 - Eating Neo Kobe Pizza](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95983)    
- [Act 2 - Eating Ramen](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95783)   
- [Act 2 - Visiting the Fortune Teller in Act 2](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/189424)    

It is possible to go for all the other events while going for the rank. However, some events will be bad enough to drop your rank, even getting just one of them. All of these events will be marked to identify which is which. For achievements about bad events, it is suggested to make a save before doing them, so to not jeopardize your run. Story related achievements won't have a need to be marked, as you'd have to do them anyway.

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8af2f203-6c6c-4a9f-98d3-27ba4f21befb) NEUTRAL - Nothing is affected

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/a9e2e43b-d265-4dbf-9e32-cfec89acdf72) NEGATIVE - Will drop your rank

![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8b81a53e-8652-4a6b-aeaa-75c9cdf0c57c) IMPORTANT - Necessary for General rank

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105858.png) [Saving the Day (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96037)   
Complete the game with less than 3 saves

It is not suggested to go for this achievement on the first playthrough, as you'd have to work with just 2 saves throughout the game, while trying to do everything. It is better to go for this when done with everything else, so to not having to be preoccupied about rank, or use this opportunity to clean up anything missed.

# Act 1: Snatch

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105565.png) [Sowing the Seeds](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95976)   
Watch the entire intro

Enjoy the intro in it's entirety.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105581.png) [A Random Topic (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95977) ![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8af2f203-6c6c-4a9f-98d3-27ba4f21befb)    
Find out about Random Hajile from the Chief

When meeting the Chief for the first time, you'll be able to `ASK` him about any topics. If you pick `ABOUT JUNKER AUTHORITY` 3 times, you'll get `ABOUT BOUNTY HUNTER`S as an option. Choosing this, the name Random Hajile will be mentioned in the dialog.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105863.png) [The Big Boss (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96043) ![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8af2f203-6c6c-4a9f-98d3-27ba4f21befb)    
Use Jordan to look up Snatcher's creator

You can do this as early as asking Mika `HOW TO USE` in the Computer Room while she's showing you around.

While in the Computer Room, pick `USE JORDAN`. Write the name `KOJIMA` in the I.D. file search to find his file.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/178337.png) [It's the Only Way to Be Sure! (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/158604) ![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/a9e2e43b-d265-4dbf-9e32-cfec89acdf72)   
Shoot only the civilians and no snatchers without missing any shots while Mika looks on in horror

While Mika is showing you around Junker after meeting the Chief, you can go into the shooting range and choose `PRACTICE`. Instead of shooting Snatchers as you should, shoot all of the civilians instead, without missing a shot.

You won't be able to save just yet, so you have to reset your game, so to not continue with the penalty and for doing the other achievement.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105690.png) [Snatcher Heart (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95984) ![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8af2f203-6c6c-4a9f-98d3-27ba4f21befb)    
Get a perfect score without missing any shots at the shooting range while Mika is showing you around

Same as `It's the Only Way to Be Sure!`, but instead do it as you are supposed to. Shoot all of the Snatchers without missing a shot. And don't shoot any civilians this time!

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105809.png) [Sharpshooter (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96019) ![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8af2f203-6c6c-4a9f-98d3-27ba4f21befb)    
Get a perfect score without missing any shots at the shooting range on the introductory difficulty

This can be earned at the same time as `Snatcher Heart`, due to having basically the same requirement.

Shoot all Snatchers, no civilians harmed, no shot missed.

For the rest of the achievements related to the shooting range, you'll have to wait for Act II.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105566.png) [From Junkie to Junker (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95764)    
Obtain your Junker ID and Blaster

After getting the Junker I.D. from the chief and the Blaster from Harry, you'll also get this achievement.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105567.png) [Head of the Junkers (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95765)    
Meet up with Gibson in the Abandoned Factory

Proceeding through the Abandoned Factory, you'll inevitably find him.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105569.png) [Does This Mean I'm Promoted? (4)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95766)    
Abandoned Factory - Fully investigate the crime scene

`INVESTIGATE` and `LOOK` anything you can. Remember that you need to keep the clues found as evidence by using `LOOK` and `INVESTIGATE` on them.

***

Abandoned Factory - Kill all the insectors without missing or taking damage

Just like at the shooting range, but now you need to be fast enough so that they won't be able to shoot you.

Exhaust all options in your new apartment

Whenever you get into Gillian's Apartment in Act 1, exhaust every single option in his apartment, bathroom included. The achievement should appear when you exhausted everything.

I wouldn't suggest doing this while going for General, since you'll be repeating options too many times here.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105769.png) [Bugging the Girl of My Dreams (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96006) ![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8af2f203-6c6c-4a9f-98d3-27ba4f21befb)     
Bug Jamie and learn about her dreams

You can find Jamie either ready to go out or in bed when calling for her in Act 1. If you find her in bed, you can `ASK` her about her `DREAMS` and `NEGLIGEE`.

Saving and reloading to find her in bed is suggested, so to not call her too many times.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105962.png) [She's as Green as They Come (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96107) ![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8af2f203-6c6c-4a9f-98d3-27ba4f21befb)    
Have Mika eavesdropon your phone call with Jamie

You can do this whenever you want in act 1. The earliest this can be done is right when you discover Jamie's number.

You just need to call Jamie when you're in front of Mika.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105588.png) [The Short Answer (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95769) ![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8b81a53e-8652-4a6b-aeaa-75c9cdf0c57c)    
Give the correct password to Napoleon, AFTER taking the steps to obtain it

Basically, do as you're supposed to do it.


- Find the videophone number. You'll find it by looking and investigate the brandy bottle Harry is drinking;

- Look up Napoleon on the Jordan to find the profile about the historical figure Napoleon;

- After investigating the detective room, talk to Mika first about Buffalo Restaurant, then about Napoleon, so that she'll suggest to find him.


When these steps are done, call him and he'll ask to complete one of the two senteces he can give. The answers can be found in the Jordan I.D. file of Napoleon.


If he's saying "The 100-year", the answer is `REIGN`.

If he's saying "The Revolution", the answer is `IS ENDED`.

Discover the locations of Outer Heaven and Plato's Cavern

You can find out from Napoleon about Outer Heaven's location when meeting him in Alton Plaza.
For Plato's Cavern location, you need to call their videophone number, which can be found by looking for their ad on the big sign in Alton Plaza.

***

Spot the Chief in Alton Plaza

While in Alton Plaza, `LOOK` at the `AREA` until Jamie and the Chief are seen together.

Another achievement is related to this. If you don't do this and also call Jamie and `TALK` to her about her being in Alton Plaza, you won't be able to do the other.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105597.png) [A Seed Without Soil (4)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95781) ![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8af2f203-6c6c-4a9f-98d3-27ba4f21befb)    
Try to pick up women in Alton Plaza until options are exhausted  

`LOOK` at the `AREA` in Alton Plaza until Gillian wants to pick up women. It can take you somewhere like 30 times to get this.
A `PICK UP WOMEN` option will appear. Select this option 4 times to exhaust it.

I also don't suggest going for this when going for General. Picking up women does not penalize you like you think it would, but it does take too many times using that one option to get this.

***

Call the LoveLine until they go out of business.

If you `LOOK` at the `NEARBY PEOPLE`, you'll be handed a tissue with a videophone number for the Loveline. Call the given number 3 times until a discussion about censorship starts.

***

Visit the Fortune Teller

`LOOK` at the `NEARBY CROWD` until Metal Gear sees the Fortune Teller. `LOOK` and `INVESTIGATE` the `FORTUNE TELLER`, then `GET FORTUNE TOLD` to get a cutscene.

***

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105590.png) [Trust Me, I'm A Junker (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95978) ![](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8b81a53e-8652-4a6b-aeaa-75c9cdf0c57c)    
Gain entry into Gibson's home without getting any questions wrong

Show her your Junker I.D. when requested, then answer her questions. 
The answers, just like with Napoleon, need to be found in the I.D. files on the Jordan of the corresponding characters.

About Gibson's Age, the answer is `55`.

About Katrina, the answers are `BIRTHMARK`, `HEART-SHAPED` (`HEART` is also accepted), `INNER THIGH` (`THIGH` is also accepted).

Get forced to leave Gibson's house

This can be done right when you gain access to the house.
Use the option `DO SOMETHINGS` accompanied by `PERSUADE` for a few times and she'll kick you out of the house.

Promise to take Katrina shopping

Ask Katrina about herself. Then move into another place (like Alton Plaza), come back and ask her again for a few times until she'll ask Gillian to go shopping.

I suggest to also save before doing this just in case, as the game can penalize you even when going to places repeatedly. Especially when not required.

Try the Neo Kobe Pizza outside of Plato's Cavern

Outside of Plato's Cavern, choose the `SMELL` option. `INVESTIGATE` the `FOOD STAND` 2 times and `SMELL` again until you get the `EAT NEO KOBE PIZZA` option.

While inside Plato's Cavern, pick `INVESTIGATE` and then `INSIDE STORE` for at least 6 times and you should find a VHS.

Inside Outer Heaven, you'll notice some familiar faces by looking at the costumers. `LOOK` at each one of the `CUSTOMERS`, to identify each one of them.

I hope you know your Konami characters!

Get Isabella's phone number then celebrate with all the food and drinks you can handle

During the dancer's interrogation, you can `ASK` for her videophone number. After 6 times she'll give it to you.

After doing so, finish the questioning, and `ORDER FOOD` or `DRINKS` until the game doesn't let you order anymore.

Get a perfect score without missing any shots at the shooting range on the intermediate difficulty

Just at the start of Act II, you can go straight to the shooting range. Selecting `PRACTICE` will immedaitely give you access to the intermediate difficulty.

It's a faster version of the introductory level, but it should take you just a few tries to do this.

Get a perfect score without missing any shots at the shooting range on the highest difficulty

You need to get at least 3 perfect score in intermediate to get to the highest difficulty. Next time you choose `PRACTICE`, a dialog will start confirming the change in difficulty.

On the highest difficulty, some civilians will be Snatchers disguised. They can be recognized only within a short time frame where they show their green eyes. The only tip that i can give here is to pay attention to the red bar on the left. It keeps track of how many Snatchers appeared. You can have an idea if there is a Snatcher among the civilians by watching if the bar increases.

I highly suggest to save after you get this difficulty. This is because if you make a bad enough score, the game can actually decrease the difficulty, requiring doing perfect scores in intermediate again.

Do not get any of Metal's questions wrong at the beginning of Act III

Metal Gear will ask you questions to recapitulate about everything you've learned about the Snatchers.
Answer all of them correctly.

The answers, in order, are:

 1. `ULTRAVIOLET RAYS`

 2. `UNDERPASS`

 3. `SNEEZE`

 4. `SNOW-9`

 5. `MOSCOW`

Act III - Survive the Super Insector battle

Contrary to all the other fights, this one is the only exception to the rule about perfecting all the fights. Unlike the normal Insectoids, these ones will jump in one place to another, and they also shoot faster. It'll be very difficult to not get damaged, so just try to go through this fight without getting damaged too much or missing too many shots.

Kill all the snatchers in the church without missing or taking damage

This is easier than the Super Insectoids just because the Snatchers appear one by one. Only shoot them in the head, as shooting anywhere else won't kill them.

After the Snatchers fight, shoot at the dark silhouette.
Instead of being penalizing, this will just soft reset your game. Beware about this one especially when going for low saves run.

You should get this, and the other rank related achievements, when Mika salutes you.

In the end, what you need here is to have a complete route that has the fewest required actions to get through the game, and the events that are necessary to do. As long as you don't make too many interactions that don't contribute to progression, and avoid the negative events, you should be fine.
