## How to Contribute with RANews

If you have an idea for an article to be published in the RANews, please go to the {% rauser RAdmin %} profile page and send us a message.

Keep in mind that the article must be written in markdown format. If you don’t know it, you can learn it in 10 minutes following this online tutorial here: <https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/> (it’s pretty similar to what you may be already using on discord).
