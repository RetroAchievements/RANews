## Spot the Difference

It's a wonderful day in Chrono Trigger and many people visit the Lenne Square to buy items on the market and enjoying the environment. It seems like the timetraveling affected things in the future and so there are 10 differences in the lower image. Can you find them all?

Note: The first user who finds all 10 differences and sends proof to SporyTike via Site DM or Discord will be listed in the next issue as the winner. Additionally a random selected user which submitted the solution until the end of the month will be chosen to select the game of the next picture.
