## Intro

What's going on in the achievement creation scene.

## DevQuests

In July we started the DevQuest #7.

If you want more info about all DevQuests, we centralize information about them [in this forum topic](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=13060).


### QUEST #007: Most Wanted

| Game | Console | Genre | 
|------|---------|-------| 
| <a class="gameicon-link" href="https://retroachievements.org/game/17758" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img class="gameicon" src="https://retroachievements.org/Images/046249.png" alt="Most Wanted [DevQuest]"> <span>Most Wanted [DevQuest]</span></a> | Events | Developer Event |

- **Goal:** Develop a set for one of the most requested sets on the site that appears in the [Most Wanted Games](set-requests) segment of RANews. Once you claim it, you're good even if it falls off the list.
- **Point of Contact:** {% rauser StingX2 %}
- **Requirements:**
    1. You must have an open claim as you will need to claim your set
    2. Must be a full set, not just progression. Badges will be denied to those who make incomplete sets.
    3. If you already have one claimed you must be under 50% progress for it to count
    4. **Must run it by StingX2 so he can mark you off as claiming it.** "I'm not a mind reader!"
