## Introduction

Dragon Force was one of the most highly rated games on Saturn. It is a strategy-RPG where you select a kingdom and play through a non-linear, unique campaign to unite the other seven monarchs of Legendra and form the Dragon Force. Only then can the dark god Madruk, who is threatening all of mankind, be challenged and defeated. The game features both campaign-level map conquest as you move armies between strategic locations including castles, towns, shrines and towers as well as real time battles opposing forces lead by generals command up to 100 troops each. The game boasts one of the best sound tracks in retro gaming history with almost all of the music being extremely well made.


## Set Design

Due to the non-linear design of the game, there is significant variety between play throughs and even more variety between selected kingdoms. In order to provide exposure to the game's full content, it was determined that play throughs of each kingdom, focusing on their unique aspects would be the most appropriate course of action. As such, each kingdom has over 20 kingdom-specific achievements that can only be unlocked during its specific play through and an additional 39 achievements that can be earned while playing as any kingdom.

Each kingdom offers a unique experience and potential for a different approach to the conquest portion of the game. As such, the set was designed to maximize players' exposure to the aspects that differentiate each kingdom. Kingdom-specific achievements are a mix of progression and challenge achievements.


## Compatibility

The achievements require the following linked hash:

## Achievements

When playing through the set, focus only on the achievements available to whichever kingdom you selected as well as the achievements marked [Any]. Nearly all of the missable achievements are quite straight forward to set up if following a general outline. A good practice for each kingdom is to recruit Vlad at the earliest opportunity and follow this guide's recommendations for fulfilling the kingdom-specific Zanon storylines. Additionally, whenever you intend to fight an opposing monarch, ensure your monarch is part of the invading force. These two simple rules of thumb will cover the vast majority of missable achievements.

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270425.png) **[Highland] Lead By Example** (3 points)

_Win a duel with Wein_

During battle, after all troops are killed the surviving generals will be given an option to duel each other. With Wein as your general, win a duel.

***

_Resolve the misunderstanding and recruit the rebel thief Hilga_

Hilga starts on the town just northwest of Highland castle. Deploy a force to defeat her in battle and capture her. If she retreats while her health is not low enough, she will not be captured and instead run. If this happens, reengage her and try again. After she is captured, she will automatically join your force at the next domestic session.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/272548.png) **[Highland] Purse Snatcher** (2 points)

_Subdue Hikkis and recruit him_

Hikkis start off in Galfiel castle which is immediately west of Highland castle. Defeat and capture him in battle and during a domestic session, grant him audience as a captive and he will join your force.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270431.png) **[Highland] The Flash Knights** (5 points)

_Enlist the service of the Flash Knights, Ogredd and Lone_

The Flash Knights are guarding the outskirts of Travan castle. Defeat Ogredd and Lone in battle to capture them and they will join during the next domestic session. Note, in order to get the missable achievement [Highland] A Knife in Borgon's Back[m], redirect the army that defeated Ogredd and Lone during their victory animation (pause if needed) back to one of your castles. If you fail to do this, retreat from the fight against Borgon's forces before entering into battle with any of them. You will need to wait for the next domestic session for Ogredd and Lone to join for that missable achievement.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270413.png) **[Highland] A Knife in Borgon's Back [m]** (10 points)

_Defeat Borgon and his two henchmen, Diablo and Faliel, in a single encounter with Ogredd and Lone in your party. Ogredd and Lone must each win at least one battle, lose none and Ogredd must be the one to kill Borgon on the battlefield_

After you have recruited Ogredd and Lone, deploy them and anyone else you wish, to attack Travan castle. During the battle Borgon, Diablo and Faliel must all be part of the enemy force and will be only unless you previously fought and killed some of them. I recommend using Lone to defeat the weakest enemy general and only use Ogredd to fight Borgon himself.  Utilize other generals such as Wein and Rudger to defeat any other enemy generals.  Borgon has low health and will not retreat, so Ogredd should not have a problem defeating him.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270416.png) **[Highland] An Old Friend [m]** (5 points)

_Win the support of the Palemoon kingdom without fighting Teiris_

The easiest way to get this achievement is to have Wein engage any Palemoon general in battle. Instead of fighting, the Palemoon empire will join forces with Highland. Another method is waiting for the next domestic session after encountering at least one Palemoon general with any of your generals, but do not fight Teiris herself. At the next domestic session, Palemoon will join Highland. The only way to miss this achievement is to fully capture Teiris during the same week in which you initially encounter any Palemoon general. It is very unlikely you would do this without deliberately attempting it as it would be quite challenging and heavily luck dependent.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270421.png) **[Highland] Gaining Momentum** (10 points)

_Annex three kingdoms as Highland and gain the support of their monarchs_

Required progression - Once three opposing monarchs have joined your force either voluntarily as likely with Palemoon or after capturing them and waiting until they join at the next domestic session, this achievement will unlock.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270428.png) **[Highland] Mystery at the Shadow Tower** (5 points)

_Visit the Shadow Tower and receive news of Scythe and Gaul's disappearance_

Required progression - After a progress related domestic event where your advisor discusses the Shadow Tower, visit it with Wein. It is located north of the large lake which is northwest of Topaz castle. During the Shadow Tower event, you will meet Ramda and upon exiting the tower learn of Scythe and Gaul's disappearance automatically.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270418.png) **[Highland] Clash of the Swords [m]** (10 points)

_Resist Goldark's ambush and defeat him_

When you are nearly finished gathering the other monarchs, with the exception of Goldark, he will disappear at some point and then subsequent reappear and immediately enter battle with Wein. This achievement requires Wein to defeat Goldark during that ambush and not retreat from the battle. In order to ensure you are fully prepared always keep Wein's troop count maxed as the timing of Goldark's ambush cannot be precisely predicted after he disappears.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271066.png) **[Highland] Damsel in Distress [m]** (10 points)

_Rescue Teiris from Ryskim with Zanon's help_

To get this event, you must have recruited Vlad and defeated Ryskim with him after Ryskim's first appearance. Additionally, you must have encountered Zanon and gotten at least one domestic event discussing him - that will happen immediately after Wein's first encounter with Zanon (retreating is fine). Do not fully complete Zanon's storyline before getting this achievement as he will disappear and Ryskim will not reappear and kidnap Teiris. When Ryskim does kidnap Teiris, simply engage and defeat him.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270433.png) **[Highland] To Seal the Dark Sword** (10 points)

_Witness Zanon kill himself to seal the dark sword Eclisis_

This event is the finale of Zanon's storyline in the Highland campaign. It will trigger after several iterations of field encounters with Zanon and domestic events. The Zanon storyline requires an engagement with Wein to begin and then will subsequently alternate between domestic events and additional encounters. Some other progression events are required to progress the Zanon storyline, so be patient as it unfolds. It can be accomplished as late in the game as collecting the sacred weapons from the shrines.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270422.png) **[Highland] High Command** (25 points)

_Unite all members of the Dragon Force under Wein's command_

Required progression - This will trigger once Goldark joins the Dragon Force during the sacred weapon collecting timeframe of the campaign.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271143.png) **[Highland] Sword of Swords** (5 points)

_Equip Wein with the legendary Star Dragon Sword_

Required progression - After Katmando has begun to move and Wein and Goldark recover the Stargem sword from the Northern Shrine, Ramda will attack Katmando. Following the battle Ramda will transform the Stargem sword into the Star Dragon Sword. If Wein is already equipped with the Stargem sword, the achievement will unlock at that point. If not, equip him with it during the next domestic session.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271144.png) **[Highland] Broken Machine** (10 points)

_Destroy Katmando after receiving the Dragon Power from Miral and equipping the Star Dragon Sword_

Required progression - Wein will receive the Dragon Power from Miral after visiting the Northern Shrine with Goldark. Wein must have the Star Dragon Sword equipped in order to damage Katmando.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270432.png) **[Highland] The Kindness of the Heavens** (25 points)

_Defeat Madruk in his final form with Wein and return peace to Legendra_

Required progression - Use soldier, monk, samurai or dragon troops against Madruk for best results. This achievement will unlock upon completion of the game as Highland.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270430.png) **[Highland] Thanks For Nothing [m]** (1 point)

_Present an award to Rudger, Galam, Nina or Link without them having won a battle_

Simply award one of the aforementioned generals that has not yet won a battle during a domestic session. This is only missable if all of them have won a battle before having been presented an award.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270424.png) **[Highland] Highland's Round Table** (10 points)

_Deploy an army consisting of Wein, Rudger, Galam, Nina and Link and engage another army. Each of them must win at least one battle and lose none_

The most difficult part of this achievement is finding an enemy force with at least five generals. Typically large groups of generals can be found guarding castles or conducting offensive attacks in the region between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor. When you are ready for this achievement, deploy the required army with max troops around this area and look for either a deployed army or castle with at five or more generals. Ensure each of your generals wins at least once and does not retreat or get defeated in any battles during the engagement.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270429.png) **[Highland] Strong Supporting Cast** (10 points)

_Win 20 battles between Rudger, Galam, Nina and Link_

When the total number of battle wins accumulated between the four aforementioned generals, this achievement will unlock.

***

_With an army of only Wein, Teiris and Junon, engage and enemy force of at least two generals. Win the battles only using Wein_

Once Palemoon and Tristan have been annexed, deploy an army of only Wein, Teiris and Junon and fight an enemy force of two or more generals. Wein must single handedly win all battles.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270420.png) **[Highland] Field Marshal** (5 points)

_Have Wein command 100 troops at once_

Target an enemy force with an inferior troop count.  Look for enemy forces of four generals in the area between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor. It is recommended to first annex Bozack and then Highland during the campaign to quickly recruit Wein with enough time to prepare for this achievement while enemy forces still possess large numbers of generals.

_Win three battles with each of Izumo's four main generals, Zagat, Jackal, Shione and Mistal, but do not let any have more than one win more than any other at any time_

The goal of this achievement is to get all four generals to three wins, but never letting one get too far ahead of the others.  The way to do this is to ensure all generals get one win before any of them get a second win.  Then ensure they all get to two without anyone getting to three first. Lastly, get to three wins with each of them. Losses are not a factor in this achievement so retreat from battle if necessary to prevent an unwanted win. This achievement will be missed if any of the four main generals has more than a 1 win lead at any time prior to unlocking.

Any general that can use the Assassin Star skill or looks like a ninja such as Hayate, Shirox, Shione or any of the generic ninja generals will work for this achievement. A good place to find an enemy force of at least 4 generals is in the area between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor kingdoms.

The achievement will lock as soon as Mikhal is able to command 100 samurai after presenting the award, so stay at 90 or less until this achievement is unlocked.

The easiest way to unlock this achievement is have Uryll able to command 100 of any type of troop, but enter a battle with none recruited. Troops don't need to die first in the battle, only be brought into it via the Resurrect skill. She also needs to have 8 MP as her Resurrect skill will need to be used four times as it will bring 25 additional troops each time it is used. Once a troop is resurrected it's fine for it to die. If you have less than 100 total troops or begin the battle with some troops, make sure you are missing at least 25 before you use Resurrect in order to maximize the number of resurrected troops with each cast.

_With an army of only Reinhart and Uryll, engage and defeat an enemy force of at least four generals. Reinhart must fight only once and win and Uryll must win all other battles_

Due to her strong Resurrect skill and her access to the Ensnare skill, as long as she has a decent amount of MP, Uryll is arguably the strongest general in the game. Make sure that she and Reinhart have high troop counts and then find an encounter with at least four enemy generals. The best place for this tends to be in the area between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor. Make sure Reinhart only wins one of the battles and Uryll wins all others.

_Occupy five castles by the end of the first week, not including Magicka castle_

This achievement is only possible during the first week of the campaign. Topaz begins with only five generals and when the week ends, each one of them needs to be occupying a different castle. This method for this is variable as the opposing kingdoms do not always behave the same way. You will have to determine which forces you can quickly overwhelm to seize castles and may have to abandon castles if they cannot be defended. The castle that you can rebuild to the south of Topaz called Magicka castle does not count toward this achievement.

Additionally, you must have encountered Zanon and gotten at least one domestic event discussing him - that will happen immediately after Leon's first encounter with Zanon (retreating is fine). Do not fully complete Zanon's storyline before getting this achievement as he will disappear and Ryskim will not reappear and kidnap Yanna.

_Win two battles in a single encounter with Leon by having two enemy generals opt to retreat instead of duel him_

Magician and Priest generals are by far the most likely to retreat from duels, but they will also retreat from battles almost as soon as their last troops get killed. Sometimes you will find a retreating enemy army that has just been defeated and no longer has any troops. One that has several generals with significantly lower HP than Leon is likely to be useful for this achievement. Make sure Leon has no troops, but high HP to give yourself the best chance at an enemy general retreat.

_Wrest Eclisis from Zanon, subdue him and then recruit him_

This is the most complex Zanon storyline in the game. It requires a series of interactions with Zanon and armies not containing Gongos as well as subsequent domestic events. Ultimately you cannot mess it up, but always attempt to approach Zanon first with an army that does not contain Gongos and if that doesn't trigger a new event, then try an army that does contain Gongos. It is highly recommended that until the final encounter, after you've rescued Katt from Ryskim, to retreat from Zanon encounters when possible. You will also ocassionally get domestic events related to Zanon. In order to get him to join, you must progress all the way passed the Katt rescue event and then approach Zanon with a party that contains Gongos and his four main generals, Rygar, Baghib, Katt and Yuni. This will trigger the event in which Eclisis is taken from Zanon and he will join following a battle. Unfortunately it is so late in the game by the time this happens that Zanon is essentially useless as a playable general. This achievement is missable if you do not confront Zanon with the correct party for the final event.

If not, equip her with it during the next domestic session.

_Kill more than 60 troops using Junon's Sonic Blast skill. Junon cannot be using mage or archer troops_

Do not have Junon in command of mage or archer troops even if none are recruited. This achievement is easiest to earn fighting against a monarch with 100 troops when Junon starts with none. The enemy will immediately issue a melee command and all troops with collapse into the middle and charge Junon. This will create a very nice grouping for Sonic Blast to strike. The initial enemy troop formations do play a small factor in how the troops group and lead to various numbers of troops getting killed. Over 70 kills at once is possible.

Engage and defeat Scythe in battle with Scar. This will not trigger if she retreats, so if she does, pursue her and try again. This achievement is missable once Junon visits the Shadow Tower and Scythe and Gaul disappear.  Upon returning, Scythe is no longer in her first form and this achievement will remain locked.

_Defeat Manoa of Palemoon with Cinna_

Attack and defeat the army of which Manoa is part with a force including Cinna. If Manoa is in the same location as Teiris, ensure that Junon is not also part of your force otherwise Palemoon will join without fighting. Additionally, it is recommended to retreat after unlocking this achievement because if Teiris is captured then the achievement [Tristan] Birds of a Feather [m] cannot be unlocked. In the case where Manoa is with Teiris, first attack with a force not including Junon. When Manoa is up to fight, defeat her with Cinna then have your entire force retreat. Regroup and send Junon to engage Teiris next to get both achievements.

Several weeks/months after Vlad is recruited an event will trigger where Ryskim and Sierra appear. Vlad must be part of the force that defeats them. After the subsequent event where Vlad restores Sierra's senses, she will be moved into the hospital. She will automatically recover and join after a few weeks at most. This achievement will be missed if Ryskim is engaged and defeated without Vlad in the army.

Visit the town immediately south of Mikeral castle with your monarch to trigger an event and fight with Shirox. Defeating him will force another event at the next domestic session. After that, leave and return to the town with your monarch to initiate a fight with Hayate. Defeat him and he and Shirox will join at the subsequent domestic session. The Shirox and Hayate events depend on whether your monarch is aware they are part of the Dragon Force. Most monarchs can recruit Shirox and Hayate from the start of the game, but Gongos in particular must wait until nearly the end of the campaign though.

_Recruit Vangal_

Recruiting Vangal varies slightly between campaigns, but always requires a town to be visited by your monarch. Vangal may either fight you and immediately join or disappear for several weeks and rejoin after another dragon general, Zado attacks you. In any case, all that is needed is to trigger the initial town event and the rest will play out quickly. Fandaria cannot initiate these events. The Vangal town event can be found in the following towns for each campaign:

Highland and Palemoon - Second town to the west of Galfiel castle, it's the one in the mountains
Izumo - Town immediately southwest of Danyan castle
Tradnor - Town north of Estonia castle
Topaz, Bozack and Tristan - Town between Travan and Crystal castles

Bastion will start the area north of the Fiend Tower. He may remain at the town, but he may also move based on other kingdom's forces encountering him. Approach him with a female general and he will join your forces. If approached by a male general, you will fight him and upon defeating him he will be captured and this achievement will be locked.

Castle level's will gradually increase while you are occupying them on them on the field or through domestic fortifications. You must be in occupying a castle when it reaches level 50 through either method to unlock this achievement. Palemoon castle generally starts a high level, so send some of your generals who can fortify there and continue fortify during domestic sessions and do not vacate the castle during the weeks.

_Defeat the Skull Chidren, Gasper, Helm and Tzuvan_

The Skull Children spawn in randomly near the beginning of the campaign and try to directly attack your monarch from wherever their starting location is. If they encounter and are defeated by another kingdom's general they will not respawn anymore and will be replaced by Paine and Agonni. The Skull Children are not uncommon, so if you intend to master the set, you will almost certainly have several chances to earn this achievement. The Skull Children do not spawn during the Fandaria campaign.

***

_Kill Paine and Agonni... at least for the time being_

After the Skull Children are defeated, Paine and Agonni will spawn in almost weekly and attempt to reach your monarch. They will never retreat from battle, so just kill them with any available force capable of doing so and you will unlock this achievement.

After visiting the Shadow Tower and witnessing Gaul and Scythe's disappearance, they will ambush your monarch as they are leaving the area surrounding the Shadow Tower.

The special skills Assassin Star and Mirage Star possessed by ninja generals will deplete the enemy's special skill charging meter. Different general's have varying degrees of success with the skills, so depending who you are using it may take a well timed use after the enemy general uses a skill of their own or possibly more. The thief general skill, Shiva's Dagger is also viable.

_Defeat an enemy force of at least eight generals_

Only armies in a castle can contain more than five generals. Finding a castle with eight or more generals can be difficult and it will almost always be Tradnor, but others may do this from time to time. A much more reliable method is to bring a general with four or more (depending on how many enemy generals are already present) to Lightan castle and immediately retreating. The captives will transfer over to Zanon's control and then he will recruit them by the beginning of the next week. He will not deploy these generals so Lightan castle will be sufficient although you will have to face Zanon in the final battle, so only give up weak generals.

Using troops with significant advantages over the opponents such as beastmen over cavalry, monks/mages over zombies or samurai over dragons will give you the highest probability of success.  Additionally using a general with a power skill such as Teiris's Dark Vortex or one with Sonic Blast will make this achievement more easily doable.

Unless the campaign lasts for an incredibly long time, Mikhal will likely be the only general that will command 100 samurai at once. Using a Dragon Crest that can be found in Crystal castle will enable any of your generals to command dragon troops. Select a general with a skill like Teiris's Dark Vortex or Sonic Blast in order to significantly reduce the number of samurai troops.
