Some cool works being done by the RetroAchievements fans.

## RAPodcast

In the last month the guys behind the official RetroAchievements Podcast released one new episode:

- [RAPodcast Episode 14 - BudCaveTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7zgxDEfS6Y)
- [RAPodcast Episode 15 - RARoundtable #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2KRrbkH1g8)

Kudos to {% rauser Draco655 %}, {% rauser Shootzy %} and {% rauser KingS1zzle %} to keep this running.
