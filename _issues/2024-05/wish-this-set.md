The [Leo](https://retroachievements.org/game/15334) version of the first game and [Zerker x Ninja](https://retroachievements.org/game/15656) version of the second have sets already, but neither version of 3 does. There are 59 requests for Black Ace and 5 for Red Joker. The conclusion of the trilogy, this is the story of how protagonist Geo Stelar finally gets reunited with his missing father, as he stops the plans of the sinister group, Joker. It has new features the previous games lack, including Galaxy Advances, which work like [Battle Network](https://retroachievements.org/game/9034)'s Program Advances, and Noise Changes, a new power-up system. You can also obtain illegal Battle Cards - cards from the previous two games which wouldn't normally be obtainable - by doing well in battles. You could earn achievements for defeating bosses, completing the libraries, obtaining many cards, accessing post-game content, gaining brotherbands, and lots more - there's a lot to do in this game.

Now, I'm a fan of horror media. Slasher movies, sci-fi horror, kaiju monsters, you name it. And this video game, serving as a sequel to the iconic John Carpenter movie of the same name from 1982, is one that was not only well-received by critics and fans (with Carpenter himself endorsing it as canon and even cameoing in it), but a title I look fondly at, with a gripping story taking place in the aftermath of the original movie that captures the isolation and paranoia the original movie gave off, and some superb voice acting from the cast, with William B. Davis (best known as for his role as the Cigarette Smoking Man in _The X-Files_) being a stand-out as Colonel Whitney. Alas, a set for this title has eluded RA ever since PS2 integration became a thing, and while there initially was a set released, for reasons unknown, it was pulled almost as soon as it was released.

Still, though, I, no doubt along with the 26 others who requested a set for this game, would be interested in seeing this game get the love it deserves. Aside from the obligatory "level completion" or "beat game on X difficulty" achievements, some of the achievements could also be tied to certain aspects, like "kill X amount of creatures" or "complete level while only using X", those kinds of achievements to add more replayability in Captain Blake's journey through the ruined Antarctica outpost and his fight to survive the shape-shifting aliens, all while working with other survivors, who know that nobody can be trusted as, to quote one of the movie's most iconic lines... _"If I was an imitation, a perfect imitation, how would you know if it was really me?"_

Either way, if you're a fan of Survival Horror titles like [Resident Evil](https://retroachievements.org/game/7236) or [The Suffering](https://retroachievements.org/game/3005), or are even familiar with the 1982 movie, you'd be in for a treat with this title.

## Star Wars: Demolition (PlayStation, Dreamcast)

Star Wars: Demolition was [LucasArts](https://retroachievements.org/game/8946)' response to the [Twisted Metal](https://retroachievements.org/game/8125)s and [Vigilante 8](https://retroachievements.org/game/3017)s of the era, and I believe they made an amazing submission to the [Vehicular Combat](https://retroachievements.org/game/7811) genre. As a fan of Star Wars growing up, it was so much fun driving around in the Landspeeders, Tanks, Swoops, or even flying around as Boba Fett with his Jet Pack or riding the back of a Rancor. The landscapes are just as varied as well, including the cities on Tatooine or Bespin, or the surface of the Death Star and Yavin IV. The game provides special cutscenes based on which vehicle/character you use during the tournament mode, and each vehicle has its own special ability. This isn't the only mode, though. The game also provides an alternate mode, Probe Droid Hunt. In this mode, each contestant must hunt down the probe droids on each map, getting the most takedowns before time runs out.

I believe this game deserves a set for a few reasons. One, it is just fun. Of all the vehicular combat games I have played, this one has stuck with me the most. The second, is that it is a game based on a popular IP that has most of its games with sets. And the third, there is a lot to unlock and do in the game lending it to having a fun set. Either the PlayStation or Dreamcast version should be able to get it, as I believe they are the same content wise. I hope that others are able to discover the fun provided by this game like I was as I was growing up!

## \~Hack~ Mario Party Legacy: Custom Boards - Mario Party 3 (Nintendo 64)

With the 2 former games, Mario Party [1](https://retroachievements.org/game/17856) and [2](https://retroachievements.org/game/17868), having their own sets for custom boards, I think that Mario Party 3 should also get some love. In case you didn't know, there's a whole community out there who creates custom boards for the N64 titles. And let me tell ya, there's a pretty decent amount of them. It can be a hit or miss thing, but the ones that hit, are truly some good stuff. Feel like going back into the SNES era? Try the Yoshi's Island board! Wanna go into the future instead? Give the demake of Faire Square of Mario Party 6 a try! Are you a huge Mario Galaxy fan as I am? Luma's Playground got you covered! A fresh board mechanic is what you want? We got Big Boo's Black Hole Boardwalk right served up! That doesn't even scratch the surface (maybe it does) of how many custom boards await you. If you are a Mario Party fan, this is going to be a fun time for you. And if you aren't really a Mario Party fan, you will also have some good times with this. So hold onto your seats, because its party time!

## Breaker's Revenge (Arcade)

This is a fighting game released in 1998 on the Neo-Geo, basically a remaster of [Breaker's](https://retroachievements.org/game/13761) with a new character and some improvements mainly in the graphics. The original game already has a set on RA, but I would also like if the better version received one too. What's so special about this game? It took a lot of inspiration from [Street Fighter II](https://retroachievements.org/game/11808), not only by being a fighting game but actually by copying the characters, movesets, and the feel of the game overall. By playing the game for a bit, you may notice that some characters are remixes in a way of SF2 characters: Alsion III vs Dhalsim, Condor vs T.Hawk, Tia vs Chun-li, ...

This game is kinda obscure because by the time it was released, the FGC had moved onto better looking games like [Street Fighter III](https://retroachievements.org/game/12274), but I believe this is a game worth checking out if you are a fan of fighting games. It's basically SF2 but with faster and more fluid gameplay.

I've been playing video games for literally as long as I can remember. That's not hyperbole, I can't remember anything about preschool, but I do know that three-year-old-me would spend hours on the minigames in [Pokemon Stadium](https://retroachievements.org/game/10181). But even so, I was still too young to "get" video gaming, and it wasn't until I was five and my parents got me and my older brother a GameCube for Christmas that this passion of mine began to establish itself. And with it, my brother got [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4](https://retroachievements.org/game/3803), and I got this unassuming game based on a favorite toy brand of mine, Hot Wheels: Velocity X. Of course kid-me wouldn't know about the licensed game stigma of the era, but kid-me for sure loved this game. And not too long ago, with an equal measure of curiosity and trepidation, I tried it again as an adult... and I can see why. This game is actually pretty damn good.

The best way I can describe the gameplay is a prototypical Burnout Paradise. You've got city environments with all of racing, exploration, and vehicular combat events taking place directly in the overworld - the biggest difference being that it's not one large single city, but five smaller zones with different environments, more typical for the era. There's also a story mode that progresses through each zone, one after the other, where you alternate between the three gameplay objectives depending on the chapter. I remember having a lot of difficulty with the later chapters as a kid, and I'm not sure if I ever beat it then either. I didn't play it long enough as an adult to know whether I was just worse at games because I was a kid, or if it's legitimately challenging, but I'd be more motivated to return if it got a set.

The combat is another break in my Burnout Paradise comparison, being instead a weapons-based arena match affair in the style of [Twisted Metal](https://retroachievements.org/game/8125). You pick your primary weapon at the start of each chapter, and you unlock more as you go on. And the exploration is also fairly well thought out, but given that most chapters are either on a timer or versus the CPU, this is mainly reserved for free exploration in a side mode. There are multiple places where ramps and quarter-pipes can take you on top of buildings to find hidden secrets and unlockables, including full-blown new vehicles. Having said all of this, I will point out that nothing in this game is particularly exceptional, but the fact that it is able to do all of this genuinely well in a cohesive package is an accomplishment.

I mostly want this game to get a set just to relive my memories yet again, but I'm also hoping for others to give this game a chance. There's no lack of arcade racing games for the PS2 and GC era, to say nothing of the landfills stuffed with mediocre licensed games, but that doesn't mean this should be overlooked.

Mappy is one of the most iconic and greatest arcade games ever made. Despite being released in 1983, it doesn't feel like it has aged a day. It has a lot of depth and mechanics to master that can keep even the most seasoned veterans coming back.

You play as Mappy, a police mouse who has to protect his museum from the criminal organization of cats called the Meowkies, lead by their leader Goro.

Mappy is a maze chase game with the twist of gravity. The only way to avoid enemies is by falling onto a trampoline, during which you're invincible. Be careful though, because trampolines will break if used too many times in a row without landing on the ground. The goal of each stage is to simply collect each artifact to advance to the next stage before the Meowkies catch you. However, the game is deceptively deep when it comes to its gameplay loop.

Normal Meowkies follow a very predictable pattern. They will take the most direct route to you as possible based on their location. Their main threat is their numbers, as there can be up to 7 of them at a time in addition to Goro himself. Goro on the other hand, goes directly for the treasures. He won't chase Mappy, he'll follow a somewhat predetermined path between each treasure, hiding behind each of them for a moment when he reaches them. If Mappy collects a treasure when Goro is behind them, you're awarded with 1k bonus points. This is pretty risky, unless you can predict the direction Goro is going.

The whole game is risk vs reward. Another major mechanic in this game is matching treasures. There are 2 of each artifact in the same location on each stage. Collecting both corresponding artifacts sequentially without dying gives you a multiplier. Doing this successively increases the multiplier. Each artifact is worth a different value from 100 to 500 - Radio, TV, Computer, Painting, and Safe. You have to choose when to go for the most possible points, and when survival is a better option. A perfect run of each stage ends in a very satisfying "500 x 6", but you have to be very on point with routing the enemies as the stage layouts get more and more complicated.

The game is all about opening and closing doors to stun and evade the Meowkies, and exploiting their predictable AI to avoid them and route them into the path of the rainbow doors in order for the beam to hit as many of them as possible. Hitting Goro in the same beam doubles any points you would have gotten from the normal cats. Doors, including rainbow doors, can be opened from anywhere as long as you're facing them, even if you're across a gap. Normal doors may not give you big points like the limited rainbow doors do, but they can be used strategically to slam into enemies to stun them, as well as to close on yourself to boost forward through enemies in a tight situation. The gameplay is a very satisfying loop of appropriate cat-and-mouse chase gameplay that I believe anyone would have fun with if they gave it a proper try.

Bandits 9 was a game that caught my eye as soon as I booted it up - while lacking an English translation at this time, it's a turn-based strategy similar to the [Fire Emblem](https://retroachievements.org/game/7022) series, with a party of nine bandits that move around on a grid and can attack adjacent tiles. The game has an interesting aspect in that there is no concept of levels or experience - instead, your units' strength is dependent on their equipment. This means that you could choose to focus on a few bandits, making them stronger and using them to collect the gold to equip the bandits that you didn't use. The game also features two different stories/scenarios, but they play like two halves of the same story, allowing you to start at either point.

Ah, the [Worms](https://retroachievements.org/game/9555) series. A game series that asked the question, "What if earthworms were violent and had access to a myriad of explosives and weapons?" Turns out they’d blow each other up in a turn-based game of strategy, in wacky cartoon-y fashion!

As a series, Worms is pretty underrepresented on RA. Only 4 of the games have sets, and I feel like the games need more love. Case in point, Worms: Open Warfare 2! I chose the DS version specifically because it's the one I'm most familiar with. There's not much difference between the DS and PSP versions besides graphics and some modes.

So, why pick the second game instead of the first? Well, that's easy; 2 is an improvement on 1 in every way! More weapons, more gameplay modes, more customization, more everything! Campaign, Puzzle, Training, and Laboratory modes for single player, and a very customizable multiplayer experience. There are tons of weapons to use for a variety of situations, lots of different landscape types to work around, and multiple "schemes", which change the game rules in a variety of ways to make for a very replayable game. Lots of hours of fun to be had, here!

I feel like this game has great achievement potential, and I'd like for more people to experience this game as well! This game only has two requests (including me lol), so if you enjoy the Worms series, or even just turn-based strategy games, then you should absolutely wish the set. See you on the battlefield, and watch out for those mines!

I want to ask for a set for game Demon of Laplace, one of the most unique RPG games I have ever encountered. It delves into the horror genre, tasking players with assembling a diverse team to navigate through a spooky haunted house. Progression in the game requires a balanced team composition, with each member fulfilling a specific role crucial for advancement. Among the essential roles is the Detective, serving as the classic fighter archetype. Additionally, having a Medium on the team is vital for dealing damage to ghosts, as they possess the unique ability required for combating them. Furthermore, there is also need for Journalist, despite not being a fighter, they play a important role in capturing and selling images of supernaturals, providing a only source of income necessary for success.

Since the first time I heard about this game I can't stop thinking about it and I think someone who is good with RPGs can make a banger set for this title. And as a bonus, it has an translation, while being JP exclusive.
