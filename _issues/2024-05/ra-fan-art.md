Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up and Challenge League Top 100 events.

**If you have made fan art for Bendyhuman's Challenge League Top 100 task and you want us to showcase your art, please send them to our inbox or let any of our members know, thank you! Any other fan art is also welcome!**

Link is no stranger to finding (and hurting) Cucco's, but this one looks a little bit different... it also looks like user Timenoe! How did he find himself in Link's hands?!

It is night. Detective Dick Tracy is on the job in his signature yellow coat, solving crimes by staring at villains with his deep dead eyes. Surely that's what he is trying to do right?

Ryu has ditched the Hayabusa clan. Instead, he realised that there is a way better one out there: the RetroAchievements clan! Let's see how our favourite ninja's skills stack up in the gaming world!

The Ninja Turtles are off in the deep sewers again, being surrounded by Mousers! They left their older family member behind though, who ends up being stuck in Mario's dreams. At least that will make the job easier!
