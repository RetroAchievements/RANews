| {% raachpic 21734, 21596, Stronger Than Jaws %} | Catch a shark with an estimated weight of 1200lbs. or greater. | 50     |

Goes without saying that it's not easy to land this massive shark. There are three factors that helped me to do it. First, start a new game and go directly to the default map in Florida, Palm Beach. Set line length to 100, strength to 160lb, and change the lure to Fluorescent. I don't think I hooked a shark with any other lure besides Fluorescent. Second, level up all stats (Body, Muscle, and Skill). Easiest way to do that is by hooking and landing any fish at all. The Skill stat is RNG so, it's just a grind. Use emulation fast forward and try to spawn RNG events during the fight. Third...even with max stats, I had a shark hooked that I could not gain much for getting close to the boat. Eventually the line snapped. So, I'm sad to say that what *did* yield the landing of the shark when I hooked it later in the same session was also the RNG event of "GO FOR IT! THE FISH IS VERY EXHAUSTED." So, it's a matter of grinding and luck.

| {% raachpic 21735, 21586, Eleventh Hour Superpower %} | In the final 15 minutes of any day, hook and land your day winning billfish. | 50     |

Up to this point, the player should not be keeping any fish. There's no need to risk putting any fish in the livewell - another player points out that, when trying for this achievement, no fish besides the one caught in the last 15 minutes of the day should be brought to weigh in. I wasn't willing to test to see if they were wrong. So, the easiest and fastest way to pull this off is after grinding for that shark. Your stats are at max so any fight with a billfish will go easily. Since you are still on the first day tournament, you are guaranteed to win it if you bring a fish of 500lb or more to weigh in. To expedite things, make your boat collide with a land solid object four times to trigger a caption event. On the third caption, the boat goes back to dock for repairs, fast forwarding the day's time by 2 hours. Repeat this until you are somewhat close to the 15:00 hour. The achievement description clearly states "hook and land" in the final 15 minutes. I wasn't taking any chances hooking the fish BEFORE 15:45 so, I waited. Once 15:45 happened, I hooked and landed a fish of 700lb (remember, guaranteed to win with 500lb or more). As another player points out, the player should not wait for the time to run out (which automatically brings you to dock / weigh in). Again, I took no chances testing that and, instead, steered the boat to dock and weighed in. Achievement unlocked!
