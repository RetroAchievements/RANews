Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

We have over 1000 Pokémon but still no yam? This needs to change. Leave it to pickledyamsman to design his very own Pokémon evolution line! This grass-type Pokémon is ready to join your team--and hey, it can learn Earthquake! Now THIS is a good Pokémon alright.

Did you know that this RAnews issue comes with two covers? We got Custom Robo, but we also have... a bunch of coloured Yoshis sticking out their tongue! Gotta love the variety on display here!

Remember the meme of Doomguy and Isabelle being best friends with their games releasing on the same day? Well, I'm happy to announce that they are still best friends, with them hanging out at the beach eating some ice cream. I'm sure Doomguy will happily accept that break!
