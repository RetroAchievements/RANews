## Legend of Zelda, The: Collector's Edition (GameCube)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Console  | Genre                                                       |

I was slightly surprised when I saw this wasn't part of the GC rollout. I know having to use the GameCube controller on NES/N64 is off-putting to some, but it has some of the best Zelda games ever released ~~and [Zelda 2](https://retroachievements.org/game/1453)~~ (I actually like Zelda 2) on one disc. Sets already exist for [Zelda 1](https://retroachievements.org/game/1454), [OoT](https://retroachievements.org/game/10113), and [MM](https://retroachievements.org/game/10679) obviously, so most of the regular gameplay achievements are there already. What I think could be most intriguing for a set/subset would be some kind of theme that stretches across multiple games - have 22/44/66/88 total hearts/life across all full games, obtain musical instruments in all games+demos, etc. The demo itself could have achievements also; while [Wind Waker](https://retroachievements.org/game/9190) has a set already, the demo has a 20 minute time limit and some areas are not present on the disc (i.e. Tower of the Gods and Hyrule), so doing certain tasks could have a different challenge than the regular version.

Rally Cross is sort of a hidden gem of a racing game. It is a first party game produced in-house by Sony. In a weird sort of way it can kinda be seen as the precursor to the [MotorStorm](https://retroachievements.org/game/20870) series. The game features single play, championship mode, time trial, and other modes. Each race consist of you and three other racers for a total of four vehicles. The game features tracks of different locales, mud, snow, asphalt, and sand. Racing on snowy terrain causes the vehicles to slide and skid all over the place, but by accelerating and braking you can still keep control of your vehicle. The damage model is somewhat advanced for its time; all sides of the vehicle can become damaged, even the top. You can intentionally flip your vehicle, and while it's easy for some vehicles to roll over, you can rock your vehicle back on its wheels by using the shoulder buttons. The game features many different vehicles that each have their own attributes for acceleration, top speed, and handling. As you progress through the game you unlock more tracks and vehicles. The game has an awesome hard-rock instrumental soundtrack. It also supports 4-player split-screen. If you're looking for a fun arcadey racing game with some fun physics, give Rally Cross a try!

In 2003 and 2004, the number-crunching minds of [Nippon Ichi Software](https://retroachievements.org/game/18932) came together to bestow both Disgaea: Hour of Darkness and Phantom Brave onto the world, gracing Memory Cards with hundreds upon hundreds of hours of leveling, grinding, collecting, and confining, a dazzling gemstone to the PS2's library of RPGs. One year later, they proved they could refine that gem into something spectacular.

Fusing the chaotically zany nature of [Disgaea](https://retroachievements.org/game/1075) to the gameplay beats of both it and Phantom Brave, Makai Kingdom offers a substantial treasure trove of gameplay to digest with no wrong ways to approach it. Ten medics ganging on an Overlord with frying pans? You can do that! A Prinny inside a mecha suit battling it out with Thunder Gods? By all means! From its simplistic yet captivating story, the in-your-face presentation and humor, and the hours upon hours of customizable gameplay, Makai Kingdom sports an identity that hits all the marks to make an NIS game pop out in the face of any RPG fan, and by extension, as a set worthwhile to hang up on your profile.

Will you take the chance to \[INVITE] the "Most Badass Freakin' Game In The Entire Cosmos" into RA history? Let fate dictate the rest of the story...

## Mr. Driller: Drill Land (GameCube)

I'd like to wish for Mr. Driller: Drill Land on the GameCube. It has 5 different modes, is very easy to pick up and play (mostly), and is an incredibly underrated gem on the system. Though the GCN version was only released in Japanese, you can play the game fine without knowing Japanese with the exception maybe of Tower of Druaga, which even then with a quick guide isn't too hard to figure out. It has that fun arcade feel of easy to learn yet hard to master, and is quite addicting. Plus, the soundtrack was done by Go Shiina, and if you haven't listened to it, there was absolutely ZERO reasons for him to go as hard as he did on this soundtrack, but he did and I can't recommend it enough. Seriously, just listen to the song [Kenshakou](https://youtu.be/UXDCtfZpEQw?si=JatMTHcuJeyHxhW2). It's an amazing and emotional song that probably doesn't need to be in a cutesy anime game about drilling, but it is and I'm very glad for it!

## Gradius Gaiden (PlayStation)

This is one of my favorite [Gradius](https://retroachievements.org/game/2849) games in the series. It basically has the running power of the PlayStation (like [Gradius V](https://retroachievements.org/game/19051)), while maintaining the colorful aspects of the previous games. There's lots of replayability with the different ships and upgrade slot customization. Heck, there's even some secrets that can only be done on a certain difficulty or other routes. The one thing that sorta bothered me is that this is the only Gradius game that doesn't have an achievement list. It'll be nice to complete this Gradius game with it, especially as it is one of the more underrated of the bunch.

Hey RA Team! I'm here to tell you about a franchise that is very near and dear to my heart that I feel is totally overlooked on this website: [Monster Rancher](https://retroachievements.org/game/5500)! Monster Rancher began in 1997 in hopes to compete with Pokémon and Digimon. The unique premise behind this game was you raised your monsters on a farm, hence the Japanese name for the series being Monster Farm, and entered them in tournaments after you raised their stats. What really set this game series apart was the ability to scan CDs, including music discs, DVDs, and other games, to get new monsters! The games would prompt you to remove the game disc, put in the disc you want read, take that disc out, and return the game disc. It was really cool!

Despite being a niche series it still managed to have 15 games and an anime series! Some of the games on the GBA even let you use code words to obtain new monsters. It also had some really fun card game spin-offs! The monsters I've always felt were uniquely designed from absolutely adorable to extremely cool looking! They were original and felt very unique.

However, in this series there is one game that of course is my absolute favorite: Monster Rancher 3. It was released on the PS2 and somehow still to this day is one of the most cozy games I've ever played or seen. They went all out on giving you different locations to raise your monsters, and even let you explore these locations with your monsters! It really added a unique sense of bonding with raising your creatures in a way I've never seen another game capture. On top of that, the game has really vibrant colors that just pop and feel so warm and relaxing. The graphics are cute and charming, plus the music just lends itself so well to the overall tone of the game. The atmosphere is just oozing with comfortable vibes and cozy feelings that the game has always stood out to me.

Monster Rancher 3 has always felt overlooked in a series that is already obscure and niche to the gaming world. I've put countless hours into it as a young girl and feel like it deserves a chance to have the spotlight shone on it now that I'm older. I would love to see this gorgeous game have a wonderful set. I feel it could help encourage players to win all the tournaments, raise the best monsters, explore the wonderfully unique areas, and see everything this charming little game has to offer.

Unreal Tournament is one of the greatest FPS games of all time, and quite frankly it deserves way more respect than it currently gets. Long before the days of Fortnite, Unreal was Epic Games' flagship franchise back in the day, to the point where it's the namesake of their signature engine. Developed as a multiplayer arena shooter, the game is jampacked with content, even on the watered down console ports. With over 40+ well crafted battlefields, 13 tools of destruction, and a multitude of mutators to change up the gameplay, UT99 is bound to keep you fragging for hours upon hours.

By the end of 2001, the original PC version sold over 2 million copies, enough to warrant some sequels and spin-offs, as well as a couple of ports. Released as a US launch title, the PS2 version of Unreal Tournament brought the carnage to split-screen with a few exclusive maps. The Dreamcast would follow suit near the end of its lifespan, with the addition of online play via SegaNet and a LOT more exclusive maps, even if they're just ripped from the then popular Rocket Arena mod. Of course, these ports were far from perfect; not only were they riddled with performance issues, but not all the content was brought over from the PC version, namely certain maps as well as Assault mode for the Dreamcast release. The default controls for the DualShock 2 and Dreamcast controllers aren't...ideal, to put it nicely, but thankfully you can customize the layout, or even just use keyboard and mouse.

Sadly, Epic Games does not look back so fondly on the series that put them on the map. Not only have they cancelled Unreal Tournament 4, but they've also delisted the rest of the franchise on digital storefronts and shut down the original master servers. Thankfully, the community lives on, opting to kill each other on custom servers, and continuing to make custom maps, mods, characters and patches to this day. If the console ports were ever to receive achievement sets, I'm sure it will bring in new fans to the long forgotten Unreal franchise, as well as have older ones take a look at this...interesting chapter in the franchise's history.

(Also side note but considering the PC version of [Final Fantasy XI](https://retroachievements.org/game/28275) has an achievement set, I think it'd be possible to mod RA support into the original UT99, among other PC classics...not expecting it to happen, but it'd be nice!)

My submission is for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game Wacky Worlds Creativity Studio. This fun little game I used to enjoy as a kid is basically Sega's version of [Mario Paint](https://retroachievements.org/game/1013), minus an actual paint program. Instead of painting you place animated "stickers" onto the worlds with a hand cursor called the Glove, and color with the Coloring Glove. You can animate the stickers with the Magic Glove. There's also a Music Machine where you can, as the name suggests, make music. While I admit I think it might be a touch difficult to do, I'd honestly love to see what people come up with for an achievement set.

Chibi-Robo! The forgotten mascot.

Chibi-Robo is a tiny robot whose sole purpose is to bring happiness to everyone who has the pleasure of meeting him. Living in a big house, Chibi-Robo has to clean, tidy up, take care of the problems of the inhabitants (each more unique than the other), be there for the family, solve mysteries, and lots of other little things. The Chibi-Robo [series](https://retroachievements.org/game/20139) began with the excellent [GameCube](https://retroachievements.org/game/25431) game, which had the honor of being part of the console rollout on July 15. This follow-up, only available on Nintendo DS and in Japan, had a very nice fan translation called Chibi-Robo! Clean Sweep! and is the direct sequel to the GameCube opus.

My most wished for set is bit Generations: Dotstream!

[bit Generations](https://retroachievements.org/game/7002) was a series of "micro" games released by Nintendo in two batches in July of 2006, exclusively in Japan. Each game was released in a super stylish tiny white box that matched the minimalist aesthetic of the games themselves. I imported them at the time based almost completely on the look of these boxes - there was something very compelling about game boxes that wouldn't look out of place next to a coffee table art book. The games themselves vary wildly in quality, but the best of them are very addictive, very simple games. The superb [Dialhex](https://retroachievements.org/game/8869) and [Orbital](https://retroachievements.org/game/8817) already have sets, but Dotstream was always my favourite of the series.

Dotstream is a line racer that encouraged precision, featuring gorgeous neon graphics and a fantastic chiptune soundtrack. It's kind of like [Wipeout](https://retroachievements.org/game/8230) crossed with [Rez](https://retroachievements.org/game/3419) and then reduced to its absolute barest components. Across five GPs you are a line and you race against a bunch of other lines, hitting speed boosts, collecting items, and avoiding obstacles. It's a very cool, very addictive slice of strange GBA esoterica which I would love to see some achievements for!
