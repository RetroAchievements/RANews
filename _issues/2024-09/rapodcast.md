# Episode 23 - The Sacred Geometry: GameCube

With each new episode we record, we attempt to reach further into the mechanics of RA. To learn a little bit more, and appreciate a bunch; the efforts and contributions that all of us here do to make our community possible and enjoyable.

Today though, we didn't have to reach very far - On the forefront of most every players, and more than a few developers radar, is the release of the beloved Gamecube. A conole cherished by most all who encountered it, a small boxy colored unit of promised fun was hard to pass up, much less go unappreciated.

In turn, we at RA have shown OUR appreciation to the console, to it's legacy, to the impact and road it and Nintendo chose to pave; no matter how difficult or risky. 

For exactly that reason, I have my guest here today, Gollawiz; to dig in on one of the communities favorite consoles. To talk features, to talk beloved games, to reminisce, and to talk of what GameCube could mean for RA; and what it has done for us so far.
