# 2) Introduction

Often praised as one of the greatest RPGs of all time, Final Fantasy 6 is the story of a young girl born with magical abilities in a world where magic was destroyed long ago.  It was my introduction to Final Fantasy and RPGs in general, so it holds a special place in my heart.  The game boasts an impressive cast, quick combat and excellent music.  The set was primarily created by [cirellio](https://retroachievements.org/user/cirellio) with additional achievements by [televandalist](https://retroachievements.org/user/televandalist). Many of the achievements in the set are showcases of easter eggs or unique dialog, making a large portion of them missable during a normal playthrough. This guide will tackle the achievements in chronological order to get the most out of your playthrough.

# 3) Walkthrough

## Before you Begin
This guide frequently references the World of Balance (WoB) and the World of Ruin (WoR).  These terms refer to the locations from the first and second half of the game respectively.

Several achievements that require specific actions, such as not opening a chest or purchasing an item, but the achievement does not unlock until additional actions are taken much later in the game.  These are noted with 🚩 in the guide, but here is a summary:
* 🚩 Do not open any chests in South Figaro Cave in the World of Balance. 🚩
* 🚩 Do not open the chest containing Rune Edge in the Moogle Cave of the Narshe Mines. 🚩
* 🚩 Do not purchase both Magicite in the Jidoor Auction House until you win the Zephyr Cloak in the World of Ruin. 🚩
* 🚩 Rescue Mog in the World of Balance and learn the Water Rondo dance in Serpent Trench. 🚩
* 🚩 Make a separate save file on the Floating Continent. 🚩
* 🚩 Do not attack Doom Gaze until the party can kill it in 4 turns. 🚩

Two achievements are mutually exclusive depending on choices made.  Most of these occur late in the game, so creating a separate save file at the split is recommended.  
* [Beyond the Shadows I (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5653) and [Beyond the Shadows II (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5132)  
Create a separate save on the Floating Continent.  
* [Illuminated! (4)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7299) and [Life, Crystalized (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6618)  
Create a separate save before choosing which form Ragnarok should take in Narshe (WoR).

[LLG (50)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7296)**  
_Clear the game with no character exceeding level 30_

While doing a single playthrough is possible for this set, many people will prefer to do this achievement on a 2nd playthrough.  That said, most LLG guides for Final Fantasy 6 aim for level 10 or lower, so this is quite lenient compared to a minimal LLG run.  Here are some tips that can help:
* Run away from as many battles as you can and aim to leave the WoB with all characters level 25 or lower.
* Put all characters in the back row to reduce damage while running away. Magic and special commands like Throw and Blitz will still do full damage. 
* Most bosses do not grant exp.  The Veldt region also does not granted exp, so it can be used to earn GP and learn Magic.  
* Some exp is unavoidable such as the Mine Cart and Air Force sequence.  Some random encounters also prevent running, such as Ninjas on the Floating Continent.
* Earned exp is retained after the party is annihilated.  If farming for a drop, be sure to reset after each exp granting kill.
* In the unpatched versions, the evade stat is bugged and uses the magic evade value instead. Stack Magic Evade % to avoid most attacks.
* Obtain the Genji Glove by rejecting Banon's offer 3 times.  Buy two Morning Stars and equip them on Locke for big damage in the WoB. 
* Ultima is extremely powerful in the WoR and should be taught to many team members once Ragnarok is obtained.
* Gau has some powerful rages that can make bosses much easier.

[Beastlord (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5432) & Others**  
Mastery requires learning all of Gau's Rage abilities from the Veldt.  In order for monsters to appear on the Veldt, they must first be encountered in the world.  Each section will begin with a list of the monsters you can encounter and marked with a ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/223925308-05cdd86e-eb5b-4f21-9c0c-60e07e2f55ef.png).  Ensure that you run into at least 1 formation so that you can collect their rage on the Veldt later in the game.  For Low Level playthroughs, you can simply run away from the battle and it will still count.  Check the entries in the main guide for additional tips to optimize this process.

Use this spreadsheet to track the enemies you have encountered:  [Gau Rage Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16ophKhgLjYwCdvqEqAsJqVn-XrwLD-GGd2XVsNK8S_A/)  
* Check the first column when the party encounters an enemy in the wild
* Check the second column when Gau Leaps or returns to the party during a Veldt encounter with that enemy.
* Check the third column when Gau's Rage list under Skills contains that enemy.

_Watch the snowfield scene without skipping_

When starting the game, watch the entire opening credits without skipping.

_I guess default's not good enough for you_

Open the menu and go to Config.  Scroll down to the bottom and change the RGB window color settings.

_Destroy Whelk's armored shell_

Whelk is the first boss of the game.  The shell has 50000 HP, whereas the boss has 1600.  Attacking the shell will make it counter with a party-wide attack, but it only has enough MP to do this 6 times.  Heal between attacks until it runs out of MP, then you are mostly safe.  Keep an eye on your HP, while hitting the shell with Tek-Missle and Beams.  You'll need roughly 80 rounds to finish it.

This is the first of 8 hidden elixirs that you will need for [Half-Past Many (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/118692) and [Elixirs of Life (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/118693)

_Steal a MithrilKnife while protecting Terra in the Caves of Narshe_

While defending Terra with the Moogles, use Locke to steal from the boss until you unlock the achievement.  If Locke's party dies, you can finish the boss with one of the other parties.

_Trigger a hidden scene shortly after escaping Figaro Castle_

Two M-Tek Armors will attack you after escaping from Figaro Castle.  Use Fire on one of the enemies and this will unlock at the end of the battle.

**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/223473706-0a5b8018-98ac-4fb1-8cd7-120d5a76f819.png) [To the Horizons (1)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5008)**

_Spending TOO MUCH TIME on the Lete River_

Immediately after the save point in the middle of Lete River, select `Up` at the next branch.  This will send you back to the same branch.  Repeat this several times to unlock this achievement.  Note: This is an easy way to level up characters early on, however, you will miss out on stat bonuses granted by Espers upon leveling up, since you have non-equipped at this time.

**The split scenarios can be done in any order, but consider saving Sabin for last so that you can acquire rages in the other scenarios before your first trip to the Veldt.**

_Negotiate Locke's scenario without stealing any clothes (no guard clipping)_

In order to earn this achievement, do not attempt to steal from any merchants or soldiers.  First, turn your Battle Speed to its slowest (6) in Config.  This will allow you to get two hits on the HeavyArmor in between each of hit rounds.  Equip the Genji Gloves that you earned from rejecting Banon and your best 2 weapons.  Attack the heavy armor located to the left of where you started.  The timing is tight, but you should be able to kill him before he kills you.  Consider using a potion if you get low on health.  After killing him, take a hidden passage behind the building and across the river right behind the enemy.

Head into the cafe and go down the stairs next to the bartender.  Kill (don't steal!) the merchant to take his cider.
Return to the same HeavyArmor and beat him again.  Climb the stairs and offer the cider to the Old Man.  Go down the stairs and give the kid the password: "Courage".  Find the main bedroom in the mansion and go behind the bookcase.  The achievement will unlock before you reach Celes' cell.

_Steal Air Lancet from TunnelArmr, never use Runic, and win in Locke's scenario_

Locke should still be equipped with Genji Gloves and his best weapons.  Heal up using the fountain just before the boss fight.  Make sure you successfully steal the Air Lancet, and then have Locke attack while Celes heals with cure/items.

_Have two Ghosts in your party at once_

Unlocking this achievement requires two party slots for ghosts, which means that Shadow must leave the party if you recruited him.  After the Imperial Base, he has a 1/16 chance to leave after winning a battle.  Once you board the train, he will no longer leave until after the train sequence.  Simply fight enemies until he leaves.  Once you board the train, talk to a ghost to recruit them to your party, leave the room, and come back again to recruit another.

If you have encountered all the enemies in the Rage checklist so far, [Beastlore I (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6423) can be earned on your first trip to the Vedlt.  This could be recommended for LLG runs as Gau's Rages are some of the best abilities to use against bosses.  Remember that Gau will learn Rages from both the encounter he leapt on and the encounter he returned on.  If you accidently hit Gau, he will not learn the rages from that encounter.  See [Beastlord (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5432) for tips on how to optimize learning rages.

[Why So Serious? (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6017)**  
_Cast 7-7-7 Joker Doom_

Now that Setzer has officially joined the team, this achievement can be earned at any time.  Slots are a combination of skill and luck.  Lining up all 7s on the Slot wheel can be difficult to do legitimately.  In fact, the game will change the RNG odds of getting certain combinations if you pause during the slot.  Fortunately, there is a trick that allows use of pause buffering.

At the start of a battle, use an Echo Screen to manipulate the RNG into a state where 7-7-7 is possible even with pausing.  Before any other animations occur (enemy or player), start the Slots on Setzer.  Use pause buffering to line up the slot left slot on the 3rd Chocobo, right before 7 appears. Unpause and quickly press A to get the first 7.  Do the same for the center slot, this time aiming for the 4th Chocobo, right before the 7 appears.  Finally, do the same for the right slot, this time aiming for the 2nd dragon.  If successful, Setzer will cast Joker Doom and unlock this achievement.  If you fail, you will need to start the battle over again to get the right RNG manipulation.

After the cutscene in Narshe, head to the warehouse on the south east side of the town.  You'll encounter Pickpocket who takes the contents of the chest and runs outside.  Follow him outside and up the path that Terra took in the Magitek armor at the beginning of the game.  Once inside, take the east path and continue to chase Pickpocket.  Once you catch up with him, choose to save Mog by talking to him.  You will have other opportunities to obtain a Gold Hairpin later.

Mog learns dances by winning a battle in areas with unique battle background.  Mog may already know Dusk Requiem (Cave) from saving Terra at the beginning of the game.  Grassland, Forest and Desert can all be obtained right around Figaro Castle.  Mt Kolts is a great location to get Mountains and Zozo is great for City.

To learn Water Rondo, Mog must be taken to the Lethe River or Serpent's Trench.  The quicker option is Serpent's Trench.  
* Park the airship outside Crescent Cave on the Veldt
* Go through the cave and learn Water Rondo in the Serpent's Trench
* Do not get on the ship to South Figaro or you will need to go through the Lethe River sequence again
* Hire a Chocobo in Nikeah and ride it to Baron Falls
* Jump off Baron Falls to return to the Veldt and your airship

All Dances can be learned in the WoR EXCEPT Water Rondo, so be sure to get this as early as possible.  The final dance will be learned in the World of Ruin.

Travel to Jidoor on the Western continent near Zozo and the Opera House.  Participate in the auction until Golem is available for purchase.  Outbid the competitors to acquire this magicite.  If you fail to outbid, it will show up in the Auction House again.  
🚩 **Do not purchase both Golem and ZoneSeek (Zona Seeker) in the Auction House.** 🚩  
Purchasing both will lock out [Patron Auctioneer (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6440).  We will get the other magicite later.  Feel free to purchase the Cherub Down (Angel Wings) and Cure Ring (Angel Ring).

Triangle Island is located in the north west corner of the map.  Intangir is invisible and asleep at the start of the fight, so simply run from this fight to add it to the Veldt for now.  Alternatively, you can attempt to beat him at this time as well.  This fight will be available until you move into the World of Ruin at the end of the Floating Continent.

_Defeat Intangir in his homeland, no instant death moves, no dances_

Intangir is the toughest enemy in the World of Balance, but he has some gimmicks that can make this easy with enough patience.  The enemy will start invisible and asleep at the start of battle.  When he is awoken with magic attacks, he will cast Meteo on all party members and promptly go back to sleep.  The good news is that magic against invisible enemies has a 100% hit rate, meaning we can use spells that normally are hard to hit, such as Stop.

The standard method is to learn Stop from Golem and cast it on Intangir to wake him up and immediately prevent his attacks.  Hit him with your best non-elemental abilities (he will absorb all elemental attacks) and try to survive his Meteo attack if stop wears off.  He has 32000 HP, so this can be a long battle.  Using Gau's Rhinox (Destroyer) rage can be helpful as it will cast Life 3 on party memebers, reviving them if they die.  While the boss is asleep, you can heal up your party and repeat.  Keep in mind that the enemy will run away if he has less than 1280 hp when it wakes up.  Stop will keep him from fleeing, but be sure to burst down his remaining health before it wears off.

An easier strategy that can also be used by low level groups involves using Demi and Life 3.  Use the Rhinox (Destroyer) rage to cast Life 3 on a few party members.  Then have a party member cast Demi for a whopping 9999 damage.  Intangir will wake up and kill the party but they will be revived with Life 3.  Repeat this until Demi takes off between 2500 and and 1500 health.  On the next round, instead of casting Demi, cast Stop and burn down the rest of his health with your party.  If successful, he will cast 1 last Meteo before dying.

Remember for the achievement, you cannot use any Dances or instant death moves, including Edgar's chainsaw.

_Have Zombie Cyan escort Terra through 'The Cave to the Sealed Gate'_

Cyan and Terra must be the only party members for this achievement.  It can also help to have Terra learn Vanish to prevent Cyan from hitting her during battle.  Head to the western continent near Figaro Castle.  The desert around Figaro contains FossilFang (Fossil Dragon).  Allow the dragon to hit Cyan with Bone, which will turn him into a zombie.  With this prep complete, head to the Imperial Base on the southern continent and through to the Cave of the Sealed Gate.

As a zombie, Cyan will automatically attack anyone in battle, including Terra.  It may be best to just run away from battles here.  They will still count for the Veldt and you reduce the risk of dying.  You can save inside the cave, but if you die you will need to return to the beginning of the cave in order to make the achievement unlock.  Once you successfully make it to the Esper gate, this achievement will unlock.

_Max out Emperor Gestahl's favor during the banquet_

Prior to entering the Imperial Palace in Vector, equip a party member with SprintShoes for faster movement speed.  After speaking with the emperor, you will have 4 minutes to speak with 24 imperial soldiers.  Start by heading all the way south to the entrance of the palace and then moving around in a clockwise direction.  4 of the soldiers will attack you.  Do not run from these fights, otherwise it will not grant the points you need (even though it counts as having talked to that soldier).  Do not talk to Kefka in his prison unless you have already found all 24 soldiers since it is a lengthy dialogue.

At the banquet, answer with the following options:  
* To our hometowns...
* Leave him in jail...
* That was inexcusable.
* Celes is one of us!
* Next, ask each question once, but do not repeat any questions.  Remember the first question you asked.
> Why'd you start the war?  
> Why do you want peace now?  
> Why'd we have to talk to your men?  
* Yes, the Espers have gone too far.
* Reply with the first question you asked.
* Yes, let's take a break.
* Fight the soldiers near the emperor during the break.  After defeating them, return to your seat.
* That your war's truly over.
* Yes

If you are successful, the achievement will unlock as soon as you gain control of your character.  If it does not, reload your save and try again.

FireEater has 480 MP.  In order to drain MP, Terra or Locke must know Rasp and Osmose, both learned from Shiva.  Start by casting Rasp on the boss to drain large amount of MP.

You will also want roughly 150k GP for an upcoming achievement.  Traveling to the floating continent has some unavoidable exp encounters, so plan accordingly.

⚠️ Before leaving the World of Balance, double check all achievements in this section to see if any have been missed.  
* Make sure Mog knows Water Rondo
* Defeat the Intangir on Triangle Island.
* Find any Veldt encounters that you missed (some may be inaccessible now)

### Floating Continent

⚠️ **Add Locke to your party before heading to the Floating Continent to unlock an upcoming achievement.**

🚩 **Prior to facing AtmaWeapon, make two separate save files at the save point south of the platform that led to the Blackjack.  This will be used for an exclusive achievement based on an upcoming decision.** 🚩

_Steal a Ribbon from and defeat AtmaWeapon, no instant death moves_

Ribbon has a 12.5% chance to be on AtmaWeapon.  If you steal an elixir, reset and try again.  Once you successfully steal the ribbon, kill AtmaWeapon.  If doing a LLG run, it may be easier to spam Rasp on the enemy to drain its MP to zero rather than attempt to bring its HP to zero.

_Earn Shadow's eternal respect_

After you reach the end of the escape sequence, choose to "Wait" instead of jumping onto the airship.  Do not move from the spot as the countdown continues.  Once the countdown reaches 5 seconds remaining, Shadow will appear and this achievement will unlock.  
Note: Saving Shadow is a requirement for several achievements in the WoR.  However, the alternate save you made earlier will be used for [Beyond the Shadows II (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5132), which requires Shadow to be dead.

_Reach the second world_

This achievement will unlock automatically after you complete the World of Balance.

## Step 2: World of Ruin | Total Points: 486

### Solitary Island

⚠️ As soon as you can control Celes, head out to the world map and save your game.  
This next section is timed, so you want to be able to reload if you fail.  Remember to keep a separate save from the Floating Continent for killing Shadow later.

✅**Character 1 out of 14**  
The World of Ruin starts with Celes as your only character.  Other characters will need to be found again.

_A dramatic moment_

If you are unable to save Cid, this achievement will unlock during the following scene.  Do this once for the achievement and then reload your save to attempt the next one.

**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/223576242-e97128fa-77f3-457a-8115-9b3f291815ec.png) [Choose Life (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6280)**  
_A healthy fish diet_

In order to save Cid's life, Celes must continually feed him a diet of health fish.  Cid starts with 120 health which decreases every second.  The goal is to raise his health to 255 before it reaches 0.  Head south from Cid's house to find the fishing area.  The goal is to catch fast moving fish while avoiding the slow moving fish.  Each time you feed a fish to Cid, new fish will appear.

Tips:
* Collect as many fast and medium fish as you can.  Their totals will add up.
* There's no way to know if a medium fish is -4 or +16, but they are worth picking up on average
* If no fish spawn, leave to the world map and return quickly.
* Cid's dialog will change based on his health.
* This can take lots of attempts due to RNG.  Reload if things are not going well.

After saving Cid, return to the fishing spot to get 1 of each fish for your rare items inventory.  Having all 4 is a prerequisite for [So Long and Thanks for All the Fish (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6889).

If several of your members are being hit, consider fighting an enemy to change the amount of GP you have and try again.  Consider adding a Wall Ring to some characters to prevent damage from some of his normal spells.  

Once the fight starts, the only command you can use is Item > Superball.  Each ball can cause anywhere from 256 to 8192 damage, so different attempts may yield different results.  On average, only 7 or 8 should be necessary.  

### Falcon Exploration

⚠️ After finishing Darill's Tomb, the rest of the World of Ruin can be completed in any order.  This guide will focus on just one path, but feel free to explore.  Check each section for any missables or achievements.  

As with the Blackjack, party members can be changed by talking to them on the airship.  The game takes you straight to Maranda, but there are some easy collectibles we can get that will make other sections of the game easier (especially for LLG runs).

🚩 **Run away if you encounter Doom Gaze.** 🚩  
While flying in the Falcon,  you may run into a boss encounter with Doom Gaze.  Do not deal any damage to him until you are ready to kill him in one encounter, otherwise you will be locked out of [N.o...e.s.c.a.p.e...! (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6801).  Smoke Bombs and Warp can be used to flee immediately.

The remaining limited items can now be purchased at the Auction House in Jidoor.  If you purchased Golem in the WoB, 70k GP is needed to purchase the remaining items.  The following items need to be purchased to unlock this achievement:
* Zoneseek Magicite
* Golem Magicite
* Hero's Ring (WoR only)
* Zephyr Cape (WoR only)

As a reminder, the Zephyr Cape will NOT be auctioned if the player has both Zoneseek and Golem.  Only purchase one of these in the WoB and wait to purchase the other until you buy Zephyr Cape in the WoR.

While in Jidoor, stop by Owzer's mansion at the top of town.  Inside the mansion, interact with the painting of flowers to encounter NightShade (Rafflesia).  This is a one time only encounter, but grants Gau his most broken Rage.  It will charm any creature, including bosses, making them attack themselves.  This is very helpful for LLG runs.  Do not continue into the mansion, as you will need to do it solo with Shadow for [I Work Alone (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7128)

After recruiting Mog, interact with the wall behind him to obtain the Moogle Charm (Molulu's Charm).  In the same room, check the western passage to find a treasure chest.  If it was not opened in the WoB, it will contain a Ribbon.  Once both items are acquired, this achievement will unlock.  
Note: The Moogle Charm can only be equipped my Mog, but it prevents all enemy encounters while active.  This is great for LLG runs and the main reason we detoured to Narshe.

✅**Character 7 out of 14**  
Travel to the Veldt with 3 people in the party.  You need at least 5 characters recruited to access the party change screen, which is why Narshe was the first stop.  Winning a battle of the Veldt will have a chance for Gau to join just like he does when learning new rages.

Once again, the Veldt is a great opportunity to learn new magic, earn GP and acquire rages.  Be sure to pick up the Rafflesia Rage to make several upcoming achievements much easier.

Enter the Cave on the Veldt and find Striker (Ichigeki) in one of the chests.  At the end of the Cave, you will fight a Behemoth King and find Shadow.  Shadow will not join your party at this time, but you must rescue him to recruit him later.  Note: After killing the boss, he will reappear in an undead variant.  Use a Fenix Down on him to kill him instantly.

With Gau and Sabin in the party, travel northeast of the Veldt to lone house on the Northern Continent.  Speak with Gau's Father for a scene and an achievement.

### Colosseum

✅**Character 8 out of 14**  
The Colosseum is located in the northwest corner of the map.  Bet the Striker found in the Cave on the Vedlt to battle against Shadow.  Defeating Shadow will add him back into the party.  Shadow is particularly useful as a fighter in the Colosseum since the AI will not use Throw.  If Shadow has no magic, he will only attack.  Even better, he can equip Striker for instant kills on many enemies and has a high base evasion.

It is highly recommended to bet the Czarina Gown (Regal Gown) found in Darill's Tomb to obtain a Minerva for Celes.  This is a fantastic piece of armor that will help greatly with [Minerva Twins (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6887).  The Behemoth Suit can also be bet in exchange for a Snow Muffler (Snow Scarf).  This item is Gau's (and Mog's/Umaro's) best armor and will make him an even more unstoppable force.  Both of the enemies for these exchanges are vulnerable to Striker's instant death ability.

✅**Character 9 out of 14**  
Travel to Maranda and speak with the girl in the house with the carrier pigeons.  Follow the pigeon to Zozo and speak with the man near the Inn to buy a Rust-Rid.  Enter the Pub and use the Rust-Rid on the door outside to reach Mt. Zozo.  At the end of Mt Zozo, you will encounter Cyan who will rejoin your party.

Stepping on a switch in Mt. Zozo will unleash the Storm Dragon.  This dragon uses mostly wind based attacks and is weak to lightning.  Equipping a Thunder Shield and Minerva will help negate a lot of the damage.  Again, if you cannot defeat him now, come back later when you have better equipment.

[Minerva Twins (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6887)**  
_Defeat Phunbaba's final form using only Celes and Terra, no instant death moves_

After obtaining Fenrir, leave Mobliz.  Before returning to Mobliz, adjust the party so that Celes is the only member.  Equipping the Minvera armor will grant high defense and make Celes immune to half of Phunbaba's attacks.  Put Celes in the back row and cast Bio repeatedly.  With luck, he will not use 1000 Needles until Terra shows up, allowing you to beat him even at low levels.

✅**Character 10 out of 14**  
After your battle against Phunbaba, Terra will rejoin the party.

The Phoenix Cave is located in a hole in the mountains north of Tzen.  Land your airship inside to gain access to the dungeon.  Two parties will be required to navigate the dungeon.  For LLG runs, consider putting Mog with the Moogle Charm in one party to avoid fighting.  For the other team, be aware that Phase (Face) will prevent the party from running.  Killing all the Phases will allow the party to run again.

Within the cave, you will encounter the Red Dragon.  It is weak to ice and casts mostly fire based spells.  The party is likely better equipped at this point, but as with the other dragons, this fight is available later if the party is unable to defeat it.

Note: Be sure to pick up the Dragoon Horn in the chest above the Red Dragon.  It will be used later to unlock [Double Dragoon (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7285).

[Patience Pays III (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7284)**  
_Uncurse the Curse Shield_

With Locke in the party, return to Narshe and head to the building north of the relic shop.  In the basement, a man will hand over a Cursed Shield.  This shield will put every status affect on the character that equips it, so be sure to give them a ribbon to counter these affects.  The Cursed Shield will turn into a Paladin Shield by fighting in 256 Magic Point granting battles with it equipped.  The Paladin Shield is the best shield in the game and is key to beating some of the Colosseum bosses.

🚩 **Make a separate save before accepting Ragnarok.** 🚩  

After making a backup save, add Locke to the party and head to the weapon shop in Narshe.  Down the stairs is the shop owner who will offer you Raganrok either as a weapon or as an Esper.

_Win an Illumina at the colosseum_

Illumina is obtained by betting the Ragnarok weapon at the Colosseum.  The opponent, Didalos, uses a variety of spells, but doesn't have have much MP.  Place Mog in the back row equipped with a Flame Shield, Snow Muffler, Ribbon, and Reflect Ring.  This will counter or absorb most of his abilities.  Mog will likely use Dance to start Wind Song, which will deal the remaining damage while also keeping Mog's HP topped off with Sun Beam.  Once you win, this achievement will unlock.

[I Work Alone (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7128)**  
_Have Shadow rescue Relm, alone_

Navigating this dungeon with only Shadow can be tricky, especially while doing a LLG run.  Purchase around 20 Smoke Bombs (300gp each) and 50 Ninja Stars (500gp each) from the item and weapon shop in Thamasa.  Put Shadow in the back row and equip the best armor available.  Recommendations include Genji Helmet, Genji Armor and Thunder Shield.  The shield is particularly useful for the boss.  For relics, equip Shadow with a Memento Ring to counter Doom cast by the boss.  Consider a Zephyr Cape as the other relic to stack Magic evasion and avoid Charm.

Use Smoke Bombs to escape any encounters.  This is faster than running away and will reduce the risk of getting killed.  Using a Smoke Bomb will still add the encounter to the Veldt.  The most dangerous encounter is SoulDancr as they can throw weapons at Shadow, ignoring back row and defense.  On LLG runs, one or two of these is enough to kill Shadow.

The boss uses a combination of thunder element magic, non-elemental attacks, and charm.  The thunder shield will absorb most of the attacks, and heal Shadow too.  The biggest risk is charm.  When it hits, Shadow may hit himself enough times to die before it wears off.  Fortunately, there is a save point before the boss so it is easy to retry.  Once the boss dies, this achievement will unlock.

Note: All other enemies do not appear on the Veldt.

The Tower of Fanatics is unique in that only the Magic ability can be used here.  Using the Moogle Charm to avoid enemy encounters is highly recommended, especially for LLG runs.  There is only one normal enemy that shows up on the Veldt, Magic Urn.  For the bosses, equip Wall/Reflect Rings on the whole party to negate a large number of the attacks.  Keep in mind that cure spells cast on your party will also reflect back to the enemy.

✅**Character 14 out of 14**  
With Relm in the party, travel to the Tower of Fanatics in the center of Serpent's Trench.  Relm will snap Strago out of his delusions and he will join the party.  With Strago back in the party, he can now continue to learn Lores towards [Elder Wisdom (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7157).  To learn a Lore, Strago must be present in battle when the spell is cast.  If done successfully, a message will appear at the end of battle indicating that it was learned.  
Strago starts with 3 Lores to start.  Others may have already been learned in the WoB.

The White Drgn (Holy Dragon) is the easiest of the bunch.  Ensure that all characters are equipped with Wall/Reflect Rings and it will not be able to hit you with its most powerful attacks.  Even better, it will waste turns trying to dispel reflect.  Hit it with your best magic attacks and use Osmose to replenish your MP as needed.

[Psychic Vampires (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7298)**  
_Defeat MagiMaster by draining away his Magic Points_

As with the White Drgn, this is quite simple.  Cast Berserk on the MagiMaster to prevent him from casting spells.  After that, continually cast Rasp to drain the magic points.  When a character runs out, cast Osmose to replenish their MP and go back to rasp.  Normally the boss will cast Ultima as a desperate attack dying, but since he has no MP, it fails!

⚠️ Save the Megaelixir you earn from defeating the MagiMaster to bet it at the colosseum for [The Master Swordsman (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7164)

With Relm and Strago in the party, return the Thamasa for a scene.  The entrance to Ebot's Rock will now be open on the island north of Thamasa.  Collect at least 22 pieces of Coral inside Ebot's Rock and give them to the talking treasure chest to face off against Hidon.  Hidon is the only encounter that can teach Strago GrandTrain.  It will only use it if all the Hidonites are defeated.  Use Life 3 to ensure that it does not wipe the party out

[Step Aside, Gramps! (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7162)**  
_Solo Hidon using only Relm, no instant death moves_

After defeating Hidon normally, respawn him by talking to Gungho repeatedly in Thamasa.  When Gungho mentions that Hidon has returned, return with Relm as the only party member.  Relm should be placed in the back slot and equipped with the best gear (Behemoth Suit in particular) and know Fire 3 and Life 3.  For relics, the Gem Box and Economizer are particularly useful.  If the Economizer isn't available, equip a Ribbon instead.  With this set up, the only major threat is Grand Train, so leave at least 1 Hidonite alive.  Hidon is weak against Fire, so cast Fire 3 repeatedly and replenish MP as needed.  This achievement will unlock when Hidon dies.

Before heading to Doma Castle, three full sets of imp equipment is needed for an upcoming achievement.  The best place to find this equipment is Dinosaur Forest near Gau's Father's house.

While there are other sources for these items, stealing them with Locke/Gogo can be quick and LLG run friendly.  Equip Locke with the Sneak Ring (Thief's Gloves) and set steal as one of Gogo's commands in Status.  Use Phantom or Vanish to make your team invisible and then repeatedly steal from the following enemies for the equipment.  Be sure to save after obtaining each piece of equipment, particularly when facing Tyranosaurs.  Their Meteor attack will pierce through the invisibility and likely wipe the team.  

Three full sets of imp equipment are needed.  
* Imp Halberd (Impartisan) - Stolen from Mantodea (Greater Mantis)
* TortoiseShld (Tortoise Shild) - Stolen from Geckorex (Basilisk)
* Titanium (Saucer) - Stolen from TumbleWeed (Tumbleweed)
* Imp's Armor (Reed Cloak) - Stolen from Tyranosaur (Tyrannosaur)

[Hold Onto Your Butts... (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6798)**  
_Defeat Brachosaur, no instant death moves_

In addition to the Tyranosaurs, the Dinosaur Forest also has Brachosaurs.  These are very powerful enemies that have a rare chance to drop an Economizer (Celestriad), which reduces all MP usage to 1.  They will often start battles by inflicting several status effects on the party, so Ribbons are highly recommended.  Celes and Gogo can use Runic to absorb Ultima.  They are weak to ice and other powerful spells such as Flare and Ultima.  Defeating one without using any instant death moves will unlock this achievement.

_Defeat the Dream Stooges with a party of three imps and full imp gear_

Gather the party and equip them with the imp equipment farmed earlier.  Turn the party into imps using magic and be sure they are put in the front row to ensure they deal more damage than the enemy can heal.  Equip Jewel Rings to prevent Petrify but do not use Ribbons as they will also cure imp.  Curlax (top) should be the primary target as he will revive the other two.  Since the imp armor is so powerful, the trio will hardly deal any damage.  If needed, heal any characters using items such as Potions, Fenix Down, and Soft.  This achievement will unlock as soon as the final enemy is defeated.

[Alone in the Dark (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7197)**  
_Solo Master Pug using only Gau, no instant death moves_

The Master Pug is a monster-in-a-box in the caves leading to the Ancient Castle.  Master Pug hits for massive damage and has some unavoidable attacks such as Step Mine.  Sleep can be used to slow its advance but physical attacks will wake it up.  Its weaknesses will change often, so hit it with non-elemental magic such as Ultima and Flare.  Rages can be too unpredictable and should be avoided.
For LLG runs or an easier solution, using Gau's Rafflesia is also a viable option.  Once charmed, Master Pug will hit himself for 9999 repeatedly until he dies.  Using this method will also unlock [Godhand (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6799).

_Transform Odin into Raiden_

Interact with the Stone Queen beyond the Blue Dragon to transform Odin into Raiden.  Since Odin is replaced, it does not count as a new magicite for [Life, Crystalized (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6618).  Even though Odin teaches the Meteor magic, the final magicite also teaches this at a much faster rate.

### Colosseum & Final Preparations

Most of Strago's Lore can be learned in Kefka's Tower, but there are a few that need to be obtained through other means.  Strago should already know GrandTrain from his fight with Hidon.  Gau can help Strago learn a few others by using the following rages.

Kefka's Tower has a special enemy that uses every Lore ability except 3.  Before going after the final battle, add Strago and Relm to group 2.  Strago will be assigned to a different group later.  Lead group 2 into the tower until you reach an area that looks like a bathroom.  DarkForce (Dark Force) spawns in this area.  They will repeatedly cast Lore abilities until they run out of MP and die (or use Exploder).  Relm can also use Control using the FakeMustache to force it to cast CleanSweep (Tsunami).  This is an excellent opportunity to learn missing lore.  For LLG runs, keep in mind that Strago only learns the rage when the battle is won.  Kill off characters that are close to level 30 before completing the battle to avoid earning exp.

When Strago learns the majority of the Lores, check to see if there is an easier way to get specific lores, such as through Gau's rages or other encounters.  The final lore will be earned further into Kefka's Tower.

Earth Dragon (Opera House)

The Earth Dragon is hiding in the Opera House near Jidoor and Maranda.  It uses earth attacks and is weak to wind and water attacks.  The party is so powerful at this point, they shouldn't have much trouble.

**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/223579165-638e759c-5b1e-465e-8687-e51360e0ab09.png)
[N.o...e.s.c.a.p.e...! (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6801)**  
_Deplete all 55,555 HP from Doom Gaze in one encounter, and obtain Bahamut_

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/226152245-a3b207aa-6177-4c0b-818e-8d7773dd9cfb.png) **Magicite 25 out of 26**  
While flying with the airship, you may encounter a battle with Doom Gaze.  Doom Gaze has a fixed amount of HP that can be chipped away over the course of several encounters.  He will attempt to flee on turn 3 and every turn after, but in order to earn this achievement, you need to deplete all 55k HP in one encounter.  This means that a 4 party team needs to hit him for an average of 7k damage each turn to beat him before he runs.  He is weak to fire and holy, so high level spells such as Fire 3 or Pearl will deal lots of damage.  Ultima is also a powerful option.  Gau's Io Rage can cast Flare Star which will always hit for 9999 damage.

An easier alternative is to use Gau's Rafflesia Rage.  While charmed, Doom Gaze will not attempt to flee and will attack himself repeatedly until all his HP is gone.

The achievement will unlock once you pick up the Bahamut magicite.

[Tetra-Miracle (4)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6861)**  
_Win a pair of Marvel Shoes at the colosseum_

In order to win the Marvel Shoes, first bet an Elixir to fight against a Cactrot.  Equip a Sniper Eye to guarantee a 100% hit rate.  Defeating it will reward a Rename Card.

Bet the Rename Card to fight against the Doom Drgn.  Equip Mog with his best equipment, including a Flame Shield, Snow Muffler and Cure Ring.  The Doom Drgn will put Mog into critical status, but the Cure Ring will give him enough health to withstand a normal attack.  All other attacks will be absorbed or do not deal damage.  Eventually, Mog will defeat the enemy and this achievement will unlock.

[Miao-Miao! (4)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7158)**  
_Win a Cat Hood at the colosseum_

Bet a Imp Halberd (Impartisan) to fight against an Allosaurus.  Be sure to equip a Safety Bit or Memento Ring to avoid instant death from Doom.  This is a normal monster, so it won't be difficult to defeat.

**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/223578586-f88e226f-3b42-4cdf-a6e0-c4094165306d.png)
[Double Dragoon (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7285)**  
_Equip DragoonBoots and Dragon Horns on Edgar and Mog at once_

Only one Dragon Horn can be found in a treasure chest above the Red Dragon in Phoenix Cave.  The other must be earned through the Colosseum.  Bet a Charm Bangle against a Retainer.  Retainers have a special ability that can cause instant death, but it is not blocked by Safety Bits or Memento Rings.  The best option for dealing with it is to bring a character stacked with evasion, such as Shadow.

DragoonBoots can be purchased in Thamasa or Tzen.  Equip both relics on Mog and Edgar to unlock this achievement.

**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/223578809-a374a29f-c1dc-45a2-b8db-016963f1a3ce.png)
[The Master Swordsman (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7164)**  
_Defeat the true Siegfried_

Betting a Megaelixir will initiate a fight against Siegfried, the ultimate boss of the Colosseum.  He has a basic attack and two very powerful magic all of which can deal massive damage.  The quickest way to defeat him is to equip your best physical attack character with the Genji Glove and Offering (Master's Scroll).  This combo will allow them to attack 8 times in a row.  So long as the attacks deal around 5000 damage per hit, Siegfried will die before he has a chance to act.

Alternatively, a more RNG dependent strategy can be used since he is vulnerable to stop.  Equip Shadow with Stunner (Kagenui) which has a 25% chance to cast stop when hitting an enemy.  Use the DragoonBoots and Dragon Horn relics to repeatedly jump.  This will avoid some of Siegfried's attacks while also giving multiple chances to hit him with Stop.  Even with this approach LLG runs are unlikely to deal enough damage, so this achievement should be saved until post-game.

### Kefka's Tower

Upon approaching Kefka's Tower, the party will be split into 3 groups. Each group should have the following characters in order to obtain specific achievements:  
* Group 1 (Left): Must have Strago (Lore)
* Group 2 (Center): Must have Celes (Runic)
* Group 3 (Right): Must have Locke or Gogo (Steal)

Keep in mind that equipment can be traded between all characters, even if they are not in the same group.  If a boss is difficult, consider swapping your best armor from another character.

⚠️ Near the end of the dungeon, the group leaders will step on three switches. Have Group 1 enter and go left. This will ensure that each group goes to the correct boss for the challenge achievements.

_Find the well-hidden Aegis Shield in Kefka's Tower_
An Aegis shield is hidden in Group 3's path, south of the rotating machinery in the Magitek Factory section.  Go around the machinery and take a hidden path south to find it.

[Pro-Runic (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7354)**  
_Use Runic to counter Atma's Ultima_

Group 2 will encounter Atma (Ultima Buster) in a prison area shortly into their section.  After countering 12 attacks, it will start to charge up Ultima.  When this happens, use Runic on Celes.  If Ultima is absorbed successfully, the achievement will unlock.

Group 2 will encounter the Gold Dragon.  It uses lightning based attacks and is weak against water.  As with the other recent dragons, this one is a pushover due to how powerful the party has become.  For extra protection, equip Thunder Shields to absorb most of its attacks.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/226151732-8b92de1b-8723-44c4-9848-a9ffe3174768.png)**Dragon 8 out of 8**  
Group  3 will encounter the Skull Dragon.  It uses poison based attacks and is weak to fire and holy.  Hit it with these types of spells or just stick with Flare and Ultima.  It will go down quickly.

* Storm Dragon - Mt. Zozo
* Ice Dragon - Narshe Battlefield
* Earth Dragon - Opera House
* Holy Dragon - Fanatic's Tower
* Blue Dragon - Ancient Castle
* Red Dragon - Phoenix Cave

Defeating all 8 dragons will grant the Crusader magicite.  If all other magicite have been obtained, this achievement will unlock.  

⚠️ Remember to send Group 1 to the left at the fork when all 3 switches are pressed.

[Goddess of Darkness (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6000)**  
_Steal a Red Jacket from and defeat Poltergeist, no instant death moves_

Group 3 will face off against Poltergeist.  Ensure that Locke/Gogo has the Sneak Ring equipped to double the steal chance.  It is tough to steal and will be even more difficult for LLG runs where Locke is a low level.  Cast Vanish on Poltergeist and have Gogo use the Dischord Lore to halve its level.  This will make stealing much easier.  Once the Red Jacket is successfully stolen, finish off the boss (without using instant death moves) to unlock this achievement.

Group 1 will face off against Doom.  Ensure that Strago is in this group as it is the only opportunity to learn ForceField.  Doom will use this lore when he is under 32k health, so soften him up a little and then hit him repeatedly to get it to trigger.  Once Doom has used ForceField, finish him off (without using instant death moves) to unlock this achievement.

[Elder Wisdom (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7157)**  
_Learn all Lores_

If all previous lore has been learned, this achievement will unlock.  As a reminder, all Lore can be acquired in the WoR.  ForceField is the only missable lore so make sure to bring Strago to that fight by placing him in Group 1 and having that group go left at the switches.  If any are still missing you can leave the dungeon to find them.

_Defeat Goddess, no instant death moves_

No special requirements needed for this boss, except to not use instant death moves.  Goddess will use lots of lightning abilities, so Thunder Shields can help with healing.  The most difficult part of this boss is dealing with Entice which will Charm your characters.

After the three statues, all that is left is the final boss.  The boss is a gauntlet of 4 phases.  If an ally is dead at the end of a phase, they will be replaced with the next person in line.  Make sure the first four characters are best equipped, but also equip the other characters in case someone dies.  Nearly all of the phases have multiple targets, so Ultima is the best approach here.  Keep everyone healthy and beat the game!

### Adding Veldt Encounters

Gau can learn over 250 rages by leaping on monsters encountered on the Veldt.  In order to have a monster spawn on the Veldt, it must first be encountered in battle.  Defeating the enemy or escaping from battle will both add it to the Veldt encounter list.  Since the monsters must be encountered in the world, there are many missable Rages.  To avoid missing a monster, use the checklist provided here to confirm that each monster in an area is encountered: [Gau Rage Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16ophKhgLjYwCdvqEqAsJqVn-XrwLD-GGd2XVsNK8S_A/)

* Check the first column when the party encounters an enemy in the wild
* Check the second column when Gau Leaps or returns to the party during a Veldt encounter with that enemy.
* Check the third column when Gau's Rage list under Skills contains that enemy.

Veldt battles will cycle through a set order of groups which contains several encounters.  The Formation List tab on the checklist shows all of the groups and the encounters they contain.  After earning most rages, it can be helpful to consult this list to know when a missing rage is coming up.

### Encounter Manipulation

Group order is randomized when loading a save game.  Although there is no way to control where the group order will land, resetting can be helpful to get closer to a group that has an encounter with a missing rage.

Groups will increment 1 time after each battle won or escaped on the Veldt.  The specific encounter selected is randomized across all obtained encounters in that group.  For example, if group 1 has all 8 encounters unlocked, there is a 1/8 chance to get a specific encounter.  If only 4 encounters are unlocked, there is a 1/4 chance to get a specific encounter.

Since the specific encounter is randomized, obtaining specific rages can be manipulated using the following steps:  
* Battle until the next group contains a missing Rage
* Save the game
* Start the next encounter.  If it contains the missing rage, have Gau Leap.  If not, die to the encounter.  Remove armor to speed this up.
* The game will automatically load the save game, but the Group will not change.
* Entering a battle immediately will always give the same encounter.  To randomize the encounter, enter a non-Veldt battle.
* Return to the Veldt.  The next encounter will be in the same group, but a new random encounter.
* Repeat these steps as needed.

This approach is time consuming so it best used when down to a handful of missing rages.  

## Step 5: Miscellaneous | Total Points: 45

[Beyond the Shadows II (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5132)**  
_Witness Relm's dream_

Relm's dream requires Shadow to die on the Floating Continent.  Since other WoR achievements require Shadow, make a separate save on the Floating Continent to do this achievement later.  When the party reaches the airship during the escape sequence, immediately jump instead of waiting for Shadow.  The introduction to the WoR will play out the same.  After retrieving the Falcon, travel to the Cave on the Vedlt.  At the end of the cave, Relm will be found instead of Shadow.  Defeat the King Behemoth and witness the scenes in Thamasa.  This achievement will unlock once Relm's finishes her dream.

[Power Level I (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7295)**  
_At least one character has reached level 40_

See [Power Level II (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7297)

[Power Level II (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7297)**  
_At least one character has reached level 99_

The best place to earn exp is Dinosaur Forest.  By the time the party is fully equipped, these fights will become quite easy.  Have the entire party cast Ultima and equip any Economizers to speed things up.  Since only one characters needs to reach 99, equip an Exp Egg on one of them to double their exp.

[Godhand (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6799)**  
_Deal 9,999 base damage in a single attack (Final value may be reduced)_

There are many opportunities to reach this threshold.  This will be earned naturally as the party uses Ultima while leveling to 99.

[Gillionaire (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7200)**  
_Earn 5,000,000 Gp_

Cactrot Desert near Maranda is the best place to earn GP.  Cactrots and Hoovers will both give 10k GP per kill.  Double GP can be obtained by equipping Relm with the Cat Hood (Cat-Ear Hood) won by betting an Imp Halberd (Impartisan) at the Colloseum.  Don't forget that the Veldt will also give GP, so you will earn GP while farming Rages.
