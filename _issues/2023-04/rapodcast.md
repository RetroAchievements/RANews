# Episode 8 - The Magic of The Mystic

{% rauserpic TimeCrush %} sits down with {% rauserpic TheMysticalOne %} as chosen previously in the category "Developer of the Year" to pick his brain on set creation, game choice; and overall community experience. We also dabble on team interactions, as well as get some insight to what the future may hold. 

{% rauserpic TimeCrush %} also welcomes on {% rauserpic BahamutVoid %} in a segment to discuss the recent Console Wars event that has gripped the community with absolute fervor, call our shots despite it's unpredictable nature; and enjoy a brief rundown on his contributions to RA thus far and where we hope to see it down the road.
