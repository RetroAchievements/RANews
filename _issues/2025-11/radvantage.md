| {% raachpic 287014, 325303, Foursome Foe %} | Defeated Vaati at the end of the Hero's Door of Vaati's palace without getting hit. | 25     |


This fight is a 3-phase battle.

Here is a guide for each one of them :

## Phase 1
Vaati will continuously fly toward you on his tornado. Quickly go grab some bomb and while moving in circle to avoid Vaati, throw some explosives in his tornado to hit him. You can then chain bombs until Vaati crash on the floor and then slash him with your sword until death.
You can drop one link in the center at the start in case you get corned by Vaati to be able to switch between them before getting hit.



## Phase 2
Vaati will go in circles around the arena. Go in the same way as him and stay close to the border with both link. When he gets back at the top center, prepare to hit one of his hands.
Pay attention to his hands as when it changes colors, he's going to throw projectiles at you so dodge on the left or the right. After 3 cycles Vaati will get to phase 3.



## Phase 3
Vaati will now move to the center. Hide behind some blocks or the item's pedestal while putting one link on the left border and one on the right, as electric projectiles will go around the arena, but they bounce on any obstacle. Then it's time for the classical tennis match.
The ball will go to the link of the same color, so switch between them until the ball goes hit Vaati. If he moves at the same time, you can still hit again the ball to adjust its trajectory, no need to aim though as it will always automatically aim Vaati last position. Always stays on the borders and you should be safe. When he goes back to the center, go hide as he's going to throw electric projectiles again. You should be good after 4 ball hits.
