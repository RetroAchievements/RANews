## RA Awards

The 5th annual RA Awards has started. The RA Awards are the community's opportunity to highlight their favorite sets, developers, contributors, and community members from the prior year. Check out the `# rawards-discussion` and `#rawards-voting` channels in Discord for more details.

## Hash Compatibility Testing

The QA-team is happy to announce a new process for hash compatibility testing! This allows users to help test hash compatibility for existing sets. You can work with the developer on testing new hashes while mastering the set to verify compatibility. Below are some of the recently linked hashes. 

| Game                                                         | Console            | Hash Type              | Tester                       | Link Date    |

## PlayTester Revamp

The PlayTester team has been revamped in order to expand the team and its current capabilities. Playtest requests can be submitted and discussed via Discord in the new forum channel.

Reach out to {% rauserpic TimeCrush %} for more information.

## Cheat Investigation

We've started an official cheat team and created the dedicated account {% rauserpic RACheats %}.

If you suspect anyone may be cheating or see suspicious scores/times, you can send a DM to that account and the team will look into it.

## Site Updates

### RAWeb 2025.10.07
**New Features**
- Desktop users can now see the first 5 leaderboards in the sidebar. This covers all leaderboards for 55% of the games in the database.
- Games that have photosensitive epilepsy content warnings now display them directly on the page.
- Hubs hidden behind the "See More" button have had some UX tweaks to make major improvements to readability.
- The Reset Progress UX has been revised so it's less of a risky click.

We're still working on a handful of adjustments based on user feedback we continue to receive. We're still aware of a few known issues (such as missing links to developer tools) and expect these things to be resolved in subsequent patches.

Please keep the feedback coming so we can keep improving the page.

[Full release notes here](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/releases/tag/2025.10.07)

### RAWeb 2025.10.19
**New Features**
- Set rarity now appears on the beta game page.
- You can now search for ".hack" and get relevant results.
- Our annual recap email now has a much-improved look & feel.
- Event achievements can now be assigned point tiers of 25, 50, and 100 (note: these don't affect your overall hardcore points on the site).

[Full release notes here](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/releases/tag/2025.10.19)

### RAWeb 2025.10.23
**Highlights**

- Developers: we've added a bunch of links for missing developer tools such as claims history.

[Full release notes here](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/releases/tag/2025.10.23)

### RAWeb 2025.10.30
**Highlights**

- We've made one final hub visibility tweak on the beta game page.
- Three or four more reported bugs on the beta game page have been fixed.
- @Scott has rejoined the engineering team as a contributor, fixing a bug on the user profile page with his first merged PR in several years.
