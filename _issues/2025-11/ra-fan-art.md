Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

The coming few issues, we will be dedicating to the holidays art we received, starting with Kirby having swallowed Santa Claus to have the Santa ability! No, he did not just get a hat, he swallowed Santa. This is canon.

Meanwhile Sonic is not enjoying the holidays, as it looks like Sonic.exe has broken the game barrier again and is now on the hunt. But hey at least it's snowy!

Banjo and Kazooie received a present for Christmas! Big box, what could it be... oh. All this effort and all they got was a lousy PNG. Well hey on the bright side, that's another set request!

If there is one game commonly associated with Christmas while maybe not looking like it to outsiders, it's Parasite Eve. So, wizagab solved that! Just give Eve a santa hat and there we go!

And another Christmas game is Batman Returns... but it looks like tobesplays wasn't a big fan of it! So much so they they grabbed multiple copies, doused them in gas and ready to erase them from existence.

What would Christmas be without the movies that are on TV every year that we definitely haven't seen enough? Polar Express is one of them, that also has a GBA video game adaptation with a kid never part of the movie that goes super saiyan. Funny moment in video game history.

And back to Parasite Eve we go, with gameburke doing a redrawing of the cover art! Yeah probably doesn't scream Christmas anymore now does it, but it is!

And finally, we have Donald asking the real questions... why was Sora on the badge? He can't keep getting away with stealing the spotlight where he doesn't belong... but oh well, at least the badge is nice!
