## Elemental Gimmick Gear (Dreamcast)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Console   | Genre                                                |

The Dreamcast has plenty of great, overlooked games, but as far as I'm concerned, Elemental Gimmick Gear is the one to beat. Originally meant to be a Sega Saturn game, EGG feels like a proper bridging of two console generations; much of the game uses lovely 2D visuals mixed with pre-rendered backgrounds, but when going up against certain bosses, things shift to a full 3D battle system. It's an unusual concoction, but it's also one of the most breathtakingly gorgeous and alluringly mysterious games I've ever played.

If you enjoy [Zelda](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7438)-like games on Sega platforms, such as [Landstalker](https://retroachievements.org/game/561), [Crusader of Centy](https://retroachievements.org/game/1438), [Shining Wisdom](https://retroachievements.org/game/14544), and [Beyond Oasis](https://retroachievements.org/game/143) (and its [sequel](https://retroachievements.org/game/14542)), you're gonna love this one. You play as an amnesiac pilot of an egg-shaped robot found inside a ruin called Fogna. Naturally, figuring out who you are is of the utmost importance, and to get answers, you have to dig real deep into Fogna. Similarly to how [Phantom Hourglass](https://retroachievements.org/game/14323) would revolve around a central dungeon years later, you have to explore the ominous depths of Fogna, make progress until something stops you, then go back out into the rest of the world and find a different dungeon that gives you a new ability. It's a compelling gameplay loop that gets you exploring and learning all about the world, which is great because EGG has an incredibly interesting world.

Early on, you're introduced to a variety of characters, ranging from fellow EGG pilots to a group of pirates that serve as the initial narrative thrust so you're not just wandering around. Pursuing the main threads exclusively exposes you to incredible environments that feel like a mixture of natural beauty and mechanical monstrosities, but it's the number of side quests you can do and the people you interact with that instill Elemental Gimmick Gear with its weird, playful personality. They also lead into opportunities for good achievement ideas!

One of the earliest things you can do is spar against a rival EGG pilot. You'd normally think to just do this once and move on, but if something possesses you to beat him 100 times, you'll get an extremely powerful upgrade! Another fun quest has you answering questions asked by an old man who's a bit wacky. You'll be expected to listen to absurd stories that he may or may not have made up, know specific trivia, and even do some math, nothing of which has anything to do with the rest of the game! Even the more standard kinds of quests like helping people for the sake of it or digging around for permanent upgrades are rewarding in their own ways. This is a game that gets better and better the more you explore and soak it all in.

There are plenty of great looking games out there, but Elemental Gimmick Gear stands tall in my mind as one of the most artistically inspired out there. It's charming, evocative, mysterious, and strange in ways that other video games rarely match. As a Zelda-like, it's also just dang fun to play with challenging combat, loads of variety, and smart dungeon design that never outstays its welcome. Whenever people ask around for Dreamcast games that aren't the most well-known hits, this is always the game I recommend first. Anyone interested in exploring the depths of what the Dreamcast had to offer owes it to themselves to play EGG and I hope an achievement set that pushes players to savor every last drop of it happens someday.

## \~Hack~ Pokémon Chileno (Game Boy Advance)

What can I say, this romhack of [Pokémon FRLG](https://retroachievements.org/game/515) is made with several references to my country. When it was added to the site it was still a prototype, however, the game is already done and ready for a set. If you're a Spanish speaking dev, this hack will be a very interesting challenge, as it goes on chapters, it has several Easter eggs related to the Chilean culture, and even some fakemons to spice things up on a “gotta catch ‘em all” achievement. The game is the average hack experience, so it won't be difficult to work with, and all the Chilean members of RA will have eternal gratitude to the dev that makes a set of this hack.

## WWE WrestleMania XIX (GameCube)

This is the wrestling game that I grew up on. I was too young to get in on the [AKI](https://retroachievements.org/hub/23012) games on the N64 back when they were the big thing, but I was a pretty big fan of this game, even though I was not actually into wrestling back then. This game introduced me to a lot of superstars that I still admire today, like the Undertaker and Kurt Angle. It's a pretty good game overall; it does not have the arcadiness of the N64 games, but is not as pure simulation as the modern games are.
 
As far as achievements go, it actually has a decent depth in it with the single-player mode. It's not as deep as the "franchise" modes from the PS2 games, but it does have variety in there as well as a good amount of accessible levels that could have pretty good challenges there. Could also have some specific matches/moments recreated in the game.

## Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 (PlayStation 2)

To be blunt, there are a LOT of [DDR](https://retroachievements.org/hub/4672) games out there, and many of them have achievement sets on RA already. Some basic, some creative, a lot of them high scoring. Yet out of all of them, Extreme 2 is not one of them. But if it hasn’t been said before, let me say it now: Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 NEEDS a set. It needs a set because it is quite possibly the best version of DDR on the PS2, period (at least in North America).

The game is 74 songs strong, so many of them favorites from across the franchise. Fan favorite licenses like Butterfly (Upswing Mix), Captain Jack (Grandale Mix), Cartoon Heroes, and Irristiblement are included, and excellent newcomers like As the Rush Comes and Silence debut here. It has the Karaoke Revolution crossover songs that DON’T suck. There are very few Konami Original repeats compared to previous games, and most of them have their MAX2 remixes. Tons of favorites from [Extreme Japan](https://retroachievements.org/game/20547) made the cut, several Ultramix debuts find their way in, and even more original tracks make their debuts. Add a small sampling of extra IIDX crossovers, and the music list becomes unparalleled.

In terms of possible achievements to include, the sky is the limit. There are TONS of gameplay modes to pick from. Song courses can be played with either Nonstop or Challenge rules, and both modes can adjust difficulty. There are new Endless variants: one that gives you three misses, and one that gives you NO misses. And Dance Master Mode? My GOD, Dance Master Mode. 192 missions across a gigantic map that test your dance skills, from Beginner to Expert. Not to mention the opportunity for creative achievements for individual songs or feats. One look at the [Supernova](https://retroachievements.org/game/20446) sets can give you ideas for those.

Long story short, we NEED achievements for Extreme 2. It’s probably the biggest missed opportunity on RA so far, and whoever rectifies it will have my utmost respect.

## Rampage Through Time (PlayStation)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Console     | Genre  |

I feel like everyone has that one game in a franchise that they love that other people judge. For me, that's Rampage Through Time. Taking similar gameplay from [Rampage 2: Universal Tour](https://retroachievements.org/game/10329), Rampage Through Time has you running around as the monster of your choice, destroying buildings, kicking cars, and eating everything you can get your hands on. In each set of levels, you'll find yourself being sent to different periods of time, changing both the architecture and projectiles trying to hit you. It's an enjoyable loop, with maybe a divisive flaw or two. For one thing, you have to compete with two other monsters here, making it more of a PvP experience in some regards. The other big change that was added is the minigames. Unlike the older bonus stages, after each time period, you'll have to play a minigame based on that era to advance. My personal favorite of these is the Medieval era's Castle Crush. It plays like Atari's Warlords. Others include games like [Snake](https://retroachievements.org/hub/9604), block pushers, and various dog fighting games in both ships and planes. They're an enjoyable showcase of [Midway](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8676)'s arcade roots.

It would be amazing to get this set to complete [Rampage](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8904)'s fifth generation era of games. I really do think more people should see the interesting ideas this game had before Rampage: Total Destruction decided to try out a different art style and mechanical movements entirely. Please consider checking it out if you're only familiar with the Arcade and N64 releases! I promise it'll be worth your while.

## One Piece: Chopper no Daibouken (WonderSwan)

It's a hard ask to request an as of yet untranslated roguelike dungeon crawler to be granted an achievement set, but amongst the majority of anime games locked behind the doors to the Land of the Rising Sun, this one is by far my most desired game of all.

You take the role of Chopper, the mascot and doctor of the Going Merry, as the Straw Hats arrive on a mysterious island, where suddenly, overnight, they transform into a variety of animals while Chopper remains unchanged. Now being the most capable crew member at this point, it's up to Chopper to explore the island and find a way to change his friends back to their human forms.

The neat thing about this game is, as I mentioned, the major bulk of the gameplay sees you going through a series of procedurally generated mazes and combating the various enemies within. Think [Shiren the Wanderer](https://retroachievements.org/game/9817) or [Pokémon Mystery Dungeon](https://retroachievements.org/game/2816). You can even bring your crew members along to help you fight, as well as participate in various minigames for rewards. It's also fairly tame in its difficulty, and despite the language barrier, you should still be able to figure it out for the most part.

I genuinely just think this one is neat, and I straight up think the animal designs on the Straw Hats are cool, especially Zoro and Robin. Definitely a game that I would be very interested in giving a try, should it get a set, and I'm sure plenty of other people feel the same.

When I was a kid, I had quite a few [Humongous Entertainment](https://retroachievements.org/hub/9255) games on PC, and played all of them many times over. What I didn't know until much later was that some of them were also on the 3DO (heck, I didn't know the 3DO existed then either!)...Although oddly enough, it was mostly titles I didn't have. That is, except for one: Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon. Now, this wasn't my favorite HE game (I was more about [Pajama Sam](https://retroachievements.org/game/19914) or Spy Fox), but I still remember going through this one a lot.

Like most HE games of note, this is a children's point-and-click, with tons of things to interact with for no reason beyond "seeing what happens". As for your (Putt-Putt's) main objective, you've found yourself stranded on the moon, and need to get back home...By collecting pieces of a rocket, including one currently being used by locals as an ice cream shop. Yes, there are aliens on the moon (don't give me that look, you're a talking car, and considered normal! Realism is not an intended goal here). There's also a few minigames here and there, if you're not quite ready to leave by the time you've got all the rocket parts. No 100% collectibles sadly, but hey, it's good material for non-progression cheevs, right?

All in all, this is quite the charming little game, and while you likely won't be challenged, it's sure to bring a smile to your face. And isn't that what gaming's about?

## Aero Fighters 3 (Neo Geo CD)

The [Aero Fighters](https://retroachievements.org/hub/23031) trilogy (a.k.a. Sonic Wings in Japan) are a set of 90's arcade shoot ‘em ups developed by Video System that all share the same basic premise: alien forces have mobilized mechanical attackers to invade Earth, and you must choose from a selection of oddball ace pilots who each have access to different weaponry in order to obliterate the enemy's planes, tanks, battleships, robot walkers, mechanized famous landmarks, and so on. Aero Fighters 3 wraps up the trilogy's story arc by revealing that the aliens have discovered dimension-shifting technology that allows them to teleport, wiping out most of Earth's ability to resist within days; the only hope is to counterattack their central command base on Mars and destroy their leader before it fires a weapon that will wipe out all life on Earth.
Aero Fighters 3 ups the number of selectable pilots to 12 (10 visible by default, 2 secret) from the previous game's 8 options. The gameplay follows a two-loop-style system: a playthrough will go through 5 normal stages and 2 bonus stages before ending up at the final boss stage on Mars; if you beat that, your reward is a character-specific ending cutscene followed by entering a harder version of Stage 1. If you can make it through 16 total stages of remixed boss patterns and increasingly frantic attacks, only then do you get to see the credits roll. On top of the large number of available weapon types, all of the stages except the first one have at least two possible routes with different bosses. Even if you're a bullet-dodging prodigy, you'll have to put some time into this one to conquer all the route branches and get good with all the weapon variants. This seems like a set that could be intimidating but very rewarding, and hopefully the trilogy will be complete on RA soon.

Wild Card is a, well, wild experiment of a game. Created by the man behind the [SaGa](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7905) series (a franchise no stranger to trying unusual game mechanics), Wild Card is a card-based RPG, leaning heavily into "card-based" (but we'll get to that in a bit). It most closely resembles nonlinear RPGs such as [Legend of Mana](https://retroachievements.org/game/11288) or the aforementioned SaGa series mixed with a dungeon crawler. You choose one of a handful of potential protagonists and set off on your adventure. You'll visit and explore towns, meet new possible allies, explore new locations and, of course, battle an array of monsters.

Sounds fairly typical so far? Let's revisit the "card-based" part. Everything you do in this game is controlled by cards...and I mean everything. What location you visit, where you'll go and what you'll do in town, how you traverse terrain, what you can do in combat, how you pay for items...all that and more is done via cards. Gorgeously illustrated cards to boot, from an art team led by Akihiko Yoshida, of [Final Fantasy Tactics](https://retroachievements.org/game/11246) and [Ogre Tactics](https://retroachievements.org/hub/10856) fame. Depending on your feelings toward card systems and exploratory game mechanics, the thought of this may have you extremely intrigued or ready to dismiss the game at hand. It may even make you think of SaGa Unlimited, a game that featured a similar card system.

Personally, I love to explore games with weird, whacky, or just "out there" game mechanics, and a game like Wild Card sounds perfect for a set to help someone really dig in and explore everything Wild Card has to offer. Sadly, Wild Card is a text-heavy game exclusively in Japanese, which could be a big stumbling block for those not fluent in the language. Thankfully, there is help! While not a full in-game translation patch, a dedicated fan has done [extensive work](https://usaganotes.wordpress.com/secret-adventure/wild-card/) documenting and translating every card, character, and other piece of content in the game - a perfect resource for players and possible devs alike!

I had the chance to play the [PSX port](https://retroachievements.org/game2/11409) of the first [Gex](https://retroachievements.org/hub/3216) game for the [E3 AOTW event](https://retroachievements.org/forums/topic/31070). It is such a strange game where the game gets easier past the first world, until the last world spikes the difficulty again. Part of the reason why that version is so hard is that its save system relies on passwords, and you need to find a tape first in a select amount of levels before it shows you after beating the level. This means that if you beat a hard level, don’t get a password, and then game over on the next level, you need to go back and do it over again.

This was only an issue with the ports, but the 3DO original had a regular save system. So I was surprised to see that the original version of the game never got a set, even though it is the definitive version of the game. I wish it had a set so it would be accessible for people to check out a really charming, though challenging 2D platformer. Featuring great graphics and a weird and one-of-a-kind setting of levels taking place in different genres of TV and movies, with the bosses being a troupe from each world.

This was the system seller for the 3DO and one of, if not the, best games on the console, and has Gex use some extremely unique abilities that you didn’t really see in any other 2D platformers from the era, like climbing on walls, the ceiling, and even the background. All this is even more impressive when you realize that they made all of it in under 2 years for a new state-of-the-art console.

The final boss can also be annoying to do damageless, but it’s worth it to see the ending where the game sarcastically congratulates you, and then roasts you for spending the time to beat the game for 10 minutes before becoming weirdly inspirational.
