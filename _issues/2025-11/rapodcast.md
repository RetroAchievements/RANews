# Episode 28 - Community Engagement

It's no secret that RA continues to grow each and every day, seeing alongside each new console release, an influx of fresh faces. Beyond that, talks of multi-set, the streamlining of Events, and otherwise more user friendly features; we can only expect that registered user number to continue to escalate. 

A growing play-base however can often lose its way, and requires guidance alongside a cohesive nature in order to remain true to what the community was originally intended to be: A place for all looking to have a fresh take on a nostalgic good time. 

For exactly that reason, I have my returning guest here tonight, {% rauser Nepiki %}, to discuss their recent promotion to community manager, and what that looks like behind the scenes - On an episode I'm calling !Topic: True Blue Community Management
