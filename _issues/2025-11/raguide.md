**Welcome to DYNASTY WARRIORS 5!** 

If you’re reading this guide, it means you’re probably mad enough to take on the challenge of mastering this set. Like every other game in the **_Musou_** genre, this is a _very_ grindy and difficult game and the mastery will easily take you hundreds of hours, as you can probably tell by the fact that *less than 0.1%* of players have actually achieved it. Not to worry though, as this guide aims to put all of the achievement info in one easily accessible place, as well as providing advice.

<h2 id=Preparation> Preparation: Game Setup + Leveling + Item and Weapon Grinding + Bodyguards</h2>


<sub>(If you’re already experienced with this game, you can skip this section.)</sub><br>
———<br>

**Game Setup**<br>

———<br>
If you’re playing on PC I **highly recommend** selecting your copy of Xtreme Legends and enabling the PCSX2 patch that unhides the Musou and Free Modes (right click the ROM > properties > patches in the ROM loader). This creates a ‘complete’ version of the game with everything needed to achieve 100%. 

The ‘Load Original’ function, intended to copy over your save data from the original DW5 to XL, **does not work on emulators** without a *lot* of troubleshooting. The easiest way to transfer data is a one-time direct copy from your memory card upon loading a fresh XL without any prior save data.

If your copy of XL has save data on it and you want to make it fresh, go to System > Boot BIOS on the PCSX2 loader. This will emulate the PS2 BIOS screen where you can access your memory card data, and then you can find and delete the XL data. Alternatively, use MyMC. I highly recommend this if you already have data on your base DW5 copy and you don’t want to level the characters all over again.<br>
———<br>

**Leveling**<br>

———<br>

Speaking of leveling, you’re going to be doing a lot of it. There are a whopping 48 playable characters in DW5, and you will need to get *all* of them to max level for the best chance at clearing their Musou Mode on Chaos. This is because their level (or rank as the game calls it) determines how many items they can equip in a stage, with max rank allowing them up to 5, plus a harness and an orb.

The way leveling works in this game is that you earn points at the end of a stage based on how many KOs you got and how many officers you defeated. There are no difficulty multipliers, so it’s best to grind ranks on Novice/Easy because it’s faster. You can earn up to a maximum of 9,999 points in a stage, and each character needs a total of 60,000 points to get to max rank.

Once you’ve taken your characters through their Musou Modes on Easy to get weapons and early ranks, my personal method to grind out the rest of the points is to play the **Battle of Chen Cang (Shu Forces)** with the **Storm Harness** equipped. There are a truckload of enemies and officers in this stage and it’s very easy to grind out additional KOs at the northern castle checkpoints to get 1,000+ KOs every run. Equip the **Serpent Earrings** and **Naga Earrings** while you’re doing this so you can grind out stats at the same time. You can see how to get these items in the Special Items section.

_(XL Only: Upon clearing stages you’ll also get power-ups for a specific stat. These are one-time use items that you can use on any character in the Camp menu to slightly increase a specific stat. Use these on characters you don’t like playing as much. You can also get power-ups for weapons to increase their power and attributes, but these don’t work on 4th weapons, so they’re not as important.)_<br>
———<br>

**Item and Weapon Grinding**<br>

———<br>

In addition to the special items, there are common items that you can find in crates and dropped by specific officers around each stage. The item you get from each drop is random and they boost a specific stat for the character when equipped. They go up to a maximum of +20.

In order to get higher levelled items you need to clear stages on harder difficulties and also on high difficulty stages. You can see a stage’s difficulty in Free Mode when choosing which side to play on. Stage difficulties go up to 5, they determine how much HP enemies have and how powerful they are.

Right next to item crates are weapon crates, which will drop a weapon specific to the character you’re playing. You’ll want to try and get a 6-hit weapon for each character to unlock their full moveset. 

Weapons can be Light, Medium, or Heavy weight. Light weapons have increased attack speed in exchange for less attack power, while Heavy weapons are the opposite. **Never use a weapon with Heavy.** The increased power isn’t at all worth the slower attacks, especially since enemies in this game attack fast and love to use the guard stance.

For quick item and weapon upgrades to start out, **Guan Yu’s Escape** on the Wei side is a very short stage with 4 item and weapon crates along a linear path. This is also a good stage to grind out a character’s Life stat since Zhou Cang always drops a Dim Sum.

For grinding maxed out items, play **Conquest of Nan Zhong** on the Nanman side on Hard difficulty, with luck-boosting items like the **Hex Mark Harness** and **Seven Star Sash.** There are item crates in the poison swamp, in the hidden path in the middle of the stage, at the southwestern base, and in the juggernaut area. You also get an extra item for killing Ma Chao.

While playing through Musou Mode, always make sure you get items and weapons. Stages in Musou Mode will scale in difficulty the further you go and this affects weapons and item levels. You can get nearly maxed out items and powerful 6-hit weapons on a character’s final stage just on Normal difficulty.

Using a bodyguard with the ‘Item’ and ‘Find’ abilities will give you 1 extra item and weapon respectively at the end of the stage.<br>
———<br>

**Bodyguards**<br>

———<br>

Bodyguards in this game are companions that fight with you, and you have a chance of obtaining them when completing a stage. You can only have one in a stage unlike previous games, but they can be a very helpful ally if you know what to look for. There are also a few achievements specific to bodyguards, so it helps to get familiar with them.

Bodyguards are composed of weapon type, trait, letter grade, element, and several abilities that can affect gameplay. **Spear** and **Sword** are melee users, **Bow**, **Crossbow**, and **Staff** attack from a range, and **Fan** is melee that can also heal you. Traits and letter grades affect their stat growth. Elements augment their attacks with special effects, which you can learn more about in the Orb section of Special Items.

To keep things simple, you only want bodyguards with either the **Brilliant** or **Superior** traits. This is because bodyguards have limited stat growth since they only gain stats via levelling up, and once they reach level 6, they are stuck with their final stats and abilities permanently. Brilliant bodyguards ensure that they will have high stats at the end of their levelling process. Superior bodyguards will almost always have maxed out stats regardless of their letter grade and have a chance of getting 4 abilities instead of the usual 3, but they are *much* rarer, so it may take a long time before you even see one.

Explaining abilities, ‘Item’ and ‘Find’ are useful for item grinding as mentioned above. ‘Hire’ will ensure you always get a new bodyguard at the end of a stage, which you can use with a very short stage to quickly farm bodyguards. ‘Fame’ makes it easier to raise ally morale via enemy KOs. ‘Rage’ and ‘Wall’ buffs the bodyguard’s Attack and Defense respectively when they’re knocked down. ‘Heal’ allows them to heal themselves, and ‘Link’ allows you and your bodyguard to do a True Musou combo when you’re connected with a blue line.

**Your highest priority is to get a Fan bodyguard with the Superior trait**, since they are one of a few sources of healing you can have on Chaos difficulty and are immensely helpful. You’ll also want a good Sword bodyguard for a specific achievement at some point.<br>




<h2 id=SpecialItems> I: Special Items</h2><br>

(*In Xtreme Legends, Legend Mode introduces new stages that include alternative conditions for unlocking some special items. I will include them alongside the base game conditions as just a footnote, since all of them are pretty simple.*

Be aware that you are **NOT** automatically given the item upon fulfilling the conditions. When you fulfil them, a crate will spawn in the stage, which you must then collect and then finish the stage in order to register. You can check exactly where the crate spawned by using the Battle Log.)<br>

### Harnesses<br> (Obtainable on all difficulties)<br>

———<br>

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Red Hare Harness" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/427272.png" /><br>
_**Red Hare Harness**_
* **Effect:** Start the stage mounted on Red Hare; the fastest mount in the game
* **Stage:** Battle of Chang Shan (Yuan Shao’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei all within a minute of each other.<br>

**Notes:** All three of them are located within the main enemy camp and fairly spaced apart from each other. Use Unit Info to keep track of where they are. It’s highly advised to kill Liu Bei last, as his brothers are his sub-officers, and they will flee the stage and be unable to be tracked if they’re not dealt with first.<br>

———<br>

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Hex Mark Harness" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/427273.png" /><br>
***Hex Mark Harness***
* **Effect:** Start the stage mounted on Hex Mark; increases the Luck stat
* **Stage:** Battle of Cheng Du (Liu Bei’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Zhang Ren within a minute of his ambush unit spawning. Pang Tong must be alive.<br>

**Notes:** Zhang Ren is located at the northwestern corner of the stage and will spawn the ambush unit once you approach him from either side. Note that *you* have to be the one to approach him. If you take too long, Pang Tong will approach him instead and immediately die to the ambush. Alternatively you can just play as Pang Tong to ignore this setback entirely.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Storm Harness" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/427274.png" /><br>
***Storm Harness***
* **Effect:** Start the stage mounted on Storm Runner; grants a 1.5x multiplier to points earned at the end of a stage
* **Stage:** Battle of Guan Du (Cao Cao’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Yan Liang and Wen Chou in the first five minutes of the stage.<br>

**Notes:** It’s best to play as Guan Yu for this, since you personally have to be the one to deal the killing blow to both of them, and NPC Guan Yu will immediately kill both of them if he approaches them.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Shadow Harness" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/284fbe4a-68ac-4b8e-9592-4e04b2deb4d8" /><br>
***Shadow Harness***
* **Effect:** Start the stage mounted on Shadow Runner; unable to be knocked off mounts by enemies, hazards, or projectiles
* **Stage:** Battle of Liang Province (Allied Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Zhang Ji and Hu Zhen within 45 seconds after their arrival.<br>

**Notes:** Both of them will spawn once Dong Zhuo enters the stage and calls for reinforcements. They will spawn at the northeastern and southwestern bases and head towards the center of the stage. Camp in one of the bases so you can immediately kill one of them and use Red Hare to quickly get to the other officer.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Elephant Harness" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40686644-a98e-4165-96d6-ae348a0e30ac" /><br>
***Elephant Harness***
* **Effect:** Start the stage mounted on a Nanman elephant; it’s an elephant
* **Stage:** Battle of Nan Zhong (Nanman Forces)
* **Conditions:** Rescue Wu Tugu, King Mulu, and King Duosi without letting any enemy officers enter your main camp.<br>

**Notes:** Rescue them by defeating the enemy officers attacking them. Your allies will have no problem holding down the fort so you shouldn’t have any problem getting this unless you really screw up.

———<br>

### Orbs<br> (Only obtainable on Hard and Chaos)<br>

———<br>

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Fire Orb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60f48f78-7fef-425f-9a4d-d0a04b8e5c0b" /><br>
***Fire Orb***
* **Effect:** Augments your charge attacks with Fire; reduces enemy HP at a continuous rate while they’re stunned or in the air
* **Stage:** Battle of Si Shui Gate (Allied Forces)
* **Conditions:** Get 200 KOs within the first 2 minutes of the stage.<br>

**Notes:** Packs of enemies are much denser on Hard and Chaos than on other difficulties, so just pick a character with good AoE coverage and go wild. Move towards the center of the stage, that’s where the majority of the enemies are.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Ice Orb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52ebf47b-4eed-46cf-a1f8-fac8b2bca346" /><br>
***Ice Orb***
* **Effect:** Augments your charge attacks with Ice; has a chance to freeze the enemy, making them unable to do anything for a few seconds
* **Stage:** Battle of Guan Du (Yuan Shao’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Cao Pi within the first 4 minutes of the stage.<br>

**Notes:** Cao Pi is positioned right outside the main gate of the enemy camp and will be surrounded by soldiers and other officers. Thankfully they’ll all be pretty easy to deal with since this is only a 1-star difficulty stage. You can make it even easier by playing the Musou Mode of somebody whose first stage is Yuan Shao’s Guan Du, like Zhenji and Zhang He.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Shadow Orb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac484e25-7f4b-4cae-8b05-afae0a90fb5f" /><br>
***Shadow Orb***
* **Effect:** Augments your charge attacks with Dark; has a chance to instantly kill soldiers and deal fixed damage to officers, at the cost of a portion of the Musou gauge
* **Stage:** Battle of Wu Zhang Plains (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defy the Heavens and defeat Jiang Wei before Zhuge Liang dies of his illness.<br>

**Notes:** One of the toughest items in the game to get. You have a time limit of around 10 minutes before Zhuge Liang dies, so you only really have time to do 1 or 2 of the stage objectives before having to rush down to the enemy camp.

Actually defeating Jiang Wei is one thing. He’ll be right next to Zhuge Liang and will also be surrounded by Yueying and her extremely annoying juggernaut units, not to mention the absolute swarms of soldiers you also have to deal with.

But then you also have to escape from the camp afterwards to go pick up the item, which is *very* out of the way, and meanwhile after you’ve done all that, your army is probably at a massive disadvantage because you’ve ignored critical objectives, so the safest way to complete the stage is to go back in and finish the job. Oh right, Zhuge Liang conveniently gets over his illness when Jiang Wei dies, so you can’t just wait it out, as funny as that would be.

Honestly, just ignore this item until you get a powerful maxed out character, or play as Cao Pi or Sima Yi to make yourself the commander. It’ll make your life a lot easier. The Shadow Orb isn’t even good in this game. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Light Orb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f66f443-6bd6-409f-ad89-33c0120f4360" /><br>
***Light Orb***
* **Effect:** Augments your charge attacks with Light; hits through an enemy’s guard and stuns them
* **Stage:** Battle of Wu Zhang Plains (Shu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Xu Zhu, Cao Ren, and Zhenji within the first 5 minutes of the stage.<br>

**Notes:**  Immediately go through one of the northern supply camps and start hunting them down. I recommend the westernmost one so you can also deal with Deng Ai at the same time and prevent the catapults from getting set up.

Like the Shadow Orb, doing things this way will make the rest of the stage significantly harder since you’ve ignored objectives and officers in the center of the stage. Salvage what you can by stopping Zhong Hui’s rampage down the eastern part of your camp and dealing with the other officers, or you can just take the fight straight to Sima Yi if you’re daring. You can also just play as Jiang Wei or Zhuge Liang so that you won’t have to worry about protecting the commander.

### Effect Items<br> (Obtainable on all difficulties)<br>

———<br>

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Art of War" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/303d4bbe-5616-4367-a7c5-ee428a1174fa" /><br>
***Art of War***
* **Effect:** Increases the duration of temporary buffs by 20%
* **Stage:** Battle of Chi Bi (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Make Zhuge Liang’s unit retreat, and then defeat him before he flees the stage.<br>

**Notes:** In order to make Zhuge Liang retreat, you have to sabotage the fire attack by defeating Huang Gai before he’s able to summon the winds. He’ll then remark that he’s not needed anymore and will begin to flee. He’s all the way over on the mainland to the west and close to a checkpoint, so you’ll probably need Red Hare in order to reach him in time.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In Ou Xing’s Rebellion, get 300 KOs within the first 5 minutes of the stage.*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Survival Guide" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b44c7b7-78a3-4c39-ac55-95b32d73d14b" /><br>
***Survival Guide***
* **Effect:** When you’re knocked to the ground and your health bar is red, gives you the 2x Attack buff
* **Stage:** Battle of Hu Lao Gate (Dong Zhuo’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Sun Jian, and Gongzun Zan.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory. Use the map to check where they are.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In the Battle of Shi Ting, get 200 KOs, succeed in the fire attack, and defeat Xu Zhu and Xu Huang.*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Bodyguard Manual" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/933e9717-1ba9-4002-89f3-a8e67aec1ea2" /><br>
***Bodyguard Manual***
* **Effect:** Boosts the stats of your bodyguard
* **Stage:** Guan Yu’s Escape (Guan Yu’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Zhang Liao and Xu Huang.<br>

**Notes:** This is a completely linear stage, so you’ll fulfil this condition without any extra effort. The annoying part is the crate spawning at the very beginning of the stage, so ride all the way back and also take out Xiahou Dun while you’re at it. Just make sure you don’t leave any units near the carriage alive, they can destroy it offscreen if you do.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In the Ten Eunuchs’ Rebellion, defeat the fake Eunuchs. He Jin must be alive.*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Demon Band" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d387e0-0cb5-40a7-b4e8-a9c7e29bf564" /><br>
***Demon Band***
* **Effect:** Musou Rage duration is doubled to 30 seconds
* **Stage:** Battle of Xi Liang (Yellow Turban Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Ma Chao within 3 minutes of his arrival.<br>

**Notes:** Ma Chao spawns at the northeastern checkpoint a few minutes into the stage.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In the Battle of Jia Meng Gate, get 200 KOs within the first 5 minutes of the stage.*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Way of the Musou" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/782bc2e5-2fbd-47a7-9529-7eef84eb8260" /><br>
***Way of Musou***
* **Effect:** Your Musou attack will always be the True Musou variant
* **Stage:** Battle of Mt. Ding Jun (Shu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Xiahou Yuan before Cao Cao arrives.<br>

**Notes:** You have a time limit of around 10 minutes before Cao Cao arrives. Xiahou Yuan is *very* tanky and can enter Musou Rage, so be careful.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In Ou Xing’s Rebellion, defeat all the enemy units apart from Ou Xing within the first 5 minutes of the stage.*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Wind Scroll" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2766b34c-dd22-45ea-9183-220512de5f3f" /><br>
***Wind Scroll***
* **Effect:** Increases the hit range of your attacks
* **Stage:** Battle of He Fei Castle (Wu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Cao Ren within the first 5 minutes of the stage.<br>

**Notes:** Cao Ren is in front of the enemy checkpoint in the very center of the stage. Go straight to him by infiltrating the castle through the side gates.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In The Two Qiaos, defeat Zuo Ci within a minute of his arrival.*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Fire Arrow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd08ccbd-11a8-40b8-8a69-a10c30f07a56" /><br>
***Fire Arrows***
* **Effect:** Augments your bow attack with the Fire element. Also affects Huang Zhong and Xiahou Yuan’s bow charge attacks.
* **Stage:** Battle of Ji Province (Yuan Shao’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Pei Yuanshao after defeating Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao.<br>

**Notes:** Pei Yuanshao guards the altar in the middle of the stage. Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao will gradually move towards it to pray and increase the strength of the tornadoes, so just kill them as they come down the road.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In the Battle of Han Shui, defeat Xu Huang after failing to protect your main camp (Zhao Yun) or failing the ambush (Huang Zhong).*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Arm Guards" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8442d0de-4a1e-480d-9102-6628c76cc73f" /><br>
***Arm Guards***
* **Effect:** Charge attacks cannot be interrupted by enemy attacks
* **Stage:** Battle of Si Shui Gate (Dong Zhuo’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Sun Jian before Cao Cao arrives.<br>

**Notes:** Cao Cao shows up around 5 minutes in, but that’s plenty of time to take out Sun Jian. Just ride down to the south and kill him.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In the Battle of Mai Castle, defeat every officer and their sub-officers, including the ambush units.*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Tiger Collar" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef4d680-2dc6-4d41-b09c-a3fc74cc5a46" /><br>
***Tiger Collar***
* **Effect:** A tiger will accompany you during the stage; attacks with melee and is invincible
* **Stage:** Struggle For Nan Zhong
* **Conditions:** Defeat 3 Beastmasters within the first minute of the stage.<br>

**Notes:** The Beastmasters are past the empty base on the west. They’re very weak, so you should have no trouble taking them out while mounted on Red Hare.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In The Two Qiaos, defeat Zhou Tai after failing the tiger trial (Zhou Yu's route only).*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Green Scroll" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8af07bf9-34b1-4397-89fc-f484af670ce4" /><br>
***Green Scroll***
* **Effect:** Increases Attack and reduces Defense
* **Stage:** Battle of Jie Ting (Shu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Xu Zhu, and then defeat Sima Yi within the next 3 minutes.<br>

**Notes:** Xu Zhu shows up shortly after Ma Su is trapped on the mountain and will go down the eastern side of the stage. Capture one of the checkpoints surrounding Ma Su’s base to lure Sima Yi out of the enemy camp.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In the Battle of Han Shui, defeat Xu Huang after the bridge is destroyed.*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Musou Armor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac2bec36-e562-41ee-9292-fa57b684adcd" /><br>
***Musou Armor***
* **Effect:** You won’t be stunned or dismounted when hit by arrows
* **Stage:** Conquest of Nan Zhong (Nanman Forces)
* **Conditions:** Destroy all 7 juggernauts within 7 minutes of destroying the first one.<br>

**Notes:** The juggernauts are in the clearing at the north-center of the stage and will spawn once you or your allies approach Yueying. Juggernauts are very annoying to deal with as their attacks inflict Fire and stun you onto the ground. Try only taking on one at a time, and stand directly behind it so that you have time to get out of the way before it turns around and fires.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In the Battle of Ji Castle, get 200 KOs before Zhang He arrives, and then defeat Zhang He before Xiahou Yuan arrives.*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Tribal Remedy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77d4e67a-f051-4130-ad27-c44f45330fd8" /><br>
***Tribal Remedy***
* **Effect:** Recovers 50 HP for every 100 KOs
* **Stage:** Battle of He Fei Castle (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Destroy both rams, and defeat Jiang Qin, Pan Zhang, and Sun Shao.<br>

**Notes:** The rams will head towards the inner castle gate from the ship on the east. Pan Zhang will spawn in the northeast once the Wu navy cutscene plays, and the second ram will spawn shortly afterwards if you destroyed the first one. Sun Shao will spawn in the northwest with an ambush unit some time later.

The toughest part is actually killing Sun Shao since your allies are very likely to kill him first before you get to him, since it’s a *very* long trip to the top. You can get around this by playing as Cao Pi, since that way your allies will be stuck at low morale until you go up to his ambush unit. <br>

***Legend Mode:** In Husbands and Wives, quarrel with and defeat the other 3 couples within the first 7 minutes of the stage.*

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Serpent Earrings" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e0653c-759f-414f-9c6f-4e87f7b958d4" /><br>
***Serpent Earrings***
* **Effect:** Permanent +2 to the Attack stat for every 100 KOs
* **Stage:** Battle of He Fei (Wu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Xu Huang and Xiahou Dun within a minute after they arrive.<br>

**Notes:** Xu Huang shows up at the southwestern corner of the stage around 3 minutes in. Zhang Liao will also show up a minute afterwards, so quickly go to the center after killing Xu Huang and take him out to protect Sun Quan.

 Xiahou Dun shows up at the northeastern corner of the stage around 9 minutes in and will immediately start heading to the south at breakneck speed, so make sure you’re there to intercept him.<br>

***Legend Mode:** In the Battle of Ru Xu Kou, defeat Xu Huang, Cao Ren, Xiahou Dun, and all 3 of Zhang Liao’s appearances.*

***Naga Earrings***
* **Effect:** Permanent +2 to the Defense stat for every 100 KOs
* **Stage:** Battle of Xin Castle
* **Conditions:** Defeat Deng Xian, Li Fu, Shen Dan, and Shen Yi, and get 80 KOs, all within the first 2 minutes of the stage.<br>

**Notes:** Use Red Hare to rush to all of the officers and take them out, and make sure you pick up the KOs along the way. You can stop by the attack base to pick up some extra KOs if you need them, but you likely won’t need to.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Dragon Arms" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad7b25f-f098-4cd9-ad34-324e9c7e1c24" /><br>
***Dragon Arms***
* **Effect:** Allows you to jump in the middle of a charge attack
* **Stage:** Battle of Mt. Qi
* **Conditions:** Fail Zhuge Liang’s plan and defeat all officers and their sub-officers.<br>

**Notes:** This only counts when you directly disobey Zhuge Liang’s orders and start attacking the officers at the beginning of the stage. Failing the hide and seek section doesn’t count for some reason, and you won’t spawn the item that way. It’s also highly advised you do this on Novice or Easy as you will literally be on your own against an entire army of enraged enemies that will all swarm to you at the same time.

<img width="64" height="64" alt="True Way of the Musou" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d7df991-4cc4-4f8e-862f-eaaeb4aac8be" /><br>
***True Way of Musou***
* **Effect:** Increases the strength of your Musou attacks and uses less Musou gauge
* **Stage:** Battle of Mai Castle
* **Conditions:** Get 1,000 KOs.<br>

**Notes:** It’s best to use either Guan Yu or Guan Ping for this so that you have one less commander to worry about. Kill as many soldiers outside the base as you can and then head over to the checkpoints at the east to grind out the remainder. Make sure you keep Cao Ren and Lu Meng away from the commander as he’ll have low HP all throughout.

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Ice Arrow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db8809c9-0f27-4d81-87a0-1ae5dbb1be97" /><br>
***Ice Arrows***
* **Effect:** Augments your bow attack with the Ice element. Also affects Huang Zhong and Xiahou Yuan’s bow charge attacks.
* **Stage:** Battle of Yang Ping Gate
* **Conditions:** Destroy all the stone statues within the first 5 minutes of the stage.<br>

**Notes:** There are rows of statues along the front of the first and second tier of the stage, as well as two in a nook to the east. Make sure you destroy those two so you can ride your horse down. You will need Red Hare for this, otherwise you’ll be cutting it *very* close.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Vampire Arms" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa507a9e-ee11-4f7c-80b2-401fe3e510f4" /><br>
***Vampire Arms***
* **Effect:** Restores 50 HP by activating guard stance against an enemy attack just before it lands
* **Stage:** The Ten Eunuchs’ Rebellion
* **Conditions:** Defeat 4 Rogue Leaders.<br>

**Notes:** You need to do this on either Hard or Chaos difficulty, as those are the only ones where 4 Rogue Leaders can spawn.

**The rogues do not spawn if He Jin is rescued. You have to let him die in the first wave.** Once the first wave of Eunuchs are killed, 4 carriages will spawn, with 3 of them being fakes that will spawn a Eunuch when destroyed. The real carriage will always be at the south exit. Every minute or so a Rogue Leader will come out of the south exit and attempt to destroy the southern carriage. Kill them when they appear. 

This item can be *very* annoying to get because the rogues will stop spawning once all three Eunuchs are defeated, which will happen very quickly because of how many allied units there are. The best way to prolong the section so that enough rogues spawn is to focus on ‘protecting’ one Eunuch by nudging him away from the allies with a horse, and keeping him in your range so that he doesn’t despawn and get killed offscreen via the morale system. Just make sure you keep him away from the southern carriage, since both allies and enemies can damage it, and you will fail the stage if it’s destroyed.

***Meat Bun Sack***
* **Effect:** All enemy soldiers have a set chance of dropping health items. **Does not work on Chaos.**
* **Stage:** Battle of Jia Meng Gate
* **Conditions:** Defeat Yang Ang, Yang Song, and Yang Ren.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory. They’re all near the enemy commander.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Kirin Hoof" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f00ec82c-0661-419b-9bef-db2df81ea36e" /><br>
***Kirin Hoof***
* **Effect:** Increases the damage dealt by trampling enemies with mounts, and the damage dealt by your tiger from the Tiger Collar
* **Stage:** Showdown at Nan Zhong
* **Conditions:** Defeat Xu Huang within the first 10 minutes of the stage.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory, and very lenient all things considered.

<h2 id=4thWeapons> II: 4th Weapons<br> (Only obtainable on Hard and Chaos; must be playing as the character who uses the weapon)</h2>



(Be aware that you are **NOT** automatically given the weapon upon fulfilling the conditions. When you fulfil them, a crate will spawn in the stage, which you must then collect and then finish the stage in order to register. You can check exactly where the crate spawned by using the Battle Log.)

### Shu Characters<br>

———<br>

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zhao Yun" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de8febed-cfa9-43d6-b569-a10b1f2a63b2" /><br>
***Zhao Yun - Fierce Dragon***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Charge+16, Def+17, Atk+17, Musou+17, Life+17
* **Stage:** Battle of Cheng Du (Liu Bei’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** In the first 5 minutes of the stage, capture Luo Castle by defeating Liu Xun and all 3 of his sub-officers, and opening all 3 gates.<br>

**Notes:** Zhao Yun spawns right next to the castle, so it’s just a matter of killing everyone inside. Make sure you take out the sub-officers first so that they won’t be able to flee.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Guan Yu" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aef5712-2940-4ee1-bf2b-7fa320b1791d" /><br>
***Guan Yu - Blue Moon Dragon***
* **Stats:** Light, Power+38, Charge+16, Horse+16, Def+17, Atk+18, Life+18
* **Stage:** Battle of Fan Castle (Shu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Yue Jin and Niu Jin before the water attack is executed, and then make sure the water attack succeeds.<br>

**Notes:** You have a time limit of about 5 minutes to defeat them. Both of them are on the northern side of the stage and will gradually move towards the floodgates. Just make sure you don’t enter the castle, otherwise the water attack will be cancelled.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zhang Fei" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25288e73-332a-468b-8d32-f461de9b3bb2" /><br>
***Zhang Fei - Viper Blade***
* **Stats:** Light, Power+39, Fill+16, Horse+16, Def+15, Atk+19, Musou+17
* **Stage:** Battle of Chang Ban (Liu Bei’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Xiahou Dun, Li Dian, Yu Jin, and Xiahou En. Don’t let them or any other sub-officers get past the bridge.<br>

**Notes:** Letting the enemy soldiers past the bridge is fine. Just go west up the road and take out any sub-officers you see along the way. Make sure you take out Xiahou En way in the back; he’s Yu Jin’s sub-officer and will flee if he’s killed.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zhuge Liang" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/029c5b17-ac0d-41c7-86c2-3c0600022bd2" /><br>
***Zhuge Liang - Peacock Feather***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+32, Charge+18, Fill+15, Bow+15, Def+18, Musou+20
* **Stage:** Battle of Tian Shui (Shu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Make Jiang Wei retreat to Tian Shui Castle, and defeat him before he gets there.<br>

**Notes:** Jiang Wei will only pull back once you capture both of the castles and trick Ma Zun. Capture the castles as fast as possible because Jiang Wei’s high morale will quickly wipe out the allies attacking him. Abuse Zhuge Liang’s Light element attacks to quickly combo him and take him out.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Liu Bei" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5edc28a-5fa1-4671-a698-29b5fc57718d" /><br>
***Liu Bei - Gold Moon Dragon***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+34, Luck+20, Horse+15, Speed+18, Def+18, Musou+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Yi Ling (Shu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Gan Ning, Ling Tong, Sun Shangxiang, and Lu Xun.<br>

**Notes:** It’s **highly recommended** that you take out Zhu Ran before anyone else, since Gan Ning and Ling Tong are enraged while he’s alive and you will lose a *lot* of morale if the fire attack succeeds. The bridge will immediately be deployed if you try to sneak up on them from the west, so just wait around the river bank until it drops so you can catch and kill Zhu Ran.

I would recommend using your interim save for Sun Shangxiang. She will begin to flee from the stage once you approach her, so keep knocking her down and kill her before she escapes into a checkpoint.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Ma Chao" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b89beb-6a42-4f16-8cc2-776d57de620f" /><br>
***Ma Chao - Stallion Fury***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+38, Horse+20, Speed+15, Def+16, Atk+17, Life+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Tong Gate (Allied Forces)
* **Conditions:** Knock Cao Cao off his high horse before he crosses the river.<br>

**Notes:** This is a funny one. Cao Cao will head to cross the river once you approach his camp, so just beeline over to him with Red Hare and smack him.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Huang Zhong" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf940f2d-34e1-487e-9e3d-644cc3b6124b" /><br>
***Huang Zhong - Oracle Sword***
* **Stats:** Light, Power+36, Fill+18, Horse+15, Bow+20, Def+15, Musou+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Mt. Ding Jun (Shu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He before Cao Cao arrives.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory. Xiahou Yuan is *very* tanky and can enter Musou Rage, so it’s best to take him out first.

**The weapon only appears when Cao Cao arrives.** There is another crate that spawns once you defeat Xiahou Yuan, but it’s a special item and is *not* related.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Jiang Wei" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9b1b933-b560-49a3-b9da-30aec4b76f81" /><br>
***Jiang Wei - Blink***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Luck+15, Speed+15, Atk+16, Musou+18, Life+17
* **Stage:** Battle of Tian Shui (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Allow both of the castles to be taken by enemy forces, and then defeat Gao Xiang’s ambush unit once Ma Zun begins to retreat.<br>

**Notes:** You have to do what Jiang Wei does best and completely fail at your job. Hang around the northeastern side of the stage and wait for both castles to fall. In the meantime you can take out the fake Jiang Wei and any other enemies nearby.

Ma Zun will eventually flee the castle and go east, where Gao Xiang will ambush him. Take him out and then go and get the weapon **immediately**, because Ma Zun will then decide to go straight to Zhuge Liang. Take him out before Ma Zun gets killed.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Wei Yan" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe9adbdc-d853-40c6-8159-ebce23a7c77d" /><br>
***Wei Yan - Comet Strike***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Charge+16, Luck+15, Def+16, Atk+18, Musou+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Chen Cang (Shu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat all 4 Defense Captains.<br>

**Notes:** There are 3 Defense Captains on top of the outer castle walls and another one behind the guarded entrance to the west. You have to infiltrate the castle from the eastern road to reach the first 3, and then defeat Cao Ren and go to the entrance from the inside of the castle to get to the final one.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Pang Tong" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dcf2c37-7401-4064-9afc-62a4c73f1c2a" /><br>
***Pang Tong - Tornado Staff***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+32, Fill+18, Luck+15, Bow+16, Def+17, Life+15
* **Stage:** Conquest of Nan Zhong (Shu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Succeed in executing all of Shu’s ploys against the Nanman people.<br>

**Notes:** This includes building the log bridge over the poisonous swamp, setting up the explosives against the armor troops, and deploying the juggernauts against the beast units. They’re all pretty simple to pull off and are explained by the characters in the stage itself. Just make sure you kill Wu Tugu before he kills the explosives task unit.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Yueying" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d33727c3-732a-406f-af09-46b5ef90d89c" /><br>
***Yueying - Oblivion***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Charge+15, Horse+15, Bow+16, Def+17, Life+16
* Stage: Battle of Wu Zhang Plains (Shu Forces)
* Conditions: Defeat Deng Ai before he sets up the catapults.<br>

**Notes:** Deng Ai will begin to move to set up the catapults either once enough time has passed or once you enter one of the 3 supply bases defending the enemy camp. I recommend entering the camp through the western supply base to catch Deng Ai as soon as he begins to move. Just beware that Xu Zhu is nearby and will do his best to make sure Deng Ai gets away.

Once the weapon spawns, I then recommend you go and do the wood oxen objective and/or kill Zhong Hui to make the rest of the stage easier, and then pick up the weapon afterwards.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Guan Ping" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da2de1a0-c619-4c43-b382-4913d1be3983" /><br>
***Guan Ping - Young Dragon***
* **Stats:** Light, Power+36, Charge+16, Luck+15, Bow+15, Atk+17, Life+15
* **Stage:** Escape From Chi Bi (Allied Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat all of the officers.<br>

**Notes:** Sub-officers do not count, you only need to kill the main officers. 

Xun You is the final officer and he will spawn in the northeastern corner of the stage after Cao Cao has waited at the northern checkpoint for long enough. If you’ve taken out all the other officers and captured the checkpoints, your allies will be able to hold back Cao Cao to the point where you can kill Xun You, pick up the weapon, and then finish off Cao Cao before he escapes.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Xing Cai" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/808a912e-5d04-4719-a31f-859d31bc9a80" /><br>
***Xingcai - Ambition***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+34, Horse+15, Speed+16, Def+17, Musou+17, Life+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Bai Di Castle (Shu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Rescue the peasant militia, get knocked down into red health, and then escort Liu Chan back to the castle once he meets up with you.<br>

**Notes: Make sure you clear out all the enemies on the castle’s south road before you do this, otherwise Liu Chan will get surrounded and will likely die.** Once you trigger the event where he moves out, simply ride back and meet him on the road, and then enter the castle.

### Wei Characters<br>

———<br>

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Xiahou Dun" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39adc639-52b4-4566-bce8-f0dbeb8ecd10" /><br>
***Xiahou Dun - Kirin Fang***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Charge+17, Horse+16, Def+17, Atk+17, Musou+16
* **Stage:** Battle of Fan Castle (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Guan Ping before he can execute the water attack.<br>

**Notes:** Guan Ping will start preparing the water attack around 5 minutes into the stage or once you approach the floodgates. From there you have a time limit of a few minutes to defeat him. He’s tanky, and both Meng Da and Mi Fang will come to support him. It’s best if you take them out first and also the row of archers inside Guan Ping’s base.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Dian Wei" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e513c42b-dd12-4c9b-8878-82df777d579e" /><br>
**Dian Wei - Mad Bull**
* **Stats:** Light, Power+38, Charge+15, Fill+15, Atk+18, Musou+17, Life+17
* **Stage:** Battle of Wan Castle
* **Conditions:** Don’t let any Task Leaders get past the checkpoint.<br>

**Notes:** Use your interim save for when this section begins so that you can restart if you fail. This weapon is very annoying because Task Leaders can slip past you from a small opening to the east, and Dian Wei himself is a very slow character with not much range. Just stick close to the checkpoint and use the zoomed in minimap so you can see where the groups of enemies are going, and use a horse to move around.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Xu Zhu" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffbf9420-b17e-410a-9a9a-520c6e5d205a" /><br>
**Xu Zhu - Stone Crusher**
* **Stats:** Light, Power+38, Fill+17, Luck+15, Bow+19, Def+19, Life+20
* **Stage:** Battle of Tong Gate (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Ma Chao and Pang De while Han Sui is still alive.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory. Both Ma Chao and Pang De are enraged and can enter Musou Rage, so be careful.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Cao Cao" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02554876-75c1-4c87-8f7d-02ac94f327c8" /><br>
***Cao Cao - Wrath of Heaven***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+34, Charge+17, Horse+17, Bow+15, Atk+17, Life+17
* **Stage:** Battle of Xia Pi (Allied Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Gao Shun before he reinforces the dam.<br>

**Notes:** Use Red Hare to make a beeline towards the north of the stage where Gao Shun is. You have a few minutes to kill him before the dam is reinforced.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Xiahou Yuan" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65ef6c6f-53a6-40fd-a9aa-a0707aa35bcd" /><br>
**Xiahou Yuan - Enforcer Rod**
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Charge+16, Bow+19, Atk+16, Musou+17, Life+17
* **Stage:** Battle of Chi Bi (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Sabotage every part of the fire attack.<br>

**Notes:** Defeat Pang Tong after he defects and before he reaches the Wu fleet. You should spawn right next to or close to him, so just kill him as soon as he turns red.

It’s important that you kill Zhuge Liang **before** you kill Huang Gai, because Zhuge Liang will flee if Huang Gai is killed first. It’s also important that you kill Zhuge Liang **after approaching the altar and Cao Pi declaring it a threat**, otherwise the condition isn’t fulfilled for some reason. Kill Huang Gai afterwards and the weapon should spawn.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zhang Liao" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27c62800-a389-4829-badd-193b10b46045" /><br>
***Zhang Liao - Gold Wyvern***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Fill+15, Luck+15, Horse+18, Atk+17, Life+17
* **Stage:** Battle of He Fei (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Strike fear into Sun Quan’s army before Cao Ren arrives.<br>

**Notes:** In order to do this you must either kill a total of 9 officers (sub-officers count) or get 750 KOs. You’ll know you’ve done it once Sun Quan remarks on how his soldiers have been stricken with fear. You have around 10 minutes to do this before Cao Ren arrives.

Use Red Hare and your map to immediately make beelines towards the closest officers. Prioritise sub-officers, as they’re weaker and will flee once their main officer is killed.

Once you’ve done all this, **immediately go and kill Gan Ning once he spawns**. He has maxed out morale and will immediately start heading towards the commander, and you will likely fail the stage if you ignore him.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Sima Yi" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/803b16a7-6fbf-48a1-99d9-d5a39ba2e4dc" /><br>
***Sima Yi - Dark Feather***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+32, Charge+15, Fill+15, Def+16, Atk+15, Musou+19
* **Stage:** Battle of Chen Cang (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Capture all three of the southern defense bases before the weapons damage the castle walls.<br>

**Notes:** Destroy the ram coming in from the east road, and afterwards just rush down to the defense bases and capture them before the castle is damaged. Be careful of the officers lingering around them.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Xu Huang" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e0547eb-c4da-4f2e-9c5a-7545ca5d530b" /><br>
***Xu Huang - Marauder***
* Stats: Light, Power+36, Fill+15, Luck+15, Speed+15, Atk+17, Life+18
* Stage: Battle of Chang Ban (Cao Cao’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Guan Yu and Zhang Fei after Liu Qi and the escape point show up.<br>

**Notes:** Play the stage as normal, but make sure Zhang Fei and Guan Yu are kept alive. Before Liu Qi shows up it’s **highly recommended** that you capture the bases at the bottom of the stage so that Liu Bei gets halted, giving you much more time to get the weapon. Zhang Fei is also enraged in this stage.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zhang He" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36de23f5-120b-47e6-bebb-4730210cdcad" /><br>
***Zhang He - Phoenix Talon***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Charge+15, Fill+15, Speed+19, Atk+16, Musou+19
* Stage: Battle of Jie Ting (Wei Forces)
* Conditions: Defeat Ma Su once he begins to retreat from the mountain.<br>

**Notes:** You have to isolate Ma Su by taking the two checkpoints at the flank and rear of the mountain. The important part is to make sure to keep him alive afterwards. He will stop attacking, and *then* begin to retreat a little while later. You must kill him while he’s retreating to make the weapon appear.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zhenji" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b439879e-1164-40cf-9e30-e0c9d945e191" /><br>
***Zhenji - Dark Moon Flute***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+32, Fill+20, Horse+17, Bow+18, Def+18, Life+17
* **Stage:** Battle of He Fei Castle (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Get 300 KOs, and then meet up with Cao Pi.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory. Cao Pi is all the way up to the north and will trigger a cutscene once you approach him.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Cao Ren" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/565a158a-f5c3-45d8-835a-8e675c4a5beb" /><br>
***Cao Ren - Roc***
* **Stats:** Light, Power+32, Fill+15, Bow+15, Def+18, Atk+15, Life+19
* **Stage:** Escape From Chi Bi (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** With the exception of Guan Yu and Liu Bei, defeat all of the ambush units before their respective Wei reinforcements show up, and then defeat Sun Quan.<br>

**Notes:** A pretty annoying one to get. Once a Shu or Wu ambush unit appears, you have a short amount of time to kill their main officer before a Wei officer shows up to assist you. You have to defeat Cheng Pu, Han Dang, Zhu Zhi, Zhao Yun, Zhang Fei, and Guan Ping. Afterwards, Sun Quan will spawn in the southeastern part of the stage.

The best way to do this is to ignore sub-officers and go straight for the main officer. Use the cooldown between ambushes to either capture checkpoints or get into position, since units only appear once Cao Cao walks over their spawn area.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Cao Pi" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cbd9b57-da12-4ca5-bf92-8349f85425de" /><br>
***Cao Pi - Chaos***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+34, Fill+15, Speed+19, Def+15, Atk+15, Musou+19
* **Stage:** Battle of Wu Zhang Plains (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** Make Zhuge Liang succumb to his illness earlier than expected, and then destroy all the arbalests in the center of the stage.<br>

**Notes:** Killing 3 officers (**sub-officers do not count**) will make Zhuge Liang die early. Afterwards, Jiang Wei will initiate a retreat and then spawn arbalests in the square-shaped spot in the stage.

Make sure you take out the arbalests in the center first so that you don’t get sniped by them when taking out the ones on the edges. Also beware the archers in the towers and the juggernauts.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Pang De" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb72c29a-9bff-4fac-8a99-4427c767445e" /><br>
***Pang De - Heavenly Halberd***
* **Stats:** Light, Power+36, Luck+15, Horse+17, Def+15, Atk+16, Life+18
* **Stage:** Battle of Mt. Ding Jun (Wei Forces)
* **Conditions:** With the exception of Liu Bei, defeat every enemy unit before Cao Cao arrives.<br>

**Notes:** There is a time limit of about 10 minutes, but Cao Cao will appear immediately after Huang Zhong is killed, so you have to save him for last. He will also immediately show up if Xiahou Yuan is killed. At some point a 7 or 8-star morale unit will Leeroy Jenkins down the mountain to attack Xiahou Yuan, so you have to go and save him when that happens.

**Do not go to the center until every other unit surrounding it is dead**. Huang Zhong will immediately rush down and attack Xiahou Yuan if you start to climb the mountain. Quickly dispatch the other unit on the mountain and then go straight to Huang Zhong. Try to keep him away from Xiahou Yuan, since he can enter Musou Rage.

### Wu Characters<br>

———<br>

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zhou Yu" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0814187f-cff4-43f5-8254-10229c8416c1" /><br>
***Zhou Yu - Ancients Sword***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+34, Charge+17, Bow+16, Def+15, Atk+16, Musou+18
* **Stage:** Battle of the Wu Territory (Sun Ce’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Yan Baihu and Wang Lang.<br>

**Notes:** No, that’s seriously it. By far the easiest 4th weapon in the game.

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Lu Xun" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4c42f14-6b52-4dc3-84db-aeb45a62db23" /><br>
***Lu Xun - Falcon***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+34, Fill+15, Luck+18, Speed+20, Atk+15, Musou+19
* **Stage:** Battle of Bai Di Castle (Wu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Ma Chao and Jiang Wei before Yueying arrives.<br>

**Notes:** Yueying appears shortly after you kill Xingcai or if you or your allies go into the castle, so **avoid doing either of those.**

Prioritise killing Ma Chao first. He’s *very* strong and will disappear and reappear on the southwestern side of the stage with maxed out morale a little while after your allies start attacking the peasant militia.

Once he’s dealt with, get to Jiang Wei by going through the Stone Sentinel Maze. Make sure you ride past the arbalests so that they don’t snipe you while you’re fighting; they hit pretty hard on these difficulties.

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Taishi Ci" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b93513c4-9cc1-46cb-9ba2-a8faf6a7dbad" /><br>
***Taishi Ci - Tiger Slayer***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+38, Charge+15, Horse+15, Bow+15, Def+18, Life+18
* **Stage:** Battle of the Wu Territory (Allied Forces)
* **Conditions:** After Sun Quan is ambushed in the fortress, defeat either him or Zhou Tai before they meet up, and then defeat the other.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory. It’s best to follow Sun Quan until he’s ambushed and then kill him right after, since it takes a while for Zhou Tai to get there anyway.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Sun Shang Xiang" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58b8fbe0-bb9b-4392-914d-f96642ff39d8" /><br>
***Sun Shangxiang - Sol Chakram***
* **Stats:** Heavy, Power+32, Luck+19, Bow+15, Speed+19, Def+17, Life+15
* **Stage:** The Invasion of Nan Zhong (Wu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat every officer and sub-officer while all of your allied units are alive.<br>

**Notes:** This includes all of the possible enemy reinforcements that can spawn. 

In order to make all of them appear, you have to let the bridge get destroyed, and you also have to keep Zhurong alive so that her backup unit will spawn later in the stage. Make sure you go to Sun Quan and defeat all the officers around him when the bridge is destroyed. Check your allies’ morale with Unit Info to see if any of them need help.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Sun Jian" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2d4e772-e25d-431c-b974-7b2f766c7fa4" /><br>
***Sun Jian - Savage Tiger***
* **Stats:** Light, Power+34, Fill+18, Horse+16, Def+16, Musou+15, Life+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Si Shui Gate (Allied Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Lu Bu within 5 minutes after his appearance.<br>

**Notes:** Lu Bu is much weaker here compared to his Hu Lao Gate version, but he can still be a big threat if you get overwhelmed by enemy numbers. Just keep juggling him and knocking him to the ground, and run away when he enters Musou Rage to be safe.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Sun Quan" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e0a213a-6a4e-494b-ab11-1c7d2db06847" /><br>
***Sun Quan - Master Wolf***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+34, Charge+17, Fill+15, Bow+15, Atk+16, Musou+18
* **Stage:** Battle of Chi Bi (Allied Forces)
* **Conditions:** Successfully execute every part of the fire attack (chaining the ships together, summoning the winds, sending out the fire ship).<br>

**Notes:** Essentially this just means doing every objective in the stage. 

Take out the central bridges by killing the sub-officers standing on them, and then make sure Huang Gai is protected by clearing out the enemies and checkpoints around him and his path. Eventually the enemy will breach the altar and halt Zhuge Liang’s wind prayer, but making sure Huang Gai survives is the bigger priority because he has low morale and pretty much no troops. Once Xiahou Yuan is defeated, you’re free to go and save Zhuge Liang.

**The weapon will only appear once all the objectives are fulfilled and the fire attack is at full power**. It’s also **highly recommended** that you do this in Sun Quan’s Musou Mode, since Chi Bi is only his second stage, and it’s a 5-star difficulty stage otherwise in Free Mode.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Lu Meng" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1791b318-440a-48e7-9e85-fe078cd74b7f" /><br>
***Lu Meng - White Tiger***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Charge+15, Horse+16, Bow+15, Def+17, Life+17
* **Stage:** Battle of Fan Castle (Wu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Make Mi Fang and Fu Shiren defect, and then defeat Zhang Bao and Zhang Fei while they’re still alive.<br>

**Notes:** Wait until Lu Xun says that their morale is low, and then go and attack them. They will defect once they get reduced to around half of their health.

The tricky part is actually keeping them alive since they will be stuck at half of their health after their beating. It’s best to deal with the other officers in the stage first before making them defect, and then clear out all the enemies around them and stick around on their side of the stage until the Zhangs appear in the southwestern base. 

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Gan Ning" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fefc83de-78d0-48ed-aae8-b760252b4cc8" /><br>
***Gan Ning - Sea Master***
* **Stats:** Light, Power+38, Charge+15, Luck+18, Speed+15, Atk+19, Musou+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Xia Kou (Huang Zu’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Ling Cao and Ling Tong. Cai Mao must be alive.<br>

**Notes:** It’s **highly recommended** you go right past Ling Cao and kill Ling Tong first. If Ling Cao is killed first, Ling Tong will become enraged and will be *much* more dangerous. 

You can do this in Gan Ning’s Musou Mode to make it easier, since it’s his first stage.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Huang Gai" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f076037f-7472-4c05-9121-1dbf133d98ad" /><br>
***Huang Gai - Dark Shadow***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Charge+15, Luck+16, Def+17, Atk+17, Life+15
* **Stage:** The Yellow Turban Rebellion (Han Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat every officer and sub-officer, except those inside the main enemy camp.<br>

**Notes:** This is an annoying one because your allies can very easily take out a sub-officer if you’re not paying attention. It doesn’t help that they’re spread out all across the stage. The best method is to use Red Hare and prioritise the enemy units that have the lowest morale and are already engaged with an allied unit. Use Unit Info to check where the sub-officers are.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Sun Ce" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0af0a1f-b16f-4139-acaa-96b89cad8788" /><br>
***Sun Ce - Overlord***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Charge+15, Speed+18, Atk+18, Musou+15, Life+15
* **Stage:** The Trials of Sun Ce
* **Conditions:** Defeat all of Yu Ji’s phantoms.<br>

**Notes:** This includes the phantoms of Sun Jian and Daqiao. Like every other ‘defeat’ condition, Sun Ce must be the one to deal the killing blow to all of them in order to make it count. For this reason it’s recommended that you don’t bring a bodyguard into the stage since they are capable of killstealing. If you’re having trouble you can lure the phantoms behind the buildings to take them on one at a time.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Da Qiao" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4608470f-38dc-4e34-a6df-94e179c7675d" /><br>
***Daqiao - Qiao Beauty***
* **Stats**: Heavy, Power+32, Luck+18, Def+15, Atk+16, Musou+19, Life+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Xia Kou (Wu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Cai Mao and Gan Ning. Ling Tong must be alive.<br>

**Notes:** This is a spicy one. Gan Ning is *very* dangerous because of his x2 Attack buff and Musou Rage combo, and his *devastating* True Musou that will obliterate everyone around him, including Ling Tong, if he gets it off. Sun Ce will also be following you the entire time, **and you will fail the stage if he’s killed**. Just keep Gan Ning knocked down for as long as you can and don’t give him any chances to attack or use his Musou. If he enters Musou Rage, **lure him away**, otherwise he’s likely to kill the others.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Xiao Qiao" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0a5dfd7-daa9-4933-88c7-41a0e9f6ad60" /><br>
***Xiaoqiao - Qiao Grace***
* **Stats:** Heavy, Power+32, Charge+17, Fill+15, Speed+19, Def+15, Musou+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Jing Province (Sun Jian’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Cai Mao and Lu Gong before Huang Zu ambushes Sun Jian.<br>

**Notes:** You only have a couple of minutes to do this, so use Red Hare and quickly ride up the eastern side of the stage to get to Cai Mao. Take out Lu Gong on the way.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zhou Tai" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b689f3ca-2bc7-4db2-b656-7b7b300262d7" /><br>
***Zhou Tai - Dusk***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Fill+16, Speed+15, Atk+17, Musou+18, Life+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Yi Ling (Wu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Zhao Yun before the fire attack happens, and then make sure the fire attack succeeds.<br>

**Notes:** Zhao Yun is all the way over on the west side of the stage. Before you go after him, lure out and kill the officers in the center of the stage by taking the outer bases. That way Zhu Ran can safely get to the fire attack site.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Ling Tong" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47eafad6-15a0-471f-b18f-b420b6d4acb0" /><br>
***Ling Tong - Dragon Fury***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Charge+16, Luck+16, Speed+19, Atk+17, Life+15
* **Stage:** Battle of He Fei (Wu Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Zhang Liao all 4 times.<br>

**Notes:** Zhang Liao will first spawn in the center of the stage around 4 minutes in and will head towards Sun Quan. After he’s defeated, he will temporarily withdraw and eventually return 3 more times at the northernmost checkpoint, southwesternmost checkpoint, and right outside the eastern wall of the enemy camp in that order. He always has maxed out morale, is enraged, and has a permanent x2 Attack buff on his reappearances.

This is a very long and annoying weapon to get because Ling Tong has to deal the killing blow to Zhang Liao all 4 times to make it count, and it’s possible for other officers to killsteal. Kill the other units as quickly as possible so that all the allies head towards the enemy camp and leave Zhang Liao alone, and use your interim save on either the third or fourth appearance so that you won’t have to start all over again if you fail or die.

### Other Characters<br>

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Diao Chan" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d23f823a-a0e3-4d4a-b81c-ee2a76d6509b" /><br>
***Diaochan - Diva***
* **Stats:** Heavy, Power+32, Fill+18, Luck+18, Speed+19, Def+16, Musou+18
* **Stage:** Battle of Xia Pi (Lu Bu’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Rescue Hou Cheng and Song Xian, and then defeat every officer and sub-officer before Cao Cao arrives.<br>

**Notes:** Equip Red Hare and immediately rush to them on the western side of the stage. They will be attacked by Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan’s sub-officers. Check where they are by using Unit Info.

Once they’re dealt with and the game informs you that they’ve been saved, start killing every other unit. Make sure you save Liu Bei for last because Cao Cao will spawn as soon as you kill him.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Lu Bu" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b57a7b85-c476-4c97-a542-c8ba84f60e0e" /><br>
***Lu Bu - Sky Scorcher***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+40, Horse+20, Def+20, Atk+20, Musou+19, Life+19
* **Stage:** Battle of Chang Shan (Yuan Shao’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Get 1,000 KOs.<br>

**Notes:** Go through the stage like normal and then park yourself in front of one of the northern checkpoints to farm the rest of the KOs. You can also just wait a fair distance away from it so that you don’t accidentally kill the guard captain.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Dong Zhuo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50ca6fc5-73d5-490b-8da0-c7bb63aa5b21" /><br>
***Dong Zhuo - Horror***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+36, Luck+17, Horse+17, Def+15, Atk+18, Life+15
* **Stage:** Battle of Liang Province (Dong Zhuo’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Capture all 5 enemy bases, and then defeat Ma Chao and Pang De.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory. Pang De is enraged, so be careful.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Yuan Shao" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddf5f5aa-9453-4aaf-9142-0cd4ccb909cc" /><br>
***Yuan Shao - Sword of Kings***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+34, Fill+15, Horse+15, Bow+15, Def+18, Musou+17
* **Stage:** Battle of Guan Du (Yuan Shao’s Forces)
* **Conditions:** Succeed in the siege on Cao Cao’s base while Wen Chou and Yan Liang are alive.<br>

**Notes:** Your first and biggest priority is to kill Guan Yu, since he will kill Chou and Liang immediately if he reaches them. 

Afterwards, take out any officers that approach them and capture the bases guarding the bridges. Take out the officers and soldiers surrounding the siege weapons once they spawn, and eventually the castle gates will open.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zhang Jiao" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01db1c42-6a2c-413e-8306-a66523ecc9e8" /><br>
***Zhang Jiao - Volcano Staff***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+32, Charge+16, Fill+9 (yes really), Luck+15, Atk+15, Musou+17
* **Stage:** The Yellow Turban Rebellion (Yellow Turbans)
* **Conditions:** Without letting any allied officer or sub-officer be defeated, successfully help Zhang Liang, Zhang Bao, and Zhang Mancheng execute their ploys.<br>

<img width="200" height="119" alt="trethr" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0944d4a7-8214-474a-88ad-a6964f29bdd3" />
<br>

**Notes:** This is a complete troll of a weapon and will probably be the one that will give you the most trouble. Not only does Zhang Jiao have a terrible moveset, the Yellow Turban version of YTR is a 5-star difficulty stage and all of your units are weak and spread out at the beginning. Doing this requires a lot of speed and even a fair bit of luck.

To start with, Zhang Jiao’s moveset. Pretty much his only viable attacking method is C3, and letting it finish as early as possible to get a stun AoE out. Augment it with either Fire or Ice Orb and **never stop using it**.

Immediately start heading west to take out Gongzun Yue. Then immediately go to the altar in the center of the stage and stay within its perimeters. Make sure you keep away from the edges because it’s easy for enemies to knock you off the altar and delay the prayer. You may also want to make sure Yan Zheng and Gao Sheng are loaded in by keeping a close distance to them so that they don’t inexplicably die to the morale system. Do the same thing for Zhang Liang in the east.

You may want to bring a bodyguard with the Fame ability and kill as many soldiers as you can so that you can raise your allies’ morale easier and make it less likely for the sub-officers to die. **Once you get the weapon, use your interim save.**

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Meng Huo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16b27364-af64-43d1-915c-36279d90ff82" /><br>
***Meng Huo - King of Beasts***
* **Stats:** Light, Power+36, Charge+15, Fill+15, Horse+15, Atk+18, Life+19
* **Stage:** Conquest of Nan Zhong (Nanman Forces)
* **Conditions:** Without any of your allies defecting, defeat Wei Yan, Huang Zhong, and Yueying.<br>

**Notes:** Start by killing Wei Yan, and then proceed to the west and thwart Zhuge Liang’s plan by killing all the Task Leaders and preventing a defection. Then go and take out Huang Zhong, who will be near the poison swamp to the east. Finish by killing Yueying and make sure to avoid the juggernauts.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zhurong" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f45e7f74-652e-4e92-8091-c2882f8cc586" /><br>
***Zhurong - Inferno***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+34, Charge+16, Fill+17, Bow+15, Def+15, Musou+18
* **Stage:** The Invasion of Nan Zhong (Nanman Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Gan Ning and Jiang Qin without destroying the central bridge.<br>

Notes: Most of this is just a long and boring waiting game. It takes around 17 minutes for Gan Ning and Jiang Qin to show up, so just kill time by clearing out the enemies. Make sure you don’t go near the bridge and trigger its destruction though.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Zuo Ci" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd60d090-ba86-4509-a55c-9dccf25f666c" /><br>
***Zuo Ci - Trump Deck***
* **Stats:** Medium, Power+40, Charge+15, Fill+20, Bow+15, Def+15, Musou+20
* **Stage:** Battle of Hu Lao Gate (Allied Forces)
* **Conditions:** Defeat Lu Bu.<br>

**Notes:** It’s the battle of the god tiers. Hu Lao Gate Lu Bu is **EXTREMELY** dangerous. He has the highest HP, attack, and defense out of every enemy officer in the entire game, he will gain **permanent Musou Rage** once his health is low, and he only needs to hit you a few times in Musou Rage to kill you from full health. Fortunately Zuo Ci himself has a pretty busted moveset, so use that and a maxed item loadout to your full advantage.

There *are* ways to cheese this fight though. You can keep knocking Lu Bu away from the gate with Zuo Ci’s C5 or a horse, until he’s outside of his ‘attack radius’. This means he’ll keep trying to run back into position and won’t attack or guard while doing so. You can make this much easier by clearing out the checkpoints and enemy soldiers around your allies beforehand so that they’ll all pile onto Lu Bu, giving him less chances to recover.

**Use your one interim save on Hard difficulty for when Lu Bu is nearly dead.** It’s very easy for him to kill you from this point, and there’s always that ‘fun’ condition that Zuo Ci himself has to be the one to deal the killing blow, otherwise it doesn’t count. 


<h2 id=ChallengeMode>III: Challenge Mode</h2>


Challenge Mode consists of a set of 6 minigames that can be played with any character. All the achievements here are for beating the default 1st place score for all of them. They’re all relatively easy to do, so you shouldn’t have to spend long on them unless you’re going for RA leaderboard scores.

———<br>

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Bridge Melee" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a39dc586-664d-4a64-ab87-2a323e76ed55" /><br>
***Walked the Tight Rope***
* Finish Bridge Melee with more than 100 KOs.<br>

**Notes:** You have 10 minutes to knock as many enemies into the pit below as you can, but your attempt finishes early if you fall off or die. You’ll want to use characters with good range in their attacks, and who also have attacks with strong knockback.

You’ll want to avoid using characters that gain a lot of movement trajectory with their charge attacks or Musous, like Cao Cao and Guan Ping. You’ll be best off with mostly motionless characters that have good knockback coverage. Zhou Yu and Lu Xun’s jump charges can also knockback several enemies from a distance. 

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Sudden Death" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d15ec8e8-2040-48e8-9f51-92e01c75809c" /><br>
***Survivor***
* Finish Sudden Death with more than 300 KOs.<br>

**Notes:** All enemies die in one hit, but *you* also die in one hit. Characters with high attack speed and low animation delay, or who can attack from a long range, are the best pick for this mode.

You can very easily cheese this by picking Huang Zhong and spamming his C1. Most enemies won’t guard the arrows and you can pick off a lot of them from a distance. Ling Tong is also a solid choice because of his extremely fast attack speed, allowing him to set up an AoE before he’s even at risk of getting hit.

The biggest threats are enemies being able to spawn close to and sneak up on you, and archer units. Keep your minimap zoomed in so you can see if any groups are closing in on you from blind spots. Prioritise taking out archers or skirt around and run away from them entirely. Use your Musou attack as an invincibility state if you whiff a setup or unexpectedly get surrounded.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Gatekeeper" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3715d6d-b06b-4190-85d1-6c8d7c1bd203" /><br>
***None Shall Pass***
* Survive longer than 3 minutes in Gatekeeper.<br>

**Notes:** The attempt ends when 100 enemies slip past the gates. It’s very easy to survive past 3 minutes since there are so few enemies at the start, but if you’re going for a high score, characters with wide AoEs are the best choice.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Speed Strike" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8399cd6c-19a1-492f-9caa-f3bc1bfc5c45" /><br>
***Hard and Fast***
* Finish Speed Strike with more than 300 KOs.<br>

**Notes**: Crates and pots count as multiple KOs and defeated officers will drop speed buffs. Zuo Ci is the optimal pick for this mode since he has the highest natural movement speed, and his running attack makes him shoot a large piercing projectile straight ahead. Avoid using slow characters.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Time Attack" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f6400a2-5717-4116-81a8-b42834f78a7b" /><br>
***Never Knew What Hit ‘Em***
* Finish Time Attack in less than 3 minutes and 30 seconds.<br>

**Notes:** Kill all the enemies in the stage as fast as you can. Avoid using characters whose movesets have a lot of knockbacks, since you’ll just waste time chasing after them.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Rampage" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d425953f-64f3-4a0c-8ebf-d45fdfacfa32" /><br>
***Wake of Death***
* Finish Rampage with more than 1,000 KOs.<br>

**Notes:** This is a survival round against infinite waves of enemies and officers. Gan Ning is excellent at crowd control, as is Lu Bu.


<h2 id=XtremeMode>IV: Xtreme Mode</h2>


One of the modes exclusive to XL. This is basically a roguelike or arcade version of the typical Dynasty Warriors experience. You choose one character to play and you have one life to get through as many missions as possible. Your current amount of health persists between stages, and your methods for healing are limited.

There’s way too much about this mode to explain in an achievement guide, so I will only go over the most important advice I can provide when it matters in context. If you want to do a deep dive on all the ways this mode works, the entry on the [Koei Wiki ](https://koei.fandom.com/wiki/Xtreme_Mode#Dynasty_Warriors_5:_Xtreme_Legends_2) documents it.

———<br>

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Mission 50" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21ee0edd-a9bc-4c43-a406-a09addc076bb" /><br>
***Conqueror***
* Complete Mission 50 in Xtreme Mode.<br>

**Notes:** There are achievements for completing 20, 30, and 40 as well. This is just the highest number that the set goes with.

As mentioned above, Xtreme Mode is an arcade-like endurance test. After each mission the enemies’ stats will slowly increase until they cap at Mission 50, after which they’re equivalent to enemies on 5-star difficulty stages on Chaos. 

In order to keep up with the powerscaling, here are a few tips:

1. Pick a character who is capable of managing large groups of enemies with AoEs and also has charge attacks naturally augmented with Fire, such as **Lu Bu** and **Gan Ning.** **Ling Tong** is also an excellent choice if you can manage his speed.

2. Spend the first missions farming as much iron and gold as possible and using the blacksmith to max out your weapon’s Power stat as fast as possible. Iron is dropped by enemy officers and can be found in crates during missions.

3. Hire your first allies as fast as possible by using the shop or recruiting them during missions. **Make sure you keep them alive**. Allies in this mode only get stronger with every mission you complete. Allies hired in much later missions will be useless as they start with no stats and will very quickly get bodied.

4. When doing the special mission for establishing your own kingdom, **do not bring more than one ally**. This is because every ally you bring into this mission will split up from you and eventually get ambushed by high morale units. You really only have time to save one of them while the others get captured and leave your party, wiping all their stat gains.

5. Before hiring an officer, use the Koei Wiki to check what abilities they have. **Never hire an officer with the Revolt ability unless you have another officer with the Suppress ability.** It’s worth hiring officers with the Doctor ability since they will have a chance to heal the entire party a small amount after a mission, even if they’re in reserve. This chance stacks if you have multiple allies with it.<br><br>Generally you want to hire Wu officers, since most of them have attacks that are naturally augmented with Fire. **Zhou Yu** has the Doctor ability and another ability to randomly give you Musou Rage tokens, making him by far the best support for the battlefield and for reserve. **Avoid recruiting Huang Gai though**, since his bombs can hurt you and your allies too.<br><br> Also, **never hire Zhang Jiao.** If you do, his objective will be removed from the mission lineup, which is your best source of free healing.

6. On rare occasions with missions leading to blacksmiths, it will mention that there’s an ‘exceptional craftsman’. This guy is the only way you can buy element augments for your weapon. He will sell only one element and it’s random, costing anywhere from 2,000 to 3,000 iron.<br><br> Fire element is immensely helpful for later missions where the enemies gain a metric ton of HP and Defense. If you’re using a character who already has Fire attacks in their moveset however, Light or Ice are also useful.

7. **Only buy the shop’s Meat Buns as a last resort.** Every Meat Bun you buy will increase the cost of the next shop’s Meat Buns and can get ridiculously expensive if you’re not careful. Health can freely be gotten from optional objectives, random events, and rarely found in crates.

***Xtreme Mode Items***<br>


**Notes:** There are achievements for getting one of each Xtreme Mode item for the first time. These are one-time use and provide you with a buff for the next mission you start. 

To obtain them you have to select missions with the description of ‘There are rumors that somebody here has the [item name]’ and then approach a specific officer who will then give you an objective to do, and will give you the item once you help them. Objective officers also have a random chance of appearing even if the mission doesn’t say anything about them. Objective officers will usually be isolated from whatever conflict is happening in the stage, so they're easy to spot.

Of particular note is the **Wind Guard** because it seems to be exponentially rarer than the other items. Fortunately since you can only have one of each item at a time, you can force it to be rolled as a reward if you acquire every other item and never use them.

***Recruiter***
* Recruit an officer during a mission.<br>

**Notes:** Officers who give you objectives in a mission will have a random chance of joining you once you help them. You can also capture officers who are stated to be ‘patrolling the area’, who are defending Bandit Chiefs, and who are defending villages.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Manacles" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82276003-58a7-4693-b248-502138564c8d" /><br>
***Shackled***
* Complete a mission with the Manacles active.<br>

Notes: Randomly appears in the shop and ‘limits your abilities’ in exchange for an extra 1,000 gold at the end of the stage. I actually don’t know what exactly gets limited here, so let me know if you do.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Dragon Seal" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/971637cc-13e2-41cc-ab18-e5d079d13e9a" /><br>
***Worth Its Weight***
* Receive a 300 point bonus from the Dragon Seal during a mission.<br>

**Notes:** Randomly appears in the shop. This gives you a base 100 gold for getting 50 KOs, and increments that amount by 100 gold for every 50 additional KOs you get. You need at least 100 KOs to get this achievement.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Escort Merchant" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fd12134-404e-481f-b9bf-36bedb87f045" /><br>
***Protection Money***
* Successfully escort a merchant.<br>

Notes: Randomly appears in the shop. All you need to do is finish the main objective of the mission while the merchant is alive.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Rescue Zhang Jiao" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/553c5b20-c15f-46d5-bfc3-76c2d6a8128b" /><br>
***Savior of the Savior***
* Rescue Zhang Jiao and receive his blessing during a mission.<br>

**Notes:** A mission description will let you know if he’s in that particular stage, but he can also have a chance to appear on any stage with a castle in it. Kill the officer guarding the gate of the base he’s trapped in and then run up to him. He’ll heal you and your nearby allies for 200 HP and give you the achievement. Praise be to Heaven!

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Establish Country" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2fdf0a-39bc-447f-80ce-d799ef307214" /><br>
***Independence Day***
* Found your own country.<br>

**Notes:** Once you get to Mission 10, you will have the option to choose a special mission to invade a land and declare your own country there. Once completed, if you go to a shop located in your country’s stage (indicated by a flag icon), the prices of everything will be reduced.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Escort Craftsman" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7d9b6fc-6452-4444-aa16-4458fe60c5e8" /><br>
***The Muscle***
* Successfully escort a craftsman.<br>

Notes: Randomly appears in the shop after you found your country. Same deal as the merchant. Once completed you will unlock a facility which will provide you with a passive benefit for the rest of the playthrough.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Upgraded Country" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/371ae982-e2fd-4749-824a-7c0deaa8dccc" /><br>
***First World***
* Fully upgrade your country.<br>

**Notes:** To do this you must complete the ‘Escort Craftsman’ objective 4 times to max out your country’s size. This is luck dependent, just buy Escort Craftsman whenever you see it in a shop.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Peasant" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8bdc135-7212-434e-94b9-6af94f83d779" /><br>
***Got Your Cut***
* Collect tax from desperate peasants.<br>

**Notes:** This is a random event that can occur after a mission if you have your own country and the game determines you to be a Chaotic Ruler.

There is a hidden stat in this mode called ‘alignment’, which determines whether you’re a Noble or Chaotic Ruler. Killing Village Elders and capturing female officers in bandit missions will decrease it, while helping officers with objectives, rescuing female officers from bandits, and rescuing villages from raiders will increase it.

It’s highly recommended that you do this on a throwaway run because a negative alignment will just make the rest of your run harder. Not only are revolts more likely to happen, but you will also have a chance to be ambushed by an enraged officer during missions. Officers that are enraged will have a strange wavy red and blue aura around them and they will hit much harder than usual.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Unify your country" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/005ed90d-15f9-4806-9328-48b52579c218" /><br>
***Grand Unifier***
* Fully unify your country.<br>

**Notes:** To do this you must max out your country’s Unification at 100. Completing special ‘invade a neighboring kingdom’ missions will raise it by 20, while ignoring invasions and revolts in your own country will reduce it by 20. One of these mission types will appear every 5 missions after founding your country. Revolts are more likely to happen if you have a negative alignment value and/or have allies with the Revolt ability who are at low affinity.

This is largely luck dependent, but also requires skill. Make sure you are healed up at least one mission in advance, because special missions are more difficult than the others, with the final Unification mission being particularly nasty because of how many enraged officers will attack you. Make sure you keep your alignment positive by helping officers and not raiding villages. **Do not bring any allies to these missions that you aren’t willing to lose**, since they are likely to be defeated by other officers.


<h2 id=DestinyMode>V: Destiny Mode</h2>



Another new mode and exclusive to this particular game. This is essentially a career mode, where you make a custom character and then take them through a total of 8 stages, improving them as you go by fulfilling stage objectives to gain points and then spending them to unlock skills. After completing the playthrough they can be transferred to Edit Mode with a weapon you obtained during it.

The officer you choose to serve under will determine what stages you play, what weapon you will obtain by impressing them, and can affect your character build by giving you certain types of skills for free. The last point is documented on the [Koei Wiki](https://koei.fandom.com/wiki/Dynasty_Warriors_5:_Xtreme_Legends/Destiny_Mode) and may be useful to you for certain achievements.

Most of these achievements are just fulfilling the types of objectives for the first time and finishing a playthrough with all skills of a particular type. These are all self-explanatory so I won’t go over them. Instead I’ll be going over promotions and also how to get the outfits, since those can be cryptic and hard to get.

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Lt General" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d970f168-e1ad-4b21-a27d-862b7814d0aa" /><br>
***Stars***
* Be promoted to Lieutenant General.<br>

**Notes:** You must be promoted to Sergeant, Major, and then to Lt. General.

You have a chance to be rewarded with a promotion, a free skill, and/or a weapon after a stage by your unit commander, with a much higher probability depending on how many ‘Good’ ratings you obtained on the stage’s rating screen. These are separated into Military, Strategy, and Contribution.

**Military:** The amount of KOs you get and officers you defeat.

**Strategy:** The amount of KOs as a result of or assisted by Tactics skills, ie. ambushes and setting fire to bases.

**Contribution:** The amount of KOs, defeated officers, and time/activity spent within the vicinity of your unit commander.

Note that finishing a stage after fulfilling the Betrayal objective will always be treated as though you got all 3 Good ratings, regardless of what the rating screen actually says.

***Light Armor***
* Obtain Charge, Health Level 1, and Sergeant rank.<br>

**Notes:** Requires at least 40 skill points and 1 promotion.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Leather Jerkin" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85dc1f91-4e49-4d50-855c-ab8d9f80c0f1" /><br>
***Leather Jerkin/Combat Dress***
* Obtain any skill from both the Archery and Search categories, and Sergeant rank.<br>

**Notes:** Requires at least 40 skill points and 1 promotion.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Heavy Armor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32d2a4e6-58c2-4775-b028-533b2080450b" /><br>
***Heavy Armor***
* Obtain Musou, Health Level 2, Plate Mail or Basic Mount, and Major rank.<br>

**Notes:** Requires at least 150 skill points and 2 promotions.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Tactical Robe" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/940b7ec8-4048-4054-ba8b-7a4f0aaba03c" /><br>
***Tactical Robe/Dancer’s Robe***
* Obtain 2 skills from both the Leader and Search categories, and Major rank.<br>

**Notes:** Requires at least 140 skill points and 2 promotions.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Strategist Robe" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12486442-f433-4d18-ab9a-92c5ff284f97" /><br>
***Strategist Robe/Regal Dress***
* Obtain 2 skills from both the Leader and Tactics categories, and Major rank.<br>

**Notes:** Requires at least 200 skill points and 2 promotions.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Fur Skin" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c04259ce-275a-4d22-bd41-95437be07e7b" /><br>
***Fur Skin/Nanman Dress***
* Finish a stage with a bad Contribution rating.<br>

**Notes:** This is actually pretty easy to do, just run away from your unit commander on Stage 1 and go straight to Zhang Bao. You can fall in with another unit of allies to make the fight easier since you are very weak to start off with.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Grand Armor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c0e7d25-78f2-4998-986b-a789cfe34856" /><br>
***Grand Armor/Maiden Armor***
* Obtain Rage, Health Level 3, any two out of Advanced Mount/March/Rally, and Lt. General rank.<br>

**Notes:** Requires at least 400 skill points and 3 promotions.

This is by far the hardest outfit to get because of the amount of skill points you need. You will *really* struggle to get 400 points in a run, especially if you get unlucky with objectives.

I recommend picking a unit commander that has a chance to give you Leader skills for free once you get Major rank, since those are the most expensive skills. Doing the Betrayal objective twice will also give you a total of 140 points, but this is luck dependent and you won’t be able to control who your unit commander will be.

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Prime Minister Robe" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e2286ca-5710-4f3c-84c3-0f02fdc44335" /><br>
***Prime Minister Robe/Sacred Gown***
* Obtain a total of 6 skills from the Leader, Tactics, and Search categories, and Lt. General rank.<br>

**Notes:** Requires at least 240 skill points and 3 promotions.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Demon Armor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5502a5f-8474-4514-8f1c-f09ca6c59c0e" /><br>
***Demon’s Armor***
* As a **male character**, get a total of 1,500 KOs across all 8 stages.<br>

**Notes:** Choose a character whose weapon gives you a wide AoE as your unit commander, or you have a chance to obtain Lu Bu’s weapon from Supply Captains, which will give you an excellent crowd control tool with C3. Try to aim for at least 200-300 KOs per stage in the latter half of the playthrough. You will obtain the armor after the 8th stage ends.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Sorceress Gown" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd04e80a-0c08-4cee-b8d7-f38d3af86a46" /><br>
***Sorceress Gown***
* As a **female character**, complete at least one stage for all of the Three Kingdoms.<br>

**Notes:** This requires you to defect twice. You have a chance of triggering a defection event by performing well in stages, and the unit commander you can defect to will be based on certain actions you took during that stage, ie. killing a lot of soldiers or burning a lot of bases. You cannot defect back to a previous kingdom that you betrayed.

<h2 id=ChaosDifficulty>VI: Chaos Difficulty</h2>

We have arrived at the ultimate challenge and what you did all that stat, 4th weapon, and item grinding for. Chaos throws much denser swarms of stronger and tankier enemies your way and makes them attack ruthlessly, enemy commanders are turbocharged to withstand as many hits as possible, and on top of all of that your methods for healing during the stage are limited. Supply bases and enemies will no longer drop health, and you will only rarely get drops of 50 HP from pots near checkpoints.

Also, no interim saves. Hardcore users weep.

There are achievements for completing every character’s Musou Mode and the much harder Legend Mode stages on Chaos, as well as completing certain objectives and triggering special stage events on Chaos. I will only go over the objectives and stage events.

However, first I will provide some general tips on how to survive this difficulty.

———<br>

### Item Builds<br>

———<br>

1. **The Fire Orb is your main source of DPS.** Officers and commanders, especially on harder stages, will have an excessive amount of HP and Defense. Inflicting an enemy with Fire will ignore their Defense and reduce their HP at a continuous fast rate as long as they’re stunned or being juggled in the air.<br><br>This is why launch charge attacks are incredibly important to a character’s moveset, and why the easier you can theoretically trap the enemy in an infinite juggle, the easier a time you’ll have clearing Chaos with them.<br><br>If a character has a launch or stun that is naturally augmented with Fire, such as Gan Ning or Ling Tong, you may consider running another orb on them instead. The same goes for Huang Zhong if you decide to run Fire Arrows on him.

2. **Your harness should be Shadow Harness.** This prevents you from getting knocked off of any mount by enemies or projectiles, making it extremely useful. Just be aware that your DPS is reduced massively while on horseback, even with horse stat buffs, so you’ll mostly be using this as a defensive tool against groups of enemies.

3. **Always make sure you’re running a maxed out Tiger Amulet and Tortoise Amulet.** Tiger Amulet raises your Attack, and Tortoise Amulet is mandatory if you don’t want to die after only a few hits.

4. **Arm Guards** is flat out essential for characters who have long startup delays on their charge attacks, like Cao Pi, Xu Zhu, and the Heavy 4th weapon users. 

5. **Ginseng** is a useful item because it makes your Musou gauge fill more for each hit on an enemy. You will frequently be using your Musou as an emergency ‘get away from me’ button on Chaos.

6. **Wind Scroll** is incredibly useful for most characters, since it expands the hitbox of your attacks and in some characters’ cases even allows them to circumvent an enemy’s guard and hit them with an AoE from the front, but it’s actually a hindrance for midrange melee movesets like Zhao Yun and Yueying. Wind Scroll will displace their launch attacks instead of expanding them, making them almost always whiff. It’s best to test it on each character first, and remove it if you find that your launch is missing a lot.

7. With characters who do not get a Life boost from their 4th weapon, you may want to consider running a maxed out **Peacock Amulet**, especially if they need to play long and difficult stages like Wu Zhang Plains or He Fei Castle.

8. **Dragon Arms** is a more niche item that is best used on characters that can combo its effect with their jump charge to give them a lot of mobility or coverage. Notable users of it include Yuan Shao (C1 > JC), Meng Huo (C1 > JC), Pang Tong (any > JC), and Huang Zhong (any > JC), but it’s best for you to experiment and see who it works best with.

9. **Way of Musou** always makes your Musou the True Musou variant, and is particularly useful for characters whose True Musous gives their attacks Fire damage, large AoEs, and/or makes them invincible for a long time. There are characters like Zhurong whose normal Musou is flat out just better than their True Musou though, so only run this if you really depend on it, especially if that item slot is best used on something more important.

### Tips and Warnings

———<br>

1. **Your bodyguard should be a Superior Fan user.** I mentioned this way back in the Preparation section and this is what it’s for.<br><br>Fan bodyguards are your only renewable source of healing on Chaos (Tribal Remedy doesn’t exist, shut up). If you’re standing next to them and they’re currently engaged in combat, they will have a chance to heal you for 50 HP. If you desperately need health, it’s best to find some enemy stragglers and guard against them for a bit to proc some heals. You could also run **Vampire Arms** and parry them if you’re a true gamer.<br><br>A nice bonus is if they have Wall and Heal to make them survive in the stage longer, and Fame to make raising morale easier.

2. **Use the Morale system to your full advantage.** It’s simply way too risky to take on every enemy unit that you see, especially on higher difficulty stages. Instead, lower your enemies’ morale and raise your allies’ morale by getting KOs and fulfilling stage objectives, and when the ally’s morale is 2-3 stars higher than that of the unit they’re engaged with, simply leave that area and the ally will eventually defeat the enemy unit offscreen with barely any mess.<br><br>Note that **this doesn’t work** for enemy officers that are treated as ‘boss encounters’ (are given a small introductory cutscene when you approach them and are enraged). This also goes for the enemy commander. The most the allies can do to them offscreen is take out the enemies and guard unit around them, but this is still very useful because it allows you and your allies to pile onto them  uninterrupted and not give them any chances to recover.<br><br>That being said, you still want to take out reinforcement units if they spawn nearby with high morale and are approaching an allied unit, since they can quickly mow down your forces if ignored. 

3. **Never loiter outside an enemy attack base.** Getting hit by one of their projectiles will shave off a massive chunk of your HP. If you’re engaged in a fight near one, make sure you run inside the base first so that you’re not at risk of getting hit. This also goes for running past or behind general stage hazards like boulders and arbalests.

4. **Keep away from archer towers.** No, I don’t mean the archers. I mean the towers themselves. If you knock one down and get trapped underneath it when it falls, **you will lose half your HP**. It’s easy to do this accidentally because they are *everywhere* in camps. It’s best to knock them down beforehand if you know you’re going to be fighting an officer or a group of enemies near one.

5. **Do not solo unless it’s necessary.** You will very quickly get swept if you do this on high difficulty stages, especially if there’s more than one officer. Always make sure there are allies nearby that you can use as buffers or as support, and secure checkpoints whenever you see them nearby. There are exceptions where you are expected to solo like in Guan Yu’s Escape and Trials of Sun Ce; in those cases you should take things slowly and not rush into the fray.

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Xi Liang - Zhang Jiao - summon rolling column and phantom army" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88a00967-a20e-48ae-8019-d88a5706b1ae" /><br>
***Conjuror***
* As Zhang Jiao with the Yellow Turbans, summon a rolling stone column and phantom army during the Battle of Xi Liang on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Capture the neutral base close to you and then rescue Zhang Liang by defeating Li Ru. He will run to the base and summon the stone column. Rescue him again by defeating Ma Chao when he spawns, and then capture or run into the northwestern attack base once Zhang Jiao says “The Heavens are with us” to summon the phantom army.

***Unconjuror***
* As Dong Zhuo with Dong Zhuo’s forces, dispel the boulder attack, rolling column, and phantom army in the Battle of Xi Liang on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Defeat Cheng Yuanzhi, Zhang Liang, and Zhang Bao.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Ji Province - Zhao Yun - stop the tornadoes" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1029e71-f3aa-425d-a656-7166d6fda641" /><br>
***Broke Wind***
* As Zhao Yun with Yuan Shao’s forces, dispel the tornadoes during the Battle of Ji Province on Chaos.<br>

***F5***
* As Zhang Jiao with the Yellow Turbans, summon and fully strengthen a tornado, then march on Yuan Shao during the Battle of Ji Province on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Capture the altar in the center of the stage by killing the Defense Captain, and then stay on it so that Zhang Jiao summons the tornado. Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang will then eventually head towards the altar to strengthen them. Make sure you protect them and the altar by defeating the officers surrounding them.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Liang Province - Pang De refuses to defect" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6683ced-0ba7-4722-9fd3-87b29fce3323" /><br>
***Loyalty***
* As Pang De with Allied forces, refuse Hua Xiong’s proposal to defect during the Battle of Liang Province on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Get 300 KOs, and then approach Hua Xiong who’s in front of the southeastern enemy camp. A cutscene will play afterwards. **Make sure you let all of the post-cutscene dialogue play**, since you won’t get the achievement if you kill him while it’s still playing.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Battle for Nan Zhong - Zhang Jiao converts all villages" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47515385-458f-46ee-b780-814f9a69c7c7" /><br>
***Spread the Good Word***
* As Zhang Jiao with the Yellow Turbans, convert all three villages during the Battle of Nan Zhong on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Unfortunately this is another long and difficult Zhang Jiao stage. Now that the groans are out of the way, you need to defeat King Duosi, King Mulu, and Wu Tugu. King Duosi is in the swamp right in front of where you spawn and is annoying because of the poison effect. Just head for one of the inner islands and try to stay on it.

Afterwards you have the option to take your army to either King Mulu or Wu Tugu by heading through one of the opened gates. No matter which one you choose though, Zhurong and the sub-officer of the other officer you ignored will launch an ambush on Zhang Liang back in the swamp. Take both of them out to save him and then go back and capture the second village.

Head to the third village afterwards and kill the final officer, and you should get the achievement after all of the info bar text.

***Spell Breaker***
* As any character with Han forces, dispel the boulder attack, tornado, brainwashing spell, and phantom army during the Yellow Turban Rebellion on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Defeat Zhang Liang, Zhang Bao, and Zhang Mancheng to dispel their magic, and then destroy the braziers in the enemy camp to dispel the phantoms. Note that you have to wait until Sun Jian’s unit is brainwashed before defeating Zhang Mancheng in order to make it count.

***Exit Stage Left***
* As either Liu Bei, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, Dian Wei, or Xu Zhu with Allied forces, be saved from Lu Bu by a close comrade during the Battle of Hu Lao Gate on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Make Lu Bu spawn by killing Hu Lao’s Gate Captain or waiting a little while, and then approach Lu Bu to make his boss cutscene play. You’ll trigger another cutscene once you’ve hung around Lu Bu for a little bit. **You do not need to fight him.**

***Fooled ‘Em***
* As Lu Bu with Yuan Shao’s forces, regain Yuan Shao’s trust during the Battle of Chang Shan on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Kill Zhang Yan once you get ambushed and Yuan Shao refuses to send you reinforcements. Do **not** go down the eastern path towards the three lines of officers, or you’ll fail to regain his trust.

—

***Played Into His Hands***
* As Sun Jian with Sun Jian’s forces, evade Huang Zu’s ambush and then defeat him during the Battle of Jing Province on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Go forward and approach Huang Zu, and then just keep following him to the western castle gates. You’ll get an alternative cutscene where Sun Jian anticipates and thwarts the ambush. Defeat him afterwards.

***Tis But a Flesh Wound***
* As Xiahou Dun with Cao Cao’s forces, take an arrow to the eye during the Battle of Xia Pi on Chaos.<br>

* As Guan Yu with Cao Cao’s forces, defeat Yan Liang during the Battle of Guan Du on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory.

**Burn It Down**
* As Cao Pi with Cao Cao’s forces, get Zhang He to defect during the Battle of Guan Du on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Keep fighting until Yuan Shao orders Wu Chao to be opened, and then go to the center of the stage and kill the officer within it to set it on fire. Zhang He will defect soon after. Just make sure you don’t accidentally kill him before then.

***Mysterious Message***
* As Zuo Ci with Yuan Shao’s forces, inform Guan Yu of Liu Bei’s presence during the Battle of Guan Du on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Just approach Guan Yu. It’s best to do this first so you can save Yan Liang and Wen Chou.

—

***U Mad Bro?***
* As Xiahou Dun with Cao Cao’s forces, destroy the carriage, enraging Guan Yu and then complete Guan Yu’s Escape on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory, but be careful because Guan Yu will become enraged. It’s best to clear out all the other officers in the stage first and then destroy the carriage when he’s at very low health so that you’ll have an easier time.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Xia Kou - Gan Ning successfully completes the fleet attack" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50352994-b559-458e-bf17-328741a6b3a9" /><br>
***Seafarer***
* As Gan Ning with Huang Zu’s forces, successfully land the fleet attack at Sun Quan’s camp during the Battle of Xia Kou on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** There are several conditions to make the fleet attack happen: Cai Mao must be alive, you must defeat all of the enemy units excluding Zhou Yu and Sun Quan, and a set amount of time must have passed. You’ll get the achievement once the fleet docks at Sun Quan’s camp.

***Bearer of Good News***
* As Zhao Yun with Liu Bei’s forces, inform Liu Bei that his child has been saved during the Battle of Chang Ban on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** You spawn at the northwestern corner of the stage. Just ride up to Liu Bei and you’ll get the achievement after a short dialogue.

—

***All Else Failed***
* As Zhuge Liang with Liu Bei’s forces, launch the fire attack during the Battle of Chang Ban on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Immediately go and capture the northernmost neutral base before the enemy gets to it first, or the fire attack will be cancelled. Defeat Zhu Ling, Li Dian, and Yu Jin as they approach so that the Task Leaders are safe.

—

***Never Too Late***
* As Zhuge Liang with Liu Bei’s forces, deploy two ambush units during the Battle of Chang Ban on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Approach Liu Bei once he halts his advance in the southwestern corner of the stage, and then the ambush units will spawn after the cutscene. Make sure to do this before Liu Qi spawns.

—

* As Zhang Liao, Xu Huang, or Xiahou Dun with Cao Cao’s forces, capture Zhao Yun during the Battle of Chang Ban on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Zhao Yun spawns in the northwestern corner of the stage. Defeat him before he reaches Liu Bei.

***Headed Off***
* As Ma Chao or Pang De with the Allied forces, foil Cao Cao’s plans to cross the river during the Battle of Tong Gate on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** This one is very obscure; it’s not about knocking Cao Cao off his horse. Before Cao Cao sets off on his own, you have to make him abandon the river plan entirely by heading out of Tong Gate’s north entrance and then crossing the bridge. Cao Cao will see you and then panic and hole himself up in the enemy camp for the rest of the stage.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Tong Gate - Ma Chao defeats Xu Zhu" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/868dba9d-83fe-4659-b27b-6c6cd904c427" /><br>

***Payback***
* As Ma Chao or Pang De with the Allied Forces, make Han Sui pay for his treachery during the Battle of Tong Gate on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** You have to let Cao Cao cross the river and wait until he’s approaching the northwestern side of the stage. Jia Xu will start talking about a plan to make Cao Cao and Han Sui reconcile. Once Cao Cao and Han Sui start having dialogue with each other and a cutscene plays of them hanging out, approach Han Sui and another cutscene will play. Kill him once he defects.

***Key Crossing***
* As Sun Shangxiang, Lu Meng, Lu Xun, or Zhou Tai with Wu forces, thwart the Nanman bridge sabotage during the Invasion of Nan Zhong on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Head past the southeastern attack base and Meng Huo will launch beast units onto the camp, and a Task Leader will appear at the central bridge right after. You have a few minutes to kill the Task Leader and save the bridge.

—

***In the Nick of TIme***
* As Sun Shangxiang or Lu Xun with Wu forces, rescue Sun Quan after he is ambushed during the Invasion of Nan Zhong on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** This time you have to ignore the Task Leader and let the bridge get destroyed, and then approach Sun Quan afterwards. You can just simply go to your camp and stay there killing the enemies until then.

***Mystery Mountaineer***
* As Xu Zhu with Wei forces, meet and defeat Zuo Ci during the Battle of Mt. Ding Jun on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory. Zuo Ci will ignore you and eventually leave the stage on his own, so you will actively have to track him down and defeat him.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Conquest of Nan Zhong - Zhuge Liang, Diao Chan, Huang Zhong, Wei Yan, Yue Ying discover all 3 shortcuts" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5048149b-7f96-4b1a-87e8-5d2dc9821ac7" /><br>
***Legend of the Hidden Temples***
* As Zhuge Liang, Diaochan, Huang Zhong, Wei Yan, or Yueying with Shu forces, find all three shortcuts during the Conquest of Nan Zhong on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** On the Shu side of the stage, these paths will be invisible on the minimap until you find and walk over them. There’s one connecting the entire south side of the stage to the poison swamp, one connecting the center-east to the center-north, and one connecting the armor troop area to the center-north. Refer to the Nanman side of the stage if you have trouble locating them, since they will be automatically registered on the minimap there.

***Savagery***
* As Wei Yan with Shu forces, defeat Jiang Wei during the Battle of Tian Shui on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Note that this doesn’t count if you capture both of the castles and make Jiang Wei pull back. You have to ignore Zhuge Liang’s plan and defeat him as soon as the stage starts. Fun fact: this is where the glitched ‘Dummy’ dialogue comes from!

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Chen Can - Cao Ren destroys siege ramp" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cf5192e-e7e2-43c4-b0d4-9e82e0bfb9b8" /><br>
***Siege Breaker***
* As Cao Ren with Wei forces, destroy an advancing siege ramp during the Battle of Chen Cang on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Just ride down to the area below the castle and destroy one of the ramps.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="He Fei Castle - Cao Pi, Zhen Ji, Sima Yi, Xu Zhu destroy 2 siege rams" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e795d70b-b229-46af-a189-7cdb51a5f2fb" /><br>
***Flat Tires***
* As Cao Pi, Zhenji, Sima Yi, or Xu Zhu with Wei forces, destroy both rams during the Battle of He Fei Castle on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** The first ram is present upon starting the stage, and the second ram will only spawn once the Wu fleet arrives and the first ram is destroyed. They will head towards the inner gate on the south side of the castle.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="He Fei Castle - Xu Zhu defeats Zuo Ci" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/522acbfc-ad7b-4424-9963-86e0893ba5ce" /><br>
***Mysterious Sieger***
* As Xu Zhu with Wei forces, confront and defeat Zuo Ci during the Battle of He Fei Castle on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Zuo Ci will spawn a couple of minutes into the stage near your spawn location, and will begin chasing you down to attack you. It’s **highly recommended** you stay near the allied units so that you’re not potentially stranded with him and another officer, since unfortunately Xu Zhu’s slow speed and long windups make him a *very* bad matchup against even generic officers on Chaos, let alone Zuo Ci.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="He Fei Castle - Sun Quan, Lu Xun, Taishi Ci breach the castle walls with the rams" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccdb9b0f-7738-414c-94d8-91422a7eda1b" /><br>
***Breach the Gates***
* As Sun Quan, Lu Xun, or Taishi Ci with Wu forces, destroy the castle gates with the rams during the Battle of He Fei Castle on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** The catapults will destroy the ram on the first attempt, so you have to infiltrate the castle and kill both of the Defense Captains on the walls. Be careful when attacking the one on the western wall, since you can knock him off into the lower area to the south and lose sight of him entirely. Also make sure Xu Huang is dead so that he doesn’t keep destroying the rams afterwards.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="He Fei Castle - Lu Xun defeats Zhen Ji" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c7ebc2b-7bd3-4383-b92d-6e0a1996bf50" /><br>
***The Queen is Dead***
* As Lu Xun with Wu forces, defeat Zhenji during the Battle of He Fei Castle on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Zhenji is Cao Pi’s sub-officer in this stage. Once you approach Xu Zhu, Zhenji will create a path around the castle with a rockslide and begin charging towards Sun Quan. Make sure you catch and take her out **immediately** since she will have maxed out morale and will be enraged.

***Hero of the People***
* As Ma Chao with Shu forces, rescue the peasant militia during the Battle of Bai Di Castle on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** A peasant militia will spawn in the village on the southwestern part of the stage a couple of minutes in. Make sure you wait until the info bar states that Ma Chao is heading to rescue the peasant militia before you go to them, otherwise the rescue will not trigger.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Bai Di Castle - Sun Quan, Lu Xun, Huang Gai, Zhou Tai stop rockslide" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e5fae85-7b92-430e-a021-130792071a9d" /><br>
***Aggro Crag***
* As Sun Quan, Lu Xun, Huang Gai, or Zhou Tai with Wu forces, stop the rockslide during the Battle of Bai Di Castle on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** The rockslide will happen either once you or your allies approach Huang Zhong from the north, or when he goads Huang Gai into attacking him. Kill him to stop the rockslide.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Bai Di Castle - Zhou Tai rescues Sun Quan" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/405743d6-f14c-420f-80ef-ddf3baa1e78c" /><br>
***Rising Sun***
* As Zhou Tai with Wu forces, rendezvous with Sun Quan after Ma Chao’s ambush during the Battle of Bai Di Castle on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** You do not need to kill Ma Chao once he spawns. Just approach Sun Quan when it happens and you’ll get a cutscene.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Bai Di Castle - Sun Quan, Lu Xun, Huang Gai, Zhou Tai clear maze" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2061c10e-a3b6-4b28-b853-1bf8cdc9ac46" /><br>
***Brainiac***
* As Sun Quan, Lu Xun, Huang Gai, or Zhou Tai with Wu forces, clear the Stone Sentinel Maze during the Battle of Bai Di Castle on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** You have to go to the center of the maze, destroy the statue there, and then kill all of the tanky Shu soldiers that spawn.

***Not a Trebuchet***
* As Sima Yi or Cao Ren with Wei forces, deploy the catapults during the Battle of Wu Zhang Plains on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Zhong Hui will spawn to the west of your camp after Deng Ai arrives, and then Zhuge Liang will set an ambush unit upon him. You have to kill the ambush unit’s officer so that Zhong Hui will run into the camp, and then the catapults will be set up soon after.

—

***Cold Turkey***
* As Sima Yi or Cao Ren with Wei forces, cut off the Shu supply line during the Battle of Wu Zhang Plains on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** The checkpoint at the far center-east of the stage has a Defense Captain in front of it. Kill him to cut off the wood oxen.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Wu Zhang Plains - Cao Cao defeats Zuo Ci" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd1a6cdf-5e49-4c34-962f-c13541cd5949" /><br>
***Rise From Your Grave***
* As Cao Cao with Wei forces, meet and defeat Zuo Ci during the Battle of Wu Zhang Plains on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Zuo Ci appears almost as soon as you start the stage. If you’re doing this on Musou Mode, it’s recommended that you take out the ambush unit and Wang Ping first to ensure that Zhong Hui sets up the catapults.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Wu Zhang Plains - Yue Ying bring wood oxen to frontlines" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbea7c86-ea8b-44f7-addb-97da00216d99" /><br>
***Bovine Bravery***
* As Yueying with Shu forces, deliver the wood oxen to the frontlines during the Battle of Wu Zhang Plains on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Start by taking out the officers, soldiers, and guard checkpoint in the center-west, and also clear out the center-southwest of the stage where the oxen will spawn. Then go back to where you spawned and kill Guo Huai to summon the oxen. You’ll get the achievement once one of the oxen makes it to the frontlines. Note that you can fail this objective if too many of them are destroyed.

***Well Read***
* As Zhang Jiao, Pang Tong or Zuo Ci, be the first to enter the castle during the Struggle for the Book on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** You must eliminate all of the enemies on your pathway up to the castle in order to impress Master Lao, and then you must defeat the Master Lao phantom at the castle gate in order to enter. **You have a limited time to do this before the other two characters get to the castle first.**

***Brothers at First Sight***
* As Guan Yu or Zhang Fei, enlist the aid of a worthy comrade during the Rescue of Lou Sang Village on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** If playing as Guan Yu, approach Zhang Fei. If playing as Zhang Fei, approach Guan Yu. You’ll get the achievement after the cutscene.

***Explosive Entrance***
* As Huang Gai, infiltrate the castle and open both gates during Ou Xing’s Rebellion on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** As Huang Gai you’ll spawn in the southeastern corner of the stage. Go towards the castle on the west path and either snipe or ride past the infantry guards. Once inside the castle, kill the western and eastern Gate Captains.

—

***Time to Rage***
* As Dian Wei or Xu Zhu, vow to protect your comrade from Lu Bu during the Imperial Rescue on Chaos.<br>

Notes: To get this cutscene, you have to approach and trigger Lu Bu’s boss cutscene while also being close to Xu Zhu or Dian Wei at the same time, depending on who you’re playing as. Cao Cao will send the one you’re not playing as directly to him when he spawns, so just follow him there.

***Greener Pastures***
* As Zhang Fei, Zhuge Liang or Wei Yan, get Ma Chao to defect during the Battle of Jia Meng Gate on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Start by killing the two Guard Captains in the southeastern part of the stage before the reinforcements arrive to decrease Zhang Lu’s trust in Ma Chao, and then defeat Ma Dai who is nearby to reduce it further. Once Zhuge Liang remarks on the frail bond between Zhang Lu and Ma Chao, go and defeat Ma Chao to make him flee. Defeat him again once he reappears to make him defect.

***Super Aggro Crag***

***Dockhand***
* As Gan Ning, successfully dock both Wu ships during the Battle of Ru Xu Kou on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** To dock the first ship you must kill all of Cao Ren’s sub-officers in the center of the stage, and then the ship will spawn on the west side shortly afterwards.

To dock the second ship you must take the first ship’s shortcut to the west side of the stage, and then head to the island to the north, to the jutting out part where the path ends. You cannot be seen by any enemy officers during this part or the plan will fail, but regular soldiers are fine.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Han Shui - Huang Zhong - succeed ambushing Wei main camp (XL only)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c6f9e9c-b1ff-40ae-93ad-b7449141a92f" /><br>
***Sniper***
* As Huang Zhong, conduct a successful ambush of Wei’s main camp during the Battle of Han Shui on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** You will spawn on the northwestern corner of the stage. You have to proceed to the bridge on the west side of the enemy camp, taking out all the Defense Captains without letting them see you by shooting them from a distance with your first person bow attack. Break the crates along the road to restock on ammo. You will fail the ambush if you get too close to an enemy or if you get spotted twice in a short time.

This is an *extremely* annoying one because the Defense Captains will move around, despawn if they get too far away, and some of them are positioned very awkwardly. To make matters worse they all take at least three hits to kill on Chaos, making it easy to run out of ammo, and if you get spotted just *once* on this difficulty, which is very easy to do because they can spot you from a mile away, Cao Cao will spawn a rear guard and make the ambush impossible. 

It’s **highly recommended** you equip a maxed out Huang’s Bow, and also Ice Arrows so that you can freeze the Defense Captains on hit and make them much easier to kill.

***Master Saboteur***
* As Lu Xun, destroy three bridges to completely thwart Wei’s strategy during the Battle of Shi Ting on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** **Do not approach the enemy camp or the open area where Cao Xiu is.**

Start by taking out Xiahou Hui and Zhang Hu right in front of you, and then turn around and head southwest to take out Xiahou Ba, or just wait until Sun Shangxiang does it herself. 

Next, capture the base in the northeastern corner of the stage. It’s best to let Shangxiang capture the southwestern base while you focus on taking out the officers that will charge at Sun Quan. **Make sure you also take out the Task Leader that spawns in your main camp**. Once you capture both bases, Zhou Fang will defect and destroy the first bridge.

Sima Yi will then begin his plan to summon enemy reinforcements from your camp. As long as you killed the Task Leader beforehand, the other two bridges should be destroyed immediately.

***Sniffed Out the Rat***
* As Lu Xun, find the traitor during the Battle of Shi Ting on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** A Task Leader will spawn in your main camp and begin heading north once you capture one of the enemy bases. Approach and kill him.

—

<img width="64" height="64" alt="Shi_Ting_-_Lu_Xun_fire_attack_XL_only" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a56d9a4e-32f6-45af-9bcd-af2771f818e6" /><br>
***Burn It All Down***
* As Lu Xun, execute the fire attack during the Battle of Shi Ting on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** You have to do the stage up to where the three bridges are destroyed. Sima Yi will call in Cao Zhen to ambush you from your camp. Once that happens and Lu Xun comments about readying a fire attack, retreat to the narrow path leading to the camp from the west and let the soldiers approach you, and the cutscene should trigger. 

Note that Cao Zhen needs to be alive, otherwise it will not trigger. It can also take a long time for the cutscene to play because it will be backlogged behind all the other info bar text from the Wu forces launching an all-out attack. Just hang around the camp until it happens.

***Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon***
* As Zhuge Liang, execute a successful ambush against the Wei forces during the Battle of Mt. Qi on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Once you lure all three officers into position during the fake retreat and go to your main camp, all of your forces will leave the stage. Zhang He will then send Task Leaders to your camp in order to patrol around and suss out your plan. You have to hide from the Task Leaders for a set amount of time and without leaving the camp. If they see you, the plan will fail.

This achievement can potentially be very frustrating since Dynasty Warriors isn’t exactly known for its stellar stealth sections. My method is to go to the very southwestern corner of the camp and linger behind one of the circular huts there, since the Task Leaders are unlikely to go that far in.

***Cut to the Chase***
* As Meng Huo or Zhurong, cut off the Wei reinforcement path during the Showdown at Nan Zhong on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Sometime during the stage, a soldier will report that Wei reinforcements are gathering from the east. Capture the southeastern checkpoint to cut them off.

***Pachyderm Power***
* As Meng Huo or Zhurong, witness King Mulu destroy the perimeter fences during the Showdown at Nan Zhong on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** After you capture the central area, you then have to either save both of your flank units from Wei’s ambush units **OR** ignore them entirely, and eventually Meng Huo will order King Mulu to break down the fences. If you only save one flank unit, Cao Zhen will arrive as Wei reinforcements and break down the fences with a ram instead.

<h2 id=Misc>VII: Miscellaneous Achievements</h2>

(Achievements that don’t fit into any other category. A lot of these you’ll get naturally during your playthrough like maxing out an officer, maxing out an item, having 3 buffs at the same time, etc. I’ll only cover the ones that are harder to get.)

***The Hard Way***
* Complete any stage on Chaos without using a Musou attack.<br>

**Notes:** Self-explanatory, but keep in mind that proccing Shadow Orb’s effect **does** count as using a Musou attack since it empties the Musou gauge. Activating Musou Rage **does not** count as a Musou attack however.

Very easily achieved by choosing a 1-star difficulty stage and a completely busted character like Lu Bu or Shadow Harness Ma Chao/Zhou Tai.

***Rider of the Pale Horse***
* As Ma Chao, complete the Battle of Bai Di Castle (Shu Forces) on Chaos while equipped with the Shadow Harness and never dismounting.<br>

**Notes:** Speaking of which, this is a neat achievement because it’s just meant to showcase how utterly broken Ma Chao on a horse is. Or as I like to call him: Ma Horse. Have fun with this one!

***Wood Chipper***
* As Guan Yu, while opposing Cao Cao, receive praise for cutting through his troops as though they were fodder on Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** To do this you have to pick any stage where Cao Cao is the enemy commander, get 500 KOs, and then approach him. 

The special dialogue he has for this seems to trigger randomly and won’t even trigger at all in some stages. I personally got this achievement in **Battle of Tong Gate (Allied Forces)**, a 2-star difficulty stage. Others have reported it happening in **Chang Ban** and **Chi Bi**.

***Outshined***
* Complete any stage having less KOs than your bodyguard on either Hard or Chaos.<br>

**Notes:** Play as Sun Ce in the Trials of Sun Ce on Hard. Choose a maxed out Sword bodyguard and equip the **Bodyguard Manual**.

Let your bodyguard kill the Yu Ji phantoms and also the Wu soldiers once they begin to spawn. You can whittle down their HP with your own attacks, but make sure your bodyguard gets the actual kill. You can also press the Select button to make them switch to defense mode or have them stay and fight in one place. Make sure you go and pick up the health items in the pots when their HP starts getting low.

Note that in this stage, you yourself need to have at least 50 KOs to make the real Yu Ji spawn at the end, so just make sure your bodyguard is a good bit ahead of you. You can’t see how many KOs they have, but as long as the achievement icon is showing in the bottom right corner of your screen, you’ll get it once the stage ends.
