## 2) Introduction

[Pokémon Pinball](https://retroachievements.org/game/725) is a pinball game based on Pokémon for the Gameboy Color. As the title suggests, the gameplay is pinball-based, but with a uniquely Pokémon-inspired spin. For example, the game is divided into two tables, the Red Field and the Blue Field, each with different table designs, accessible map locations, and catchable wild Pokémon.

## 3) Walkthrough

This game is pretty straight forward. This section will contain some of the basics for playing the game. Topics reated to specific achievements will be in that achievement's section.
