## Intro

The month of November is a special month of the season that we tend to spend with family and friends. The Autumn leaves and cool air are just some of the joys that the season brings to us. This month I personally present one of my favorite dishes that we all can prepare for the holiday. As we are gamers and achievement hunters, it is only fitting that we are given a recipe from the popular video game: [Shaberu! DS Oryouri Navi (Nintendo DS)](https://retroachievements.org/game/14705)

**Shaberu! DS Oryouri Navi** is a recipe book all fit onto a DS cartridge with step by step instructions for cooking many traditional dishes. While the game is written in Japanese, a personal friend has provided us their very own translation of recipe #133.
