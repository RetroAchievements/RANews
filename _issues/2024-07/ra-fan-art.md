Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up and Challenge League Top 100 events.

**If you have made fan art for Bendyhuman's Challenge League Top 100 task and you want us to showcase your art, please send them to our inbox or let any of our members know, thank you! Any other fan art is also welcome!**

Link is at it again fighting three angry pink clouds, this time in our favourite place in Super Smash Bros. Melee: Final Destination! You know the rules: no items, 1v...1, and Link-only. I think I got the rules right?

We've also seen this topic in a previous edition: Pok√©mon versus Pocket Fighter! Wolfman has covered the GBA version of this totally-real game, with Ryu and Lucario ready to duke it out.

It's a party at the safari zone! Ash is already hunting the rare Chansey, but Brock has his sights on another beauty. Which of his iconic moves will he pull off this time?

Let's stick to the safari zone with the next art piece by StingX2! Brock has managed to behave themselves, as something even better than Nurse Joy appeared in front of him: the rare Tauros! How many safari balls will it take?

Bendy took the objective of "drawing angry pink Clouds" in a different way... now it's Link facing off against two angry pink Cloud Strifes! These iconic heroes have always been part of the question as to who is stronger, but now Link will have to prove his worth against double the trouble!

We got a really unique art piece here, complete with googly eyes! We have Kenny and Pikachu hanging out together on the bench playing the N64 video games with this epic art piece by r0ach3d!

Here we have Squirtle fighting Pidgeot in a battle. Unfortunately this art is very accurate to how the games work, because of course Hydro Pump with it's high-but-not-high-enough accuracy would miss! Better luck next time Squirtle.

Charizard, Venusaur, Blastoise, and Pikachu are also all ready for a battle... of intimidation! All standing in one corner, menacingly approaching each other in a battle to the death. Who will claim victory in this four-way battle?
