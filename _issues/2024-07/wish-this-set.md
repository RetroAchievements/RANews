## Tales of Innocence (Nintendo DS)

This is a Japanese exclusive title, but does have a fan translation by Absolute Zero. 33 players have requested this set. The game is an action RPG with lots of skits between events which flesh out the characters' personalities and backstories, plenty of skills to learn, typical of the [Tales of](https://retroachievements.org/game/9482) series. Each character specializes in a certain fighting style (swords, guns, etc.), offering variety in gameplay. You'll also learn about events in the past, as it's revealed that all of the cast are reincarnated. But evil forces are hunting them down. Achievements could include story progression, leveling up, obtaining certain items, and completing optional content like the guild missions.

## GO Series: Picdun (Nintendo DSi)

Picdun is an unusual cross between [Picross](https://retroachievements.org/game/4212) puzzles and a first-person dungeon crawler. In a time when DSiWare titles were small little games, Picdun stood out as a game with dozens of hours of gameplay for only 500 points. As you travel from room to room, fighting monsters and solving puzzles, the top screen will slowly fill out with the map - the solution to the puzzle - and in order to complete each floor, you need to reach every room in order to solve the puzzle. For anyone that likes RPGs and Picross, and wants something that is both yet neither at the same time, this Picture Dungeon might catch your eye!

## Kurohyou: Ryu ga Gotoku Shinshou (PlayStation Portable)

Are you a fan of [Yakuza](https://retroachievements.org/game/28546)? Well, did you know that two games exist for the PSP that we didn't get here in the West? Today let's talk about Kurohyou: Ryu ga Gotoku Shinsho and why it should get a set. Taking place during the events of Yakuza 4, this game stars a member of the Tojo clan trying to rob the Chinese when he accidentally kills a fellow Tojo clan member. He is then forced by the patriarch to fight for his freedom in Dragon Heat, a tournament over a number of days where he must beat 10 opponents for his own freedom.

The cutscenes are all done in manga style, but the game still has the open world exploration you have come to love in Yakuza. All the staples of Yakuza are here: tons of substories, gambling, Cabaret Club, bowling, and even part time jobs. In every aspect it is a bite sized Yakuza with a ton of meat on the bone to enjoy. The best part is a translation patch does exist for this game, so the hardest part is finding a dev partner to take us back to Japan, will it be you?

## Dragon Quest IV: Michibikareshi Monotachi (PlayStation)

Dragon Quest IV is quite different to its counterparts in the series - being divided into chapters can turn some players away from experiencing it out of fear of repeatedly having to grind characters over and over from level 1 or being stuck with a character they dislike. But those who've played any version of this game will agree on one thing: this is one of the best entries in the series.

The cast, the dungeons, and the story progression are perfectly executed, all the while striking a good balance in difficulty. Currently on the website, RA users can experience the [Dragon Warrior IV](https://retroachievements.org/game/4612) set, a game that has stood the test of time despite its limitations as an NES game, and the [Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen](https://retroachievements.org/game/9770) set, the DS remake of this game where you can attempt the extra dungeon or seek out to complete the "Big Book of Beasts". As such, one more forgotten version of this game remains without a set, the PlayStation 1 version that came out exclusively in Japan in 2001.

This version remains untranslated, which can be a big drawback to a lot of players, but it's possibly the best version of this game, boasting the PS1 charming visuals as well as quality-of-life improvements over the NES version and many new additions, without the ever-slightly uncomfortable experience of playing a dual-screen game outside of a DS. It'd be great to have a set of this game to give people the opportunity of reliving Dragon Quest IV once more.

I feel like we as a community have forgotten how weirdly adult Nintendo's marketing was for a time. It's difficult to imagine a company with a brand image as squeaky-clean as Nintendo's putting out [a magazine ad claiming their console was so distracting you'd leave a woman tied to the bed](https://www.timeextension.com/features/flashback-when-nintendo-was-forced-to-pull-its-offensive-game-boy-advert), but that was what we were contending with. Right at the tail end of the trend, the big marketing push for the Nintendo DS was "touching is good"; we can only be thankful there was only one touch screen on the thing, because merging that with "two is better than one" might have landed Nintendo in PR hot water so bad we never would have seen the Wii. One of the DS launch titles that coincided with this campaign was Sprung: A Game Where Everyone Scores. Subtle.

For its part, Sprung is a very bad game. The main story plays out similarly to a visual novel, where the player must navigate tough conversations with options such as "You have the most beautiful eyes" or "Wow, are those real?" You also collect items like jewelry and candy that you must use to steer the conversation toward a favorable outcome. Think [Phoenix Wright](https://retroachievements.org/game/1060), but for hooking up. Set developers will have to ensure not to include the two items that have inventory slots but are totally unobtainable within the game. So that's about the level of polish we're dealing with.

This game has largely been lost to time - for good reason - but you wouldn't believe that from its magazine ad print run. For a solid few months, multiple pages of Nintendo Power were dedicated solely to this game, along with titles like [Feel the Magic XY/XX](https://retroachievements.org/game/9524) (known more tastefully in Europe as "Project Rub"). It's fascinating to remember the DS as such a mature console and I think more people should know about this weird piece of history.

## I Spy Challenger! (Game Boy Advance)

I grew up being well familiar with the I Spy series of puzzle books. You wouldn't know it, given how bad I am at finding things nowadays, but that's beside the point. I didn't expect the GBA version of the game to be anything more than just a few more dioramas of random junk haphazardly scattered about. And yet I forgot how cathartic it can be to work through these, made just the more sweeter in this game where each item does a silly animation when discovered. It's simple, but it's also charming and joyful.

But that's just one part of the game. The developers took the concept of item finding and pattern recognition and spread it into three more game modes, each one distinct enough to be its own fulfilling experience. The least of these is essentially an object version of a word search, where you'll be given a sequence of objects and need to find it in a grid. Admittedly it's not particularly enjoyable, but the other two make up for it. These are puzzle games in stages where you'll need to sort out objects based on patterns that change each round. In one of them, the catch is that you're not told what the groups are. You'll see the groups divided into rings, and the screen will quickly autoscroll horizontally, looping from one end to the other, and you'll need to figure out based on what items are in what ring where to drop your current item. One group could be numbers, but that could be a child's counting block or a dice or domino. As early as the third round, these items aren't always immediately distinct. The last one is my favorite, in which you'll be given an example of the match you're supposed to make - for example, items that start with a given letter - but instead the game is an arcade-style puzzler where you fire it into a moving row of items as they're slowly pushed towards the edge of the screen. Match and both items are eliminated; miss and it remains and must be cleared again. Trying to spy what you need to hit while also lining up your shot adds just enough tension to keep this mode engaging.

All considered, the game is short, simple, and easy, yet I can't stress enough how this is an unironically enjoyable gameplay loop regardless. There's enough room for challenges to add to a potential achievement set, yet most players here won't have much difficulty with them regardless. And sometimes, having a simple set to knock out between tougher crusades is exactly what we want, and I Spy Challenger puts enough of its own spin that it stands out with other puzzle games and minigame collections of its kind. This is one I come back to every so often, and I'd hope to see others enjoy it as well.

## Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes II (PC Engine CD/TurboGrafx-CD)

Legend of Heroes is a very solid turn-based RPG series, and with the recent release of a set for the [first game](https://retroachievements.org/game/12889), it would be nice to see someone tackle the second, though there are definitely some hurdles that are actually doable to work around. One of the biggest is the lack of translation; however, GameFAQs does have a full game walkthrough. Even if whatever dev tackles this has limited Japanese skill, it would be pretty doable to make a set. There's a guide, the game mechanics are straightforward, and [Falcom](https://retroachievements.org/game/8454) games tend to have nice memory - the first game's memory was very easy to work with. The game has nice art and music and should be fun to play. It has everything that makes it very doable to make a nice set that players will enjoy.

This game deserves a set. On the surface, this looks like a cool, animated graphic novel and not much more. If you were to only go off this, the animation is still incredible, and it's a fun way to experience the incredible story of [Metal Gear Solid](https://retroachievements.org/game/11244). However, deeper down, you'll realize that it's more than just a digital recreation of the story. On nearly every panel, you can take a closer look at everything on the screen, allowing you to find hidden objects. There's around 250 for you to find throughout the pages of the novel! After you find each of these, your job is not over, however. You can take these objects and bring them into Memory Building Simulation, where you can combine them and create new objects. Overall, not only is this a fun recreation of Metal Gear Solid's story, but an interesting hidden object game that will require you to search every nook and cranny of the novel, and this deserves a set on the site.

These days, [LucasArts / Lucasfilm Games](https://retroachievements.org/game/11614) is known for [Star Wars](https://retroachievements.org/game/8358) titles and their graphical adventure games, but they do have a few exceptions that don't belong to either, and Gladius is a fantastic example.

Gladius, a turn-based RPG, is built around a series of massive gladiator tournaments. Sure, there's a fantasy RPG plot in there, somewhere, but even it's about the tournament in the end. We're not just doing simple skirmishes: the finals demands you qualify via sub-tournaments and special events that span the host nation, most of which demand some kind of gimmick or restricted roster that will have you scratching your head about which of your customized gladiators to take, or how to use them. Winning under weird and colourful restrictions is the name of the game. The tournaments politely keep going after the finals, so should you wait until you win and come back with new, unique units from other regions? Some tournaments aren't even open until later in the campaign!

Besides a few named characters, your entire roster is under your control at all times, so it's up to you to decide whether to be good at everything or to custom-build your squad for a blitz to the end of the finals. Should you hire a new barbarian, or a wolf? How do you upgrade them, knowing they'll never get everything there is to get? Do you get a duplicate fighter? What about the secret units hidden behind sidequests? Do you make sacrifices to KEEP the secret units? Fantasy and historical humans rub shoulders with minotaurs, yeti, and skeletons, each with their own options and limits. The sheer depth of content will have completionists working at this one for a WHILE.

In between battles, you'll fight bandits and follow the plot without any of the arena's restrictions, but also with the sudden threat of permadeath. Short, "timed hit" style attacks keep you awake between moves. You can even replay the game starting with the heroine or the hero, both from different starting nations, though they sync up in Chapter 3.

The GameCube version of Gladius is the one to play, featuring anti-aliasing and faster load times than the PS2 and Xbox (it also supports a 4-player co-op mode). The GC version even has some excellent fan texture packs that you can find online, although you'll probably have to do without while you work on any achievements!
