# Episode 22 - Mightier Than the Sword: Writing Team

Hello everyone, welcome back and thank you for tuning in with us for another episode of The RetroAchievements Podcast. Where we cover a variety of genres, topics, and discuss the bits and bytes of yesteryear!

They say putting 1000 monkeys in a room with a typewriter will create shakespear with enough time - but what if we could do better? What if we put a ton of people with hyper-focus abilities in a room dedicated to improving the experience of RA: Immediately you would have attention to detail, and an acumen for clarity and understanding - shortly thereafter structure would follow.

If the pen is truly mightier than the sword, a battle-ready army stands ready in the form of the Writing Team - and with every army needing a general, a leader steps forth with quality, acumen, and a disposition to strive for what's right.

For exactly that Reason, I have my guest here tonight, {% rauser Nepiki %}; to dive in on the writing team, and a little bit about themselves and what it means to contribute to RA
