In general the rings are easy to find as the level is just a square. Beware of fall damage, Cream can fly too high and then fall for damage. Use her flight as a cushion and never fly diagnolly.

Where the rings are
- Rooftops
- Between Buildings
- In the center alley
- On the sidewalks
- On the one billboard

{% raachpic 273012, 302414, Winter Park Carnival Ring Collecter %}

This level is set in a little amusement park and while small the rings really blend in color wise

Where the rings are
- Ferris wheel
- A line of rings on the rollercoaster entrance
- There are two on the rollercoaster
- One in the middle of the rollercoaster
- One in front of the dive tank
- Run around the merry go round and fountains
- Talk to the magician and stand back she explodes into a coin

{% raachpic 273019, 302421, Golf Corse Ring Collecter %}

The easiest level purely because there is more than 60 rings, but you have the real fear of death as all the golf platforms must be reached via wing cap.

Where the rings are
- Rings of rings in the air need wingcap
- First island has only a few
- Second island has a few enemies you need to carefully kill
- Hidden island behind waterfall, this has a bomb you need to kick and a giant enemy you must butt smash. It also has a coin block
- Third island has a bunch of rings and will be one of your bulk islands for gathering
- The island with the golf hole flag has a few rings but is mostly where you cash in
