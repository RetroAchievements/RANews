# Introduction

Welcome to the RAGuide for Kao the Kangaroo: Round 2 (PS2)!
The Hunter is back with a Vengeance! He brought an army with him and is planning to capture all of the animals! With the help of the Parrot and the other animals, Kao has to save everyone and defeat the Hunter once and for all!

Released in 2006, but first in 2003 for PC in Poland, Kao has gotten a very noticeable upgrade from the previous game. It is still a simple platformer with just a modest amount of collectibles to find, but comes with variety in the levels, from vehicles, to bosses and special levels. Kao has new moves to defeat the enemies, even using boomerangs to attack them from a far, and still stretches his neck to keep his head away from the water.

### Missables

Many achievements that are missable are about collecting anything under certain challenges. If you fail to do the challenge, you won't be able to retry it by re-entering the stage, as the collectable will not reappear if they've been collected. First of all, make sure to have a save that is before you collect anything in the level. Than, if you require to retry an achievement, abandon the game and reload the save.

### Clear the Levels, Collect Everything, Mini-games

Play through all the levels, and make sure to collect everything and get the upgrades! Many collectables will be out in the open, while others are either hidden inside vases, boxes, or barrels, or in the case of the stars, held by enemies that you have to defeat. Stars will also give you new moves or upgrades to some moves when you reach a certain amount.\
After four or three levels you will face a boss, each one with a unique way to deal with them. They are not really a challenge... unless you are doing the damageless challenges, even then it would be just a bit challenging.\
Mini-games will be unlocked when you reach a certain amount of crystals via doors that can be found in the hub world, the Dark Docks. These are not so bad, and are simple to play through.

### Challenges

Some of these are missable, so be sure to check the missables ones before anything. You can retry with anything that is not missable without a need to reload a save.\
Each level has one achievement assigned to them, including the boss levels. The boss levels have your standard damageless fights, while the level ones are varied and can be just as challenging.

## Tips

* Rolling is safer to use than just punching if you don't want to take damage from an enemy. It does require spacing.
* Kao's second jump slows his momentum. You can regain it by attacking in the air. It'll also give you a tiny bit of time in the air.
* Any boxes, chests, or enemy could hold a collectable, even houses (if you knock!).
* Wether you're strafing or not, Kao will properly target and hit an enemy if he's faced right in front of it, and near enough to land a hit.
* If you forgot a collectable and have yet to hit the next checkpoint, you can just lose a life to teleport yourself to the latest checkpoint, since you have unlimited lives.

`PROGRESSION`

The first level of the game will help you getting introduced to the platforming and combat with Kao! You'll also be introduced with the ability to throw nuts, how you can throw them far by building the bar all the way, and the very first "vehicle" section, the barrel; not too difficult, but can be in the first one with the strong river. The second barrel is not as difficult to collect the ducats, almost a straight line.\
You'll reach a windmill that is stopped. You'll need to save a beaver inside it to make it move the platforms outside again. The platforms will take you up to another caged beaver and to the next part of the level.\
At the end, you'll be riding a badger to try to get other tiny badgers to their homes. When you've done that, mushroom will appear from the ground that can lead you to the exit.

`MISSABLE`

[Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBSUAKOk18I)

The river in this section is strong enough to make movement hard to avoid the walls, especially with some ducats that are placed close to them. Approach the ducats carefully (try to move by tapping the buttons, rather than pressing them), and when collected immediately get away from the wall if too close. For some of them, little movements are better to align yourself better with the ducats.

**Warning**:  
Collecting the ducats will not make them re-appear when re-entering the level. Make a save before attempting the level.

Right away, you need to escape from a bear that can defeat you immediately if it reaches you. You need to grab the purple power-ups to escape it, while also avoiding holes and jumping on springs to get to parts of the path. This running section is divided in two parts, with a checkpoint in between, and different ducats that are scattered in each section that may require some trial and error to get them all. One part in the second section in particular is split in two directions, each having ducats to collect. You may need to fall on the water to get them all.\
After the running part, the game will introduce you to the boomerang, you'll ranged attack, albeit limited and requiring to be restocked sometimes. Not all levels have them, but they are mostly used to defeat enemies that can shoot from a distance in later levels.\
In between saving other beavers, throwing nuts to make platforms to cross rivers, and jumping on moving platforms in the cave, we'll find ourselves at the end, needing to lead a walking dynamate thing to a spring that is covered in ice. Lead it in between the stones and make it collide with the ice, then take the spring to the end of the level.

(6) Ducats: The first line of ducats is slightly to the right of the purple power-up.

`MISSABLE`

[Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V49pKztlJLo)

You don't actually need to collect all of them, as you'll end up with more than required with the optimal path, so you can miss a few of them, but not too much. The only ones you have to skip are the ones on the left spring in the split path. The right path leads to the most ducats, which we obviously have to take. The crystals in this level are located near the first checkpoint, you can't miss them.

**Warning**:  
If you couldn't get the required amount of ducats, you need to reload a save before entering the level, as the ducats won't be there anymore.

`PROGRESSION`

You'll be catapulted into a forest with trees so big you won't be able to see the bottom.\
Here you'll be introduced to the flying helmet. Repeatedly jumping while wearing it will have you gain altitude to make it possible to pass through some big gaps. It won't last for long so you have to move quickly.\
After going through the trees and taking a dangerous slide with bombs scattered all around, you'll meet a beaver that takes you to a safe place, where they'll co-ordinate an attack against the Shaman.

This stage will be about riding a boat in different locations to save the beavers that'll unlock the gates for you to proceed. The boat can move based on where Kao is positioned.

[Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZC2rrgjN3Y)

Always make sure to double jump, and use the hover ability if you have it, when jumping across the bridges to avoid the spikes that'll appear from the planks. The third set of planks is always safe to walk on.\
Some of the enemies you can just avoid and go through the level without fighting them, but with some you're better off fighting them. Among the enemies in the level, the ones that'll probably give you trouble are the carnivore plants and the hammer guys. The plants you just approach carefully to make them attack and then you jump attack them to hit them. Get away from them and repeat for a few times. The hammer guys, for some reason, even just touching their hammer can damage you. Make sure to dodge them when they attack, and combo them from behind. If you don't trust them, you can always roll into them to safely hit them. You'll need to use the roll attack at the last part, where there are two of them, to be always moving and dodging the attacks.\
The boat itself won't take damage if you hit a wall, but it does bounce you off, with the risk of leading you to a mine. Always stay in the middle and move only when needed. You don't need to move Kao to the end of the boat to move, even a little step can move the boat and gives you more control of it when trying to dodge the mines.

`PROGRESSION`

His lightning attack aims based on where you're moving, or if you're standing still at you. It does so at certain intervals that can be timed, although it's still annoying to dodge. If you don't hit the Shaman while the shield is down, the timing also gets much shorter.\
After a few lightning attacks, he'll start to make shockwaves. These can be dodge by jumping, naturally. While he's doing shockwaves, some tiles on the ground will lit up green. Ground Pound these tiles to make the panels reachable for your boomerangs. Hitting all the panels will take down the shield, making the Shaman vulnerable. After a few hits with the boomerangs the shield will be back. Repeat everything until he's defeated.

To dodge the lightning safely, run in circles. It's enough to mistarget the lightning.\
After a few attacks, the Shaman will get ready to make shockwaves. Watch for him lifting his staff, and get ready to jump. Then ground pound the tile with the green light and hit the crystals with your boomerangs. From here just hit him constatly to make him not able to attack. Do so until his shield is back, and repeat everything until defeated.

`PROGRESSION`

The first ice level will also give you the first introduction to the ice slide. It is as you'd expect, you'll be sliding all the way to the bottom, but you can also jump while sliding and even use the hover ability if you need to grab a collectable you missed. There will be also a tank you'll be using to break the ice and make platforms to move forward. The tanks will be guarded by balloons, and the moment you'll hop on it, the balloons will shoot bombs at you to destroy the tank. You can destroy the bombs while they are in the air, but it is better to also destroy the balloons.\
The hunter will show up in a submarine to cause a cave-in. You need to be fast, but also careful as you may accidentally jump into an opening on the ground. At the end of the cave is a ring made with stones. Jumping in the circle will make an opening, taking you out of the level.

<br>
(1) Ducat: At the start of the cave-in, instead of going right, if you go left and are fast enough, you should get to a barrel near a cage that has a ducat. You won't have enough time to get to this barrel if you go right, so you need to lose a life to get to this ducat.<br>
<br>
(1) Crystal: Before the corridor you need to get to to escape, there's one cage to the left, with a crystal on top.<br>
<br>
(1) Ducat: When you reach the first ducat of the corridor, the floor will collapse. You need to get to these ducats as fast as possible to not fall into the water.<br>

[Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2_KCMmxRI)

The two parts that require using the tank can be done without ever needing to shoot at the balloons. It is much harder on the second one if you don't destroy the icebergs in time, so consider destroying some projectiles or exiting the vehicle to avoid damage is also an option if you're not positive about making it in time.\
The only enemies that you have to bother defeating are basically anybody that shoots anything at you. Which means the spiders and the hunters. It's too risky to let them be around, especially in certain parts like the spiderwebs in the cave after the second tank. Speaking of which, when you see the hunter far away at the end of the cave, stick to the right, and try to dodge his projectiles moving to the left.\
The collapsing cave is probably the most annoying part of this level. You need to be fast, but not too fast to possibly die to an opening appearing all of the sudden in front of you. Don't double jump too much, just jump and then double jump or use you hover ability when the floor starts to break.

`PROGRESSION`

After falling through the opening, you'll slide into this cave. To go through this cave, you'll be riding a barrel and making giant icicles fall to make them into platforms with your tank. They will slowly sink into the water, so you should make sure to make them all fall in succession and then hurry up to the other side!\
The rest of the level will be sliding through some slides, and escaping another collapsing cave full of ice to the exit!

<br>
(13) Ducats, (1) Star: These are all in this section with the barrel. Of note are the last ducats and star that you can probably miss if you don't position yourself properly. Rather than being behind the line of ducats to the left, stay at the center, near enough that line to the left to still grab them. When you've collected them, immediately steer right to grab the star and the other ducats. You can always lose a life to get back to the beginning if not successful.<br>
<br>
(2) Ducats: At the end of the barrel section, there are two ducats to the direction of a closed gate. You'll be back to this gate later.<br>
<br>
(2) Ducats: In front of a group of icicles you need to jump over.<br>
<br>

<br>
(8) Ducats: In the area where you defeated the ice spike guys, to the right are two ducats in front of a group of icicles, and past that is a stack of six ducats lying there.<br>
<br>
(5) Ducats: The other path to the left has five ducats. You can either go back, or go forward and go left to that same path.<br>
<br>
(6) Ducats: Proceeding further, you should see a group of six ducats near a bell and boomerangs.<br>
<br>
(3) Crystals, (2) Stars: After the bell, there will be two hunters having one star each, and in between them are three crystals.<br>
<br>
(5) Stars: Moving forward just a bit after the hunters will make five ice spiky guys appear. Each of them giving you one star.<br>
<br>

<br>
(2) Ducats: Past the gate are two barrels near a cage, containing one ducat each.<br>
<br>
(9) Ducats, (3) Cystals, (2) Stars: Take the spring to be back to the area before the bell. Go back to the closed gate mentioned earlier, to the left of where you've landed. The gate will be open now. Go through it, jump on a ladder to find different collectibles all around a pond.<br>
<br>
(3) Ducats, (1) Crystal, (1) Star: At the beginning of the slide, in the first ramp.<br>
<br>
(4) Ducats, (1) Crystal: On the second ramp. Get yourself a bit to the left to have a good positioning for the jump.<br>

<br>
(4) Ducats, (1) Crystal: After taking the spring, there will be a third ramp with collectibles.<br>
<br>
(4) Ducats, (1) Crystal: A bit after the third ramp, another fourth ramp will be there after a turn.<br>
<br>
(3) Ducats, (2) Crystals: After the fourth ramp, near the wall to the right.<br>
<br>
(1) Ducats, (3) Crystals, (1) Star: Right after the line of collectibles is another one on the fifth ramp.<br>
<br>
(4) Ducats: At the end of the slide are two spli paths. Take the one with the spring to the right to get these ducats. This spring will also take you all the way back to the beginning of the slide if needed.<br>
<br>
(3) Crystals: At the end of the slide, take the path to the left instead. The three crystals are to the right of a beaver on a platform.<br>
<br>
(1) Star: One lone hunter will be guardian the passage, giving a star on defeat.<br>
<br>
(4) Ducats: At the end of the first slide, take the spring to also get these ducats.<br>
<br>
(4) Ducats: These are also on the second spring.<br>
<br>
(12) Ducats, (1) Star: Go further until you reach the bell in a section with ice. After the first ducat, take the right to be able to collect one star there. The rest are on the path.<br>
<br>
(3) Stars: Reaching the end, you'll find the last three enemies with the final three stars.<br>

`MISSABLE`

[Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0uhRoWgwOY)

First of all, hitting the walls also counts as damage, so avoid them while grabbing the ducats.\
To avoid the unavoidable projectiles from the spiders, you have to hit them before they can shoot their projectile at you. When they drop down from the ceiling, that's the moment to throw the boomerang at them.
There are two situations to watchout for: one part has two spiders appearing together. Taking damage here is unavoidable (unless you manage to hit both in time). The second spider is near the end, and it positions itself behind a wall that'll block your boomerangs. You need to be fast to not take another hit and to also collect the ducats. Stay at the center, near enough to the ducats to the left to collect them, and when you get the last one, move immediately to the right to collect the rest, then try to hit the spider. If it looks like you got hit, you actually didn't, because you were in invincibility from the first hit.

**Warning**:  
Taking damage more than twice will require you to reload a save prior to starting the level to make the ducats re-appear.

`PROGRESSION`

To make it quickly to the train with the animals, you'll be using a snowboard. It doesn't have the same control as with just going through a slide, but you do have the ability to slow down by pressing down, and you can jump on grind rails to ride them to either avoid obstacles or get to some collectables.\
Near the end, you'll be avoiding a snowplow that wants to stop you at all costs. Make sure to press down here to go faster and outrun the snowplow and its icicles. After you're successful in escaping it, you'll be on your way to the crystal mines.

(5) Ducats: To the right of the second line of hay, four ducats disposed in a line from right to left, to a breakable crystal with a ducat behind it. Remember, for the other breakable crystals, you should aim at the center of them to not miss the ducat.<br>
<br>
(8) Ducats: After the hays, one crystal to the right with a ducat behind, followed by a line of ducats.<br>
<br>
(6) Ducats: To the right, a line of six ducats, before a line of hays.<br>
<br>
(1) Ducats: Behind that line of hays is a crystal with a ducat.<br>
<br>
(9) Ducats: Jump above the icicles and land on the grind rail to get to a line of three ducats and another line of six ducats.<br>
<br>
(9) Ducats: Get to the next grind rail right in front of you. <br>
<br>
(14) Ducats: Four ducats will be before the next grind rail. Another ten will be on the grind rail.<br>
<br>
(10) Ducats: It's sort of tricky to get to this grind rail because of the icicle that'll appear in front of it. Try to jump at the last moment possible to jump over it. If you still get hit, align yourself to the grind rail to take it. Two ducats are in front of it, and seven are on the grind rail. A crystal will be at the end of it, slightly to the right. Without jumping, after you're off the grind rail move slightly to the right to get this ducat in the crystal.<br>
<br>
(1) Ducat: Before a jump, there's a crystal that requires you to move to the left to align yourself to the crystal, after dodging the icicle. Aligning yourself here will also make it better to get the ducats after the jump.<br>
<br>
(9) Ducats: After that jump is a line of four ducats leading to a grind rail, and five ducats on it.<br>
<br>
(5) Ducats: These ducats inside the crystals will be in a zig-zag section. Slow down here to be sure to get them.<br>
<br>
(7) Ducats: After the last crystal is a jump. To the other side is a crystal to the left, and a grind rail right after it. To be sure to grab the ducat in the crystal and the grind rail, try to jump when you're in the middle of the two hays. This way you'll land a bit away from the crystal, giving you time to get on the grind rail. Five ducats are on the grind rail, and at the end of it is another crystal, slightly to the left of it. Move left when you reach the end of the grind rail to grab this crystal.<br>
<br>
(60) Ducats: You'll be in front of a green grind rail. You don't need to move Kao left or right to collect the ducats in this, just to jump when Kao is in the red zone. All of these ducats will be in this section of green grind rails.<br>
<br>
(6) Ducats: Move to the right, under the rock arch. Under it are four ducats. At the end of it, sligltly left are two crystals with ducats one after the other.<br>
<br>
(11) Ducats: Right after the second crystal, you need to jump to the right where there's a crystal. Behind the crystal is a grind rail with ducats.<br>
<br>
(13) Ducats: After jumping from the grind rail, in the distance is a crystal, under another rock arch. Pass through the arch for another crystal right after the other one. Behind that second crystal is also another grind rail with ducats. At the end of the grind rail, drop from the grind rail to be able to hit two crystals close together under a rock arch.<br>
<br>
(1) Ducat: Either take the grind rail to jump off from, or simply jump to the right of the next rock arch to break a crystal with a ducat.<br>
<br>
(6) Ducats: Right after is a grind rail in the middle. For the next crystal that is right after the grind rail, it is suggested to jump early, as soon as you get all the ducats, to be distant enough from the crystal to be able to break it.<br>
<br>
(3) Ducats: After the jump, some crystals are dispersed here before the final grind grind rail.<br>
<br>
(11) Ducats: On the final grind grind rail, before the section where you escape from the snowplow.<br>
<br>
(53) Ducats: Try to keep yourself to the center of the path, as all the ducats will be placed in the middle. If you miss any, you can always slow down to let the snowplow catch up to you and try again from the beginning. The most problematic part are the three final crystals at the end. After you pass through the third road and catch the ducats after it, go a bit to the right from the middle to hit the first crystal, keep this position to be able to hit the second crystal, then to slightly to the left, back on the middle, to hit the third final one. Unfortunately, if you miss any of them, you have to restart the level.<br>

You CAN take damage, but it's ill advised as you'll lose control of Kao, and possibly leading you to a death.
When the Snowplow appears for the first time, try to use the grind rails to avoid the ice it'll create or move to the sides to not bump into them. Don't try to jump over them, as they're too high, although the very first one is possible to jump over.
The final part where you are running from the snowplow, keep pressing down this time to move faster and get a distance from the snowplow. At the beginning you need to move to the left to avoid an icicle that is aimed center. If you keep your speed and don't go off track too much, you'll outrun the snowplow and its icicles won't reach you. Keep at it until the end of the level.

The secret is that there are some parts that you can go through without jumping, with enough speed and moving off the slide in a certain point.\
The third jump you can just drop off easily. The penguins would normally require a jump, but you can just put yourself to the left and wait for them to charge at you and dodge them by moving to the right. After the penguins, for the next two jumps, the second jump can actually be done without jumping, but it is safer to just jump here.\
After the big jump, the next three jumps can be done without jumping. You need to move where there is snow on the slide to make it to the other side consistently. The jump that will cause the slide to break can be done without jumping as long as you try to land on the left side, so that you can avoid falling. The final jump you simply jump.\
When you've reached the end, there are two penguins here that can easily ruin your efforts if you don't move fast! You can't defeat them, so land to the right and move quickly before they reach you.

**Tip**:

There's another way to complete this challenge, requiring the usage of boomerangs. When you're about to fall from any of the jumps, throw your boomerang the moment you're starting to fall. You'll be still in the air when throwing the boomerang, allowing you to pass through the slides. Though it takes getting used to the timing.

`PROGRESSION`

You need to take down all the hunters of the train with boomerangs. Some can be hit if you're close enough to them or if they come out of their cover. Dodge their projectiles and throw at least two boomerangs to defeat them.\
After defeating everyone the Engineer will appear and you'll automatically take control of the tank. His only way to attack is to throw barrels at you, which can be destroyed by simply shooting them. When it's safe, shoot at him.\
When "defeated", you'll move to the next train with a new wave of hunters. You'll need to do this three times until you've actually defeated the Engineer.

[Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_CMblSD_Ho)

Moving in one direction is usually enough to dodge the projectiles. Moving a little back also helps a bit. After you've dodged a projectile, move to the opposite direction to dodge the next one. They're not that different from their level counterparts, except that they go down in just two hits. All three waves of hunters do start to the left and end to the right. Keep this in mind while moving.\
Boss can be taken down easily if you shoot really fast. Do give priority to his projectiles, though they are very easy to hit if, again, you shoot really fast.

`PROGRESSION`

You'll be put on a motorboat for a 3-lap race against some pirates for 1000 ducats.\
Power-ups will be around the track that will give you a full bar of boost to go faster. Boost is also useful to break the wooden obstructions and to make jumps that might lead to shortcuts.\
Winning the race will net you the promised 1000 ducats.

Get to all the shortcuts in the track and you'll achieve the required time. Jump on the rings of fire to make some shortcuts open for you to take (you might need the turbo to get to them). Of course make sure to not bump into any obstacle, and remember that while you're using turbo you can break through them.

**Tip**:

While you're using the turbo, you'll be able to break the wooden obstacles in the level without stopping. This can be useful to make some cuts or make some ramps easier to take.

After accepting to help the turtle, you'll be in your first (of the three) water levels. To save the turtles, you need to find the torpedoes and guide them to the cages to break them. When freed, they'll open the tunnels for you.\
Near the end of the level, you will face a big fish that shoots projectiles at you. It is sort of hard to avoid them, but you can defeat it before he does. After defeating it, you'll find a torpedo that brings to to the end of the level.

This level is sort of an auto-scroller now, because you'll be on the torpedo through a major part of it. Every time you launch the torpedo, another one will be sent to you for you to ride. You'll need to use them to defeat the enemies or break the gates that'll block the way. The level will also have a moltitude of obstacles, like gas that will damage you, and electric fences that can instantly destroy your torpedo.\
At the end of this level, is a cage with a turtle that you have to break. The turtle will open up the way to a sunken ship. Going through the sunken ship, you'll find the lair of the Octopus.

Despite being able to throw as many torpidoes as you want, they'll only defeat enemies if you're close enough to them. You're better off align yourself to where the enemy is coming from in your direction and then throw the torpedo at them. It is also a much safer approach.\
Try your best to not hit any electrical obstacle, as that will result in instant death. Smokes won't kill you, but will also deal so much damage that you're better off avoiding them as best as you can. Probably the only first three smokes are the hardest to dodge. The first gate can be very unfair to not bump into because of how slow it is to open itself. You can just take damage here and move one, or try to position yourself slighty higher than the ducats before the gate to align yourself where the opening you can pass through should be. The second gate is easier to pass through at least.

The Octopus basically tells you what you need to do for this fight...\
Shoot at the tentacles until all of them are retracted. Then guide the torpedo to the end of the tube, making sure it doesn't take too much damage or it doesn't get destoyed by the electricity. After the first attempt with the torpedo, he will sent out jellyfishes at you. Simply shoot them all, then you'll be back to shoot its tentacles. Three torpedo hits will defeat it.

Try to stay in the lower part and aim at the tentacles or the jellyfishes as best as you can. Your projectiles will follow the arena, meaning if they reach the curved part they will also curve, and can hit anything on the other side. You'll always get some heals whenever you reach the torpedo part, so some damage can be taken without any pressure.\
While technically you're not needed to keep L2 pressed while guiding the torpedo, you can also still keep it pressed, as it does nothing with the torpedo and you won't have to worry about not pressing L2 in time when taking control of Kao again.

This trip to the island will start with presenting to you a new "vehicle" section: you'll be riding the Pellican to reach far away platforms for flapping his wings a maximum of three times before he gives up and falls. It's sort of tricky to make him move like Kao, but won't take long to make it work.\
Across this section of the island, you'll reach a section with lava that will slowly fill the whole area, with your only option to go up through obstacles and with the help of the pellican. Reached the highest point, the pellican will take you to the next area, and the end of the level.

Excluding falling off into the lava and the obstacles, what you have to worry more about are the falling rocks, in the area after taking the first spring. There's one rock that you can avoid just by hugging the wall, but the next one you have to wait for it to fall before proceeding. There's also another one that'll fall on a wooden platform, but it's far enough that you should see it coming.\
Some terrain will also break when you pass through them, but you do have the possibility to jump out of there if you're fast enough to react.

Further ahead is a boulder that you have to make a path for to break the gate. You have to jump through the rings as fast as you can before it falls to do so.

In the area with the checkpoint, you have to worry about a hunter that will shoot you the moment you see him. You can either wait for him to reload, or hide behind cover, then jump and throw boomerang at them. Your safer waiting for them to reload, so that you can repeatedly throw boomerangs at them and defeat them faster (or even blocking them from moving if you are able to).\
Near the first hunter are two crabs that sometimes appear from the sand. Be careful about them if you're passing through there, and defeat them with an upgraded ground pound.\
For the last hunter, do the same as the first one, just don't get too close, or the balloon will shoot bombs at you. Once you've defeated the hunter, take care of the balloon. Get into a spot that is far enough for Kao to automatically aim at the balloon with the boomerangs. When it throws bombs, simply jump out of there, then reposition yourself. After destroying the balloon, go to the Pellican and you'll finish the stage.

The moment you see bubbles appearing, move there as fast as possible, even if it might be a mine that'll appear. Sometimes, however, some bubbles appear in points where it'll still take you some time to get to them. In these cases, you're better off skipping them and wait for other bubbles to appear. You're better off skipping them if you did not get to them immediately as they appear, rather than gamble if you will grab them or not.

**Warning**:  
As you need to grab exactly 20 chests, any button press that won't grab any chest will mean a failed challenge. You can grab the mines and lose a life to restart, as long as you did not grab all 20 chests.

`PROGRESSION`

The Pirate Captain will shoot bombs at you while also sending Pirates in your way, one at a time. These Pirates are more dangerous than the hammer guys, and just attacking them at front will just get you damaged immediately. They will also jump up in the air if you roll into them, but the upgraded roll can hit them just fine. Each one needs three hits to be defeated. When you've defeated three Pirates, the Pirate Captain will appear. Just like the pirates, he can hit you if you try to normally attack him, so you need to use any of the upgraded abilities with their extra range to hit him. After being hit once, he starts to spin around to try to hit you. You need to bring him to one of the cracks on the ground where you can see water coming out. When he's on top of these cracks, he will get stuck, open for one ground pound.\
After hitting the Pirate Captain once, in the next phase, instead of pirates, he'll send parrots, while still shooting bombs at you. These act in the same way as bees, so just wait for them to get stuck on the ground and hit them. After being defeated, the Pirate Captain appears again. Hit him and then get him stuck on another crack on the ground again and ground pound him. The next and final phase will be identical to the first one with the pirates. Dispatch the pirates, then finally defeat the Pirate Captain.

If you have gotten the upgraded roll ability by getting 200 stars, this will be very useful to hit the enemies while also avoiding the bombs. You can also use the upgraded ground pound ability, just make sure to use it after the bomb explodes to not be hit by the explosion.\
The Pirate Captain is safe to hit with the upgraded roll attack, and especially useful to get yourself in position in one of the cracks. Try to bring him in one of these cracks by following his movements.\
After you've hit him with a ground pound when he gets stuck, get out of there immediately! Or you'll fall into the water from the opening you'll create.

The usage of the infinite roll ability is essential to make it in time. It lets you move faster throughout the level and breaks boxes as you go. It will also break the rolling barrels half way through to go through that section easier. You should always use it whenever you can.\
For the pirates, it'll be much easier to take care of them with the upgraded ground pound ability. Use it constantly on them until they're defeated.\
Don't forget the hidden room at the beginning and the hidden box in the factory that requires flying to get to!

**Warning**:  
You won't be able to just restart the level if you failed to make it in time. Make a save before grabbing anything so that you can retry by reloading the save.

When he's ready to throw the bombs, it is best to keep yourself to the most south end of the stage to not accidentally be on top of one of the holes of the ship that'll appear.\
When you get to the platforms, try to not double jump as much (only if you can't reach one of the rock cubes or for emmergency), and prioritize getting to the next plaform.\
In the final phase, always move to one direction while strafing from a distance to dodge consistently his shots. If you keep throwing boomerangs fast enough at him and you manage to hit him, you can make him unable to move or even shoot (though always keep moving in case he frees himself).

You should get this during the Great Trees level.\
Keeping X pressed after making a double jump will make you hover with a flying helmet. Very useful to make certain jumps, and can also save you if you're about to fall. But after using the hover for a while, you will star to fall much faster, so you can't use it for longer periods.

| {% raachpic 332991, 375823, Ready to Explore the Alps of Sunsine Spring (5) %} | Obtain 100 stars to unlock the upgraded ground pound |

You should earn this during the Igloo Village level.\
The ground pound move will now make a shockwave that hits multiple enemies around you (or even destroy multiple barrels and boxes if it annoys you to punch them one at a time). This is a great move that lets you keep some distance from the enemies to defeat them more easily.

| {% raachpic 332992, 375824, A Kangaroo Ready to Join the King of Iron Fist Tournament (10) %} | Obtain 150 stars to unlock an improved tail attack |

You should earn this during Trip to Island (due to the underwater level lacking any stars to collect).\
Just like the ground pound upgrade, this will extend the range of the tail attack to make it easier to hit enemies in the air (you can in theory use it for the normal enemies by making a short jump to reach them, but it's very easy to get hit with this move, even upgraded). The upgrade will also make you stay in the air for a little more.

You should earn this during The Volcano.\
Not only this upgrade makes the roll move a good way to move faster in the levels, it also makes you almost invincible to enemies while using it, especially to pirates. This makes defeating enemies much easier, though you need to steer well to have a proper use of it.

| {% raachpic 332994, 375826, Accessing a Tasmanian's Endless Supply (25) %} | Obtain 250 stars to unlock unlimited boomerangs |

You should earn this during Hunter's Galleon.\
Infinite amount of boomerangs means you can actually use them whenever without worrying about their amount and against even other enemies besides those that can shoot you, though better aim is required for the other enemies. What's also of note is that you will always carry boomerangs, and can bring them even in sections that do not have them normally.

`MISSABLE`

Each level has a certain amount of collectables to find.

The Starting Ship will no longer be available after you leave the area. This means the ducats will be lost forever, requiring you to start a new game. Make Sure to collect all the ducats in the level before leaving.

| {% raachpic 333014, 375828, Roping Yourself Into Memorization (5) %} | Clear the Rope Mini-Game |

You can get to this mini-game by going through the door in the Dark Docks that requires 100 crystals. The door can be found to the right of bossman.\
Press any of the buttons that the Beaver will show to jump the rope enough times to win the mini-game. You can also recognize which buttons to press by the unique sound effect that they make when they show up.

| {% raachpic 333016, 375829, Rushing a Beaver's Business (5) %} | Clear the Trees Mini-Game |

You can get to this mini-game by going through the door in the Dark Docks that requires 100 crystals. The door can be found to the left of bossman.\
Press O and X as quickly as you can to make a bridge for Kao to pass through. You can use turbo for this if you are not able to do it quickly.

***

| {% raachpic 333018, 375830, The Closest You'll Get to the Boxart (5) %} | Reach a score of 50 in the Shooting Mini-Game (points after death don't count) |

You can get to this mini-game by going through the door in the Dark Docks that requires 150 crystals. The door is located behind the train station, near a big stack of boxes.\
This mini-game can go on until you get hit at least once, but for this achievement you need to reach 50 points. You earn one point by taking down one balloon. The balloons will appear in each wave in different numbers. They will also increase in speed the more waves you reach, making it more probable to reach high enough to shoot at you with a bomb. The bombs can be destroyed before they reach you.\
You can fire the turret very quikcly by tapping O fast enough. This will make destroying the balloons much faster with no real penalty.

***

| {% raachpic 333020, 375831, Birds of a Feather, Run Together (5) %} | Clear the Race Mini-Game with a time of 1:00:00 or faster |

You can get to this mini-game by going through the door in the Dark Docks that requires 200 crystals. The door can be found at the entrance of the pier where you meet the Pellican, to the left.\
Just like the Trees mini-game, press O and X very quickly to make the Pellican go faster. You can also consider using turbo here if you can't tap fast.

***

| {% raachpic 333022, 375832, Hey Ref, Can a Kangaroo Play Baseball? (5) %} | Clear the Baseball Mini-Game |

You can get to this mini-game by going through the door in the Dark Docks that requires 250 crystals. The door can be found at the entrance of the pier where you meet the Pellican, to the right.\
You alternate between offense and defense. In defense, you need to press O when the bar is almost full (you can't wait for it to get full or you'll get hit). When you've hit the ball, you need to press X and O at a certain rhythm to make Kao fast enough to reach all bases and score the most points. Unfortunately, because of the rhythm required, turbo won't be as effective here. When in offense, it is basically the same as defense, though you can throw the ball when the bar is full this time. No matter how fast you make the spike guy go, the hammer guy is fast enough to at least do three points. Make sure to not make too many faults and to take all four bases in defense to win.
