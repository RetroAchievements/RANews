RetroAchievements is proud to announce support for its 52nd console, the GameCube!

The Nintendo GameCube launched in Fall 2001 as a successor to the Nintendo 64. It features a handle so you can whack people with the Gamecube and yell "that's my purse, I don't know you!". The system used mini discs which actually spin backward as an attempt at anti piracy. This primarily worked until the end of the system's lifestyle. Unfortunately the mini disc format was hard to develop for by third-party developers. Although the GameCube was not the lowest powered system of the generation (that honor went to the PlayStation 2), it did often receive buggier versions of ports. Still, the system was not short on power or exclusives and boasts some of the most memorable exclusives in the generation.

With this launch, RetroAchievements is proud to announce this was our **Biggest Launch** of all time with over 100 games here at release. That means GameCube will launch with over 25% of the system's library already available!

This project was spearheaded by [LillyJade](https://retroachievements.org/user/LillyJade) at the coding helm, and the entire project at this point was a good 2 years of work. We also have to thank our partners at the Dolphin Team for working with us to get this product out the door.

We also need to thank the Writing Team led by [Nepiki](https://retroachievements.org/user/Nepiki) who have made sure these sets are up to a high standard for English readability. We also can't forget to thank the Dolphin Testers for taking the sets and beating them with a hammer to find lingering bugs and errors. Finally, thanks go out to the Rollout Team who have helped over the past two years including [Snow](https://retroachievements.org/user/Snow), [StingX2](https://retroachievements.org/user/StingX2), [TheMysticalOne](https://retroachievements.org/user/TheMysticalOne), [AuburnRDM](https://retroachievements.org/user/AuburnRDM), [pinguupinguu](https://retroachievements.org/user/pinguupinguu), [televandalist](https://retroachievements.org/user/televandalist), and [Sutarion](https://retroachievements.org/user/Sutarion).

Furthermore, an event for the GameCube launch is now ongoing as well. Check out [this forum post](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=27246) for all the details regarding this event!

**With RANews, we wanted to take a look at each of the games released during this rollout and give you a short introduction on what to expect. This will be split up into two articles, with each covering a random set of 50 games! Here is the first set for you to check out:**

| {% ragamepic 25456, 088925, Naruto: Clash of Ninja %} | 3D Fighting |

By: {% rauserpic Layton %}

Based on the manga and anime series by the same name, Naruto: Clash of Ninja is a 3D Fighting game where you pit popular characters against each other, such as the main protagonist Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura and Sasuke, and many more, each with their own specialties. The player can choose to do so in a variety of modes, ranging from your usual One Player and Two Player modes, to Survival and Time Attack mode and of course the Story which follows the "Land of Waves" arc from the first part of the series where you play exclusively as Naruto. Playing each of these modes will unlock new features over time, such as new characters and stages. The set will also focus on clearing modes as each character and unlocking new features, so strap on your headband as it's Ninjutsu time!

You'll find some fun and unique boss challenges, exciting side quests, plenty of collectables and other miscellaneous secrets.

The second subset is a Multi set! You'll be able to partner up with a friend (or 3!) and tackle the dungeons within the game. It's always better to journey with company.

[Message received... Sender: Creator... Subject: Hints of a Heroic Invasion]
Attention all units, I have received rumors that those troublesome animals are at it again in hopes of foiling my plans. They must think of my brilliance as that of a fool! Even if they can obtain all the emblems and A ranks, I have some new tricks up my sleeves. A new set of challenges to delay their advances. They will need to scour those fourteen levels to find the many secret items and alternate routes. Not only that, there’s a new set of challenges for those levels ranging from score attacks, solo characters, sneaking without that troublesome chameleon, along with many more for my fights against them or against each other.

There’s some talk about that cat’s party finding different goal rings, but that’s complete nonsense if you ask me. And I’ve received some reports of those pests going into the Bonus Challenge Special Stages, what could they be doing there even when the Chaos Emeralds are not around?

This fight won’t be the same as what came before, let’s see if their skills can even come close to trivializing this new plan of mine!

1 Day Since Impact

My ship, the S.S. Dolphin, was struck by a meteor, and I was forced to make an emergency landing on this strange alien planet. I thought all hope was lost, but luckily I encountered these strange living plant-like creatures. I’ve decided to call them “Pikmin”. They seem responsive to my whistle, and I can throw them to attack enemies and interact with the environment. In larger numbers, they can tackle tasks even I would think were unfathomable, like returning my missing ship parts!

Unfortunately, this planet’s environment contains high levels of poisonous oxygen, and my life-support systems can only function for 30 days. I must recover my 30 ship parts and escape within 30 days. Failure is not an option!

Not only is it the best selling game on Gamecube, for some, it is THE reason to have a Gamecube. Even after three sequels, many players find themselves coming back to it. In fact, you might be playing it as we speak. There’s few games with the reputation and legacy of Super Smash Bros. Melee. Taking Smash 64 and turning it into a massive experience and party game powerhouse, offering an epic Adventure Mode, the start of Home Run Contest, the return of Break the Targets, and the premiere multiplayer experience on Gamecube, Super Smash Bros. Melee has not only outlived its home system, but even later games in its own series. I’d write something else here to sell you on Melee but let’s be honest: I don’t have to. You’ve booted up the game by now.

By: {% rauserpic shnick1980 %}

The 1998 Survival Horror classic Resident Evil 2 made its way to the GameCube in 2003. While somewhat disappointing that it was only a straight port, and not a full remake like what its prequel received, there is still much to appreciate about the GameCube release. It contains all of the content from the PlayStation DualShock release, playable at a higher resolution with better quality sound and FMVs. It’s also the only port besides the Nintendo 64 to fit both Leon and Claire’s scenarios onto a single disc, allowing you to more easily switch between scenarios as you wish. Another major quality of life change is the ability to skip nearly all in-game cutscenes, not just the FMVs like the other releases, which perhaps could make this port a speedrunner's dream. It might lack some of the exclusive content of the N64 and Dreamcast ports, but the GameCube version is still a very nice version of Resident Evil 2 to play.

Swings your arms from side to side, come on it's time to go, do the Mario! Take one step, and then again. Let's do the Mario, all together now!

The popular Dance Dance Revolution series returns, this time with music of our favourite plumber! With Waluigi attempting to steal the four wish-granting Music Keys but failing, the keys scatter across the kingdom. Now it's up to either Mario or Luigi to dance through the kingdom to recover them, dancing along a wide variety of remixes from Mario and Donkey Kong games, as well as popular songs such as the Turkish March from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka from Johan Strauss II. If the story mode wasn't enough for you, there are also some minigames to check out for high scores, utilizing classic DDR controls. Save the Mushroom Kingdom again with the power of dancing!

By: {% rauserpic tomojin %}

Radirgy was initially released in the arcades, and is one of the most distinct-looking bullet-hell shoot 'em ups from the time with its cel-shaded graphical artstyle. It ended up being ported to Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and of course the GameCube, with it being very close to getting localized. Sadly it did not leave the country of the rising sun, but fortunately that won't be an issue for us as it's perfectly playable without any knowledge of the language needed! There are a total of five stages to take on in either Arcade or Manpuku mode, with three different ships that all come with different speed settings and weapons. Dodge the bullets and chain combos to rescue your father and the medicine to your radio waves allergy from terrorists!
