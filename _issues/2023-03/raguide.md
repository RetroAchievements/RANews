# 2) Introduction

Pokémon Yellow is the fourth version of Generation 1, and the third version for us in the west. This version is an enhancement over Pokémon Red and Blue, having some quality-of-life features but mostly attempting to draw in more people due to the popularity of the anime at the time. While the story is still the exact same as the original game, some anime characters like Officer Jenny and Jessie and James are more prevalent, and the starter Pokémon is Pikachu. This Pikachu is special as it can evolve, and will always follow the trainer and can be interacted with.

The achievement set consists of a total of 77 achievements, created by users Blazekickn, [stfN1337](https://retroachievements.org/user/stfN1337), and [dude1286](https://retroachievements.org/user/dude1286). This set covers everything there is to do in the main story, as well as some additional challenges that mostly revolve around you using your own pikachu, and a bunch of friendship achievements to see if Pikachu is happy with you or not. Be sure to shower him with love, as he will be your best friend during this game--whether you want to or not.

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story-related achievements**](#step-1-story-related-achievements--total-points-193)

All of these achievements happen during the story, which means from the start to beating the Pokémon league. For your playthrough, I highly recommend going to the options right away and setting the battle style to "set", and doing a Pikachu-only run. There are some achievements where you may only use Pikachu, and it also makes the grind to level 100 easier as you'll be around level 80-90 when arriving at the league. You also need to beat the entire Pokémon League with just Pikachu so whether you like it or not, your Pikachu will have to be close to max level anyway. This Pikachu-only playthrough is not as hard as it sounds, especially not with items such as X-Defend and X-Attack. Recommended moves to teach Pikachu are Double Team, Thunderbolt, and Body Slam (TM found in the S.S. Anne).

The following achievements for this step are missable (in chronological order):

* [Smell You Later! [m]](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81656) - Before Gym 1, west of Viridian City.
* [Prepare for Trouble! [m]](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81657) - Before Gym 2, Mt. Moon.
* [Make it Double! [m]](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81668) - After Gym 3, Game Corner in Celadon City.
* [Unite All Peoples Within Our Nation [m]](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81670) - After the Game Corner, Pokémon Tower.
* [The Sleeper Awakens](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/4446) - Involves catching Snorlax, for which you only have two chances.
* [Denounce the Evils of Truth and Love [m]](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81673) - After the Pokémon Tower, Saffron City.

***

[**Step 2: Pokédex Completion and Trades**](#step-2-pok%C3%A9dex-completion-and-trades--total-points-129)

There are a total of 129 Pokémon to obtain in Pokémon Yellow, not including trades. You only need one Eeveelution, either fossils from Mt. Moon, and either Hitmonlee or Hitmonchan for example. There are no real missable Pokémon aside from one-chance encounters, such as all legendaries and Snorlax. Keep in mind that there are also only 5 Moon Stones in the game, and there are four Pokémon that need them: Nidorino, Nidorina, Jigglypuff, and Clefairy. Wigglytuff is also able to be bought from the Game Corner in case you have no Moon Stones left. Before you start this step, I also recommend getting 50 Pokémon as quickly as possible and then talk to Professor Oak's aide near Fuchsia City for an Exp. All.

Missable achievements:

* [Uno, Dos, Tres](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/4447) - Capture Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres.
* [Creation Gone Wrong](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/4448) - Capture Mewtwo.
* [Gotta Catch 'em All - Yellow](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/4450) - Catch all Pokémon.

[**Step 3: Miscellaneous achievements**](#step-3-miscellaneous-achievements--total-points-116)

A few achievements that don't fit in any other category, and can generally be done at any time. The sole exception to this rule is the missable achievement of this step. Do **NOT** beat any trainers on Routes 12-15 before having obtained the PokéFlute. To attempt this achievement, you need a Pokémon with the HM Cut and if you're doing a Pikachu-only run, it is recommended to take ethers/elixers to restore PP without leaving the area.

Missable achievement:

* [The Long Way Gauntlet](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81681) - Beat all trainers on Routes 12-15 without leaving the area.

***

[**Step 4: Pikachu Mood Achievments**](#step-4-pikachu-mood-achievements--total-points-30)

All of these achievements involve talking to Pikachu when its mood is right. General tips are given during this step, but I recommend talking to Pikachu often so you have to put in less effort near the end.

Missable achievements:

* [Signature Move [m]](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81816) - Teach Thunder/Thunderbolt to Pikachu, then talk.
* [Surprised Pikachu Face [m]](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81976) - Talk to Pikachu during the Bill transformating event.
* [Clefairy Used Attract [m]](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/81977) - Talk to Pikachu after talking to Clefairy in the Pokémon Fan Club.

_Catch all 129 obtainable Pokemon on a single save file._

-=MISSABLE=-

This requires you to get every single obtainable Pokémon in the game. Don't kill any legendaries and Snorlax, and be careful with Moon Stone usage, and you should be more than fine. A few tips and tricks:

1. As mentioned during the walkthrough, get 50 Pokémons to obtain the Exp. All from the Professor's Aide near Fuchsia City. This item will spread experience over all Pokémon in the party. If you went with a Pikachu-only playthrough, I recommend just battling the Pokémon League over and over again with your Pikachu and the Pokémon that need to be leveled, as you can just spam Thunderbolts- and Body Slams when near max level to beat the league and if you lose, it shouldn't be a problem as you only lose a bit of money. You could also level all Pokémon individually but that will take far longer. Making Dratini part of your grinding team right from the get-go is recommended due to it needing to be level 55 to fully evolve.
2. Spend all money winnings from the league on buying coins from the Game Corner. It's faster than actually doing the slots. If you still prefer to do the slots, there is a cheese strategy by always focusing on the system in the bottom right.
3. Focus on the Safari Zone first, and capture every Pokémon there that you don't have yet. Specific Pokémon in the Safari Zone (Pinsir, Scyther, Kangaskhan etc.) are going to be a massive pain to catch, so you might as well try and get every other Pokémon while you are farming there.
4. Consider catching evolutions instead of leveling them up to evolution to save time. Many Pokémon evolve in the level 30-40 range, so catching them is a good alternative.

Level up your Pokémon in Slot 1 from 99 to 100. If you did a Pikachu-only run, your Pikachu should be around level 80-90 when reaching the league, so just keep fighting the league over and over again for those final levels.

_Defeat all Trainers from Routes 12-15 without leaving the "Route 12-15" area. (One Session)_

As mentioned during the walkthrough, do not go to these routes until you have both the PokéFlute and a Pokémon in your team with Cut. You don't have to go on water. Potions and Ethers/Elixers are highly recommended.

* Route 12 has 4 trainers (all Fishermen).
* Route 13 has 11 trainers (2 Bird Keepers, 1 Rocker, 5 Jr. Trainers, 2 Beauties, 1 Fisherman).
* Route 14 has 7 trainers (3 Bird Keepers, 4 Bikers).
* Route 15 has 11 trainers (4 Jr. Trainers, 3 Bird Keepers, 2 Beauties, 2 Bikers). Note that one of the trainers is behind the cut tree.

_Beat the Elite Four and the Champion of the Pokemon League with only Pikachu in your party. (One Session, No Surfing Pikachu)_

I've been warning you this entire guide to focus only on Pikachu so if you didn't, have fun grinding your Pikachu close to max level for this achievement, because you are going to need it. As mentioned during the intro, I recommend having the moves Thunderbolt, Body Slam (TM aboard S.S. Anne), and Double Team. The fourth move is your choice, but Thundershock always works due to its high PP. Bring a lot of X Attacks, X Defends and X Specials if an elite four ends up being too tough, and Ethers/Elixers to restore PP.

1. Lorelei is pretty easy, just keep spamming Thunderbolt to win.
2. For Bruno, use 6 double teams and some X-items. The first Onix isn't too dangerous, but the second one is if you don't use this preparation. Use Body Slams on the Onixes, and Thunderbolts on the other Pokémon.
3. Agatha is also easy, just keep spamming Thunderbolt to win.
4. Kill Lance's Gyarados first, then use the double team/X-Items strategy if needed on the Dragonair that comes afterwards. Gyarados' Hyper Beam is surprisingly dangerous and has a high crit chance, so don't risk it.
5. Your only true worry here is the Sandslash. You won't have the luxury to use the double team/X-Items strategy due to an Earthquake that loves to crit, so use Body Slam twice to kill it A.S.A.P. You can use the strategy on Alakazam, but the remainder of the Pokémon shouldn't be too tough to deal with.

Like I mentioned during the walkthrough, it is recommended to check up on Pikachu often, like after every win or loss. Once you're aiming for the achievements you're missing, keep the following in mind:

* The easiest way to increase friendship is to give Pikachu potions (even at full health). The easiest way to decrease friendship is to store Pikachu in a PC box over and over.
* Friendships are sorted by groups with 3 moods each: 0-50, 51-100, 101-130, 131-160, 161-200, 201-255. Once you get a reaction that is within one of these groups, you can work on changing Pikachu's mood to get the others within that group.
* The easiest way to change Pikachu's mood is by losing/winning a battle or doing the before-mentioned friendship methods.
