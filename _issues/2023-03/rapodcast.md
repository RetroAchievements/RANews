# Episode 7 - Art Team: Apply Your Warpaint!

When scouring the catalogue of options and offerings to enjoy, one of the first things many players notice after selecting their game is the associated art, icons, and the ever-elusive Mastery Badge. A constantly changing and evolving landscape within RetroAchivements, where any user is able to raise their paintbrush should they believe in themselves, and their skills - to make a lasting mark on a game they love.

This week we sit down once again with {% rauserpic gollawiz %} as we dive in on the Art Team. The war-horn bellows and the stage is set for battle, have you prepared for the (icon) gauntlet before you?!
