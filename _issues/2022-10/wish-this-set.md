## Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike (Dreamcast)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Console   | Genre    |

Surprised this legendary fighter doesn't already have a set for its most popular console port! What can be said about 3rd Strike that hasn't already been said before? In the FGC, it is one of the most praised fighting games of all time. Every character is incredibly fun to play, pulling off a well-timed parry makes you feel like a god, and every punch feels heavy and real. The arcade version of this classic already has a great set, but the Dreamcast version of the game adds new features such as a training mode and an unlockable version of Gill, the game's ultimate enemy. A set for this game could include combo trials in the training mode, and of course unlocking Gill himself. Also, does anyone else think it would be cool to have an achievement to use Twelve's copy super on Gill and beat him with it?

I don't think it's out of line to say that Platinum is the definitive version of Gen IV. The dex is better, the improvements that started merely with the physical/special split, just more fleshing out of the Sinnoh region, etc. But how exactly can one judge if something is better without first playing the previous game?

Diamond and Pearl were something of a re-joining of the franchise for myself. I enjoyed Gen's 1 and 2, but the music and sound effects of the GBA Pokemon games were a huge turnoff. Pearl was what got me back into Pokemon and solidified a lifelong addiction.

It is also a history lesson. It's not that the games are bad, just that history has judged Platinum to be the best version of Sinnoh. Without D/P though, we wouldn't have a Platinum to enjoy in the first place. It deserves to have a set, and for the community to judge for itself exactly what makes Gen IV so special to many Poke-maniacs.

Or should I call it Shadow the Edgehog? Either way, it's a fun game, very often looked down upon and extremely underrated in my opinion. I guess the biggest gripe with it are the 326 routes which honestly I don't mind that much. (On that note, subset of that please)

It's got a lot of guns too, as well as motorcycles to drive. Because when you're playing as an edgy hedgehog that is basically a furry version of Vegeta, of course you gotta do something crazy. Now, someone make that set and find that damn FOURTH Chaos Emerald!

Imagine, if you will, a game like GTA but set in London with a focus on realism. You have no HUD. The only way to the objective from point A to point B is the blinkers on the back of your car. The combat can be unforgiving if not handled right. The story is inspired by British gangster films, most notably Get Carter and Snatch. You take control of a man who recently got out of jail and is now blackmailed to do a variety of jobs to get his son back from his old crime family.

How do you kill something that has no life, yet walks and points a gun at you? What do you do, knowing that not even death is an escape, but rather a one-way ticket to becoming the same kind of maddened corpse?

Siren (or Forbidden Siren in the PAL region) is a 2003 horror game for the PS2 directed by Keiichiro Toyama, who also directed a small cult classic known as [Silent Hill](https://retroachievements.org/game/11252). It tells the tale of a variety of characters in a small Japanese village, as they attempt to survive a supernatural disaster turning villagers into walking corpses known as Shibito. Shibito cannot die no matter how you fight them, only be stunned, and some are capable of using weapons including guns, while others undergo horrifying mutations. As such, in most cases you're encouraged not to fight them, using stealth instead. What helps you in this is a unique ability called sightjacking, which allows you to utilize the sight of enemies around you, tuning into them like a radio to solve puzzles and assess the area.

Anyone who's a fan of this game will likely be able to pinpoint just how incredibly terrifying the atmosphere is; the environment combined with the game's sound design do a fantastic job at making you feel uneasy, and this is further amplified by how the characters look. The facial animation method used make the faces far too realistic for the time, completely nailing an uncanny valley feel which increases how spooky the game is. One tip I can give for the game is that, if you get stuck (which can be easy), do not be afraid to look into a guide. While the game's manual offers hints, part of the game's concept was for people on the internet to solve the game together, kind of like PT.

In terms of possible achievements, the game has an innate stage select allowing for comfortably adding sub-challenges (ex. time attack), and has many story-related collectibles to grab, letting you hunt achievements and get invested in the story at the same time.

## True Crime - Streets of L.A. (PlayStation 2)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Console       | Genre            |

There was a time when everyone wanted to be GTA. True Crime was one of them, but this one came with a twist: it was GTA mixed up with Max Payne and kung fu.

I don't know if it's nostalgia, but this game was badass. Car chases, bullet-time in action with intense gun fights, explosions, kung fu, and a pretty nice soundtrack. This game is also very short; I remember being able to reach the credits after a few hours. There are collectibles hidden in the city too. There are already a lot of PS2 games available, and with so much to play, this game being short is actually a good reason to get this set right in the hype of the PS2.

I think this game (like the others in the series) deserves a set because of its approach to horror. You, just a human being, walk around the abandoned mansion somewhere in Japan trying to find your brother. But the mansion is haunted, and the ghosts don't want to let you complete your goal and just leave. So you are trapped in there and your only weapon is a paranormal camera which can deal damage to the ghosts.

As for objective reasons, they are: unusual weapon (a camera with four types of film), unusual setting (an abandoned Japanese mansion), a ritual which existed in real life, and a function to save photos made in game to a memory card.

It's quite an understatement to say that Shenmue was one of the most influential video games of its time. Everything that we know about modern sandbox games, be it Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto or Sega's Yakuza, are heavily inspired by Shenmue.

Shenmue tells the story of Ryo Hazuki, who in late November 1986 came home from school to see his father being murdered by Lan Di, a high ranking member of the Chinese Black Market organization Chi You Men. Ryo swears to hunt Lan Di down and avenge his fathers death.

You spend most of the game walking around the city of Yokosuka, where you hunt down for clues of Lan Di and his henchmen whereabouts. But you can also do several side activities, like getting capsule toys, taking care of a homeless kitty, and playing old Sega arcade games like Hang-On and Space Harrier.

While it was a big financial bomb for Sega (the marketing cost was around 60-70 million dollars), the influence remains undeniable. Shenmue remains a one of a kind experience.

The Warriors, available for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, is the best adaptation of a movie to the video game media. Not only captures the essence of the original film when telling the story, watching the scenarios, listening to the licensed soundtrack, and the original music, but it didn't stop at just telling the story of the movie with a slight interactive touch. Value is added by unlocking side missions that show events prior to those in the movie, as we complete the main story. This adds a lot of value, and complements the plot of the original work really well. It has comfortable gameplay, has aged well, and has one of the most fun multiplayer campaigns I've come across on the consoles it was released on. It was the best thing to get together with friends, and family, to complete the entire game in multiplayer, or have quick matches in the extra modes.

Despite its good reception, it hasn't been one of the most popular games developed by Rockstar Games, but it would be great to have a set of achievements established for it. Something to encourage players to complete it 100%. Based on finishing side missions, completing the story on the highest difficulty, trying the extra modes, and completing all levels in their entirety. This is a truly unique game, whose addition to RetroAchievements with full support could help more people get to know it. :)

Onimusha 3 is a massive success among the fans, and even for people that didn't play the series as a whole, they know about Oni 3. Oni Dawn of Dreams is an absolute must play, expanding the controls of previous Onimusha games by giving you additional moves, special moves with button inputs, and even different magic gimmicks. The game can easily provide you more than 50 hours of gameplay, and maybe the triple of that if you want to challenge Hard mode, and even Oni mode, where every damage you take drains your HP to 1. The weapon arsenal is MASSIVE, having 5 playable characters, each having many weapons with different attributes and elements. This game even has a Co-op mode if you have a friend to play with.

Be sure to check out the epic conclusion of this quadrilogy. You won't regret it, I guarantee.
