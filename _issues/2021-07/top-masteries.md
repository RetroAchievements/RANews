## Intro

We often look to the leaderboard to see who has the most points, and those gamers work very hard to be the best. Some live, eat, and breathe fire for achievements and their quest for MORE POINTS. I wanted to take a look at a different approach to the best gamers on this site. Some of our best gamers are mastery chasers, and some even stay on one particular system.

So, here's the current list of Top Mastery and your champions, give it up to these users they worked their butts off to prove that points are one side of this story, Masteries are the other side.

Special thanks to {% rauser Nydaxn %} for creating the nice-looking images for the rankings
