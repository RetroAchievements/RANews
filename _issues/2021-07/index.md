## How to Contribute with RANews

If you have an idea for an article to be published in the RANews, please go to the {% rauser RAdmin %} profile page and send us a message.

Keep in mind that the article must be written in markdown format. If you don’t know it, you can learn it in 10 minutes following this online tutorial here: <https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/> (it’s pretty similar to what you may be already using on discord).


## Quick Overview

What to expect from this issue.


### Editorial

A message about how monetization works in the RetroAchievements scene.


### DevNews

What's going on in the Achievement Creation scene.


### Play This Set

Community members talking about their favorite sets and why you should play them. Cool stuff!


### Retro Throwback

It's where players can show their passion for the games they actually played in the old days. We can think about it as "a longer play-this-set article" but with a bigger load of nostalgia.

This month {% rauser Bendyhuman %} shows his passion about the Game Boy Color.


### RAGuide

{% rauser ENZYME1 %} presents us a guide about Blaster Master (NES).


### Current Events

List of running events in the RetroAchievements scene that are still open to join.


### HotCheevs Monthly

List of achievement sets released in the last month.


### Revisions and Rescores

Which sets got a revision or a rescore.


### Most Wanted Games

List of games with no achievement sets that community is excited to see. Hopefully it can encourage some achievement creators to pick a game and create a set for it.


### Top Masteries

Who are the champions of each console? {% rauser StingX2 %} brings another view of the great players we have in this community.


### Top Players

Some statistics about the top 300 players of RetroAchievements and how they progressed over the last month.


### Art Updates

Which sets got their game icons and/or badges changed.


### Fun
