## Spot the Difference

Since a few weeks a new trend appeared in the Johto-Region. More and more people are searching for Pokémon which have an unusual color than normally. However, it seems like different colored Pokémon are not the only weird things here. There are 10 differences in Goldenrod City too. Can you find all of them?

Note: The first user who finds the 10 differences and sends proof to SporyTike via Site DM or Discord will be listed in the next issue as the winner and can decide the game of the next picture.
