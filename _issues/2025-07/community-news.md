## RetroAchievements on Bluesky

RetroAchievements is now available on Bluesky, with over 1,000 followers! If you are using this platform as well, please consider giving us a follow at [https://bsky.app/profile/retroachievements.org](https://bsky.app/profile/retroachievements.org).

## Hash Compatibility Testing

The QA-team is happy to announce a new process for hash compatibility testing! This allows users to help test hash compatibility for existing sets. You can work with the developer on testing new hashes while mastering the set to verify compatibility.

More information can be found in the docs at [Player Compatibility Testing](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/player-compatibility-testing.html).

## PlayTester Revamp

The PlayTester team has been revamped in order to expand the team and its current capabilities. Playtest requests can be submitted and discussed via Discord in the new forum channel.

Reach out to {% rauserpic TimeCrush %} for more information.

## Cheat Investigation

We've started an official cheat team and created the dedicated account {% rauserpic RACheats %}.

If you suspect anyone may be cheating or see suspicious scores/times, you can send a DM to that account and the team will look into it.

## Official RA YouTube

## Site Updates
### RAWeb 2025.06.12
**Highlights for Players**
- Search 2.0 is now live in the site navbar. All kinds of creative searches are possible now that weren't before, for example: "gta vice city", "pokemon black 2", "donkey kong arcade", "ff7". Give it a try!
- RetroPoints (white points) on user accounts will now slowly recalculate over time rather than being stuck after someone finishes playing a game.
- User Profiles will now show real playtimes (in addition to calendar playtimes) for beats/masteries if we're reasonably sure we've captured your correct playtime on the server.
- On event pages, you can now click different award tiers to see the list of players who have earned that award.

**Highlights for Developers**
- Claims that are expired will now be automatically dropped.
- We now have the ability to restrict what roles can read/write to hubs. This may be particularly helpful for "Meta\|Team" hubs.
