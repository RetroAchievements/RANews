I played this game for Unwanted and really enjoyed it, and this final boss damageless was a real challenge to accomplish. The rest of the set is pretty comfy and you can figure it out as you play, but this one was a doozy.

I would recommend playing a very defensive style as this boss has a few tricks that can hit you really easily.

**Ability**: Sight (this locks onto the boss)

**Subweapon**: Homing Missiles (blast the boss when you're running away and being safe)

Boss abilities to watch out for:
- **Spread shot**: this this incredibly fast and will hit you if you're close or not paying attention. He starts off by doing this so dodge it by jumping and running away and fit between the shots SHMUP style.
- **Dash**: don't stand at a 45 degree (think an X is the ways he does this) as he will just launch his body and mess you up.
- **Giant beam**: again, don't stand in that X angle or he'll blast ya.
- **Rocks falling from the sky**: pretty easy to avoid, sometimes you get energy pickups for more missiles. You can just kind of run away and you're safe.

Pick away at him as safely as you can, avoiding these attacks and after a few minutes you'll burst his suit and move onto phase 2.

Phase 2 only has two attacks. A very slow windup AOE, just move out of the way and don't be close and dodge the blasts SHMUP style, and a very quickshot blaster that will get you if you're not being safe. I found just charging my shots and keeping my distance kept me safe. If you find him blasting you in the face try to jump and hopefully you'll avoid it with fast enough reaction.

Have fun with this fun quick Saturn game!
