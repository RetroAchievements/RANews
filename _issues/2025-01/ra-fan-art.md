Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

horrorqueen7 provides us with this beautiful portrait of Chun-Li from Street Fighter! This will look great in the art gallery.

Sonic looked at the Chun-li picture and suddenly thought "hey, what if I defeat Eggman with a flash kick...". Of course as always with this blue blur, he manages to pull it off without effort.

Then afterwards, Sonic was like "you know what, kicking Eggman isn't painful enough. Time for chainsaws". That escalated quickly huh. Maybe going super was a bit overkill but hey, you do you Sonic.

Eggman is probably dead by now, so Sonic decided to take on a new career: being a gangster rapper. With Snoop Hogg and 2Tailz as lead artists, this one will surely become a record label!

Alright I've had enough Sonic for now; let's talk about Dizzy the Adventurer instead, who goes out for lunch and get an omelette served! ...Does this count as cannibalism?

It's time for another Pok√©mon battle, with on one side Taz the Tazmanian Devil, and on the other Chuck Rock! This regional variant lost his legs and became a flying type... I think? Is that how it works?

Oh look, it's Sonic again... I really can't escape this blue rat huh. This time, he's cosplaying as the Universal Soldier! All things considered, this hedgehog really does fit into all sorts of shenanigans.

You know the hit game Sonic 2? It was the game that introduced Tails. But who cares for Tails when you can have the Lemmings instead? Now that would make for a not-so-speedy adventure!
