#### Essential Info & Tips

+ Links to specific sections in this guide may only work if that specific section is opened *(eg. a link to an achievement in a specific category won't work if that category's guide is not open).*

+ All achievements are single player focused, even the ones for the Multiplayer Mode, *Showdown*. A potential real Multiplayer subset could easily be made if there's enough ask for it, or if another developer wants to create one (most of the necessary RAM has been code noted).

**IMPORTANT**
> All achievements will be disabled when using cheats, unless stated otherwise. Make sure no cheat is active in the *Cheat Menu* prior to restarting or starting the required mission for the achievement. Usually a whole mission should be completed from start to finish without using cheats. The Cheat Menu is used to activate cheats. This menu can be opened via the Pause Menu and is accessible once at least 1 cheat has been unlocked via Bounty Hunter Mode.

<h1 id=Progression>
    üèÜ Story Mode <i><sub><sup>(20 achievements)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

These are the player's bread-and-butter *progresion* achievements for playing through the story. The last one under this category, Redemption, is the *win condition* for "beating" the game.

These achievements will only unlock in Story Mode, not in Bounty Hunter Mode. Any difficulty can be used to unlock these. <sup> More on difficulties, refer to [Story Mission Challenges](#StoryChallenges) </sup>

    üèÜ Story Challenges <i><sub><sup>(26 achievements)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

These achievements are a set of custom-made challenge achievements for a few select story missions. 
The challenge achievements which are allowed on *any* difficulty can also be achieved in [Bounty Hunter Mode](#BountyHunterChallenges), any others are not allowed in that mode.

Most achievements in this category require specific difficulty levels. Achievements can always be unlocked on higher difficulties than the minimum required.
- *Hard* is unlocked by completing the game on *Normal*.
- *Very Hard* and *Red Wood Revolver* are both unlocked by completing the game on *Hard*.

> #### Additional Notes
> - The player is required to finish a mission from start to finish without using any cheats. Although a select few of these custom-made challenge achievements require certain cheats to be active for the [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) to show up. The best way to be eligible for unlocking the achievement, is to activate the cheat once the mission starts. Then restart the level through the pause menu. If everything is in order, a [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) should be displayed, telling the player he's eligible for unlocking the achievement.
>
> - To access cheats, players must first unlock them by completing missions in Bounty Hunter Mode, which becomes available after finishing the game once on the selected player profile. A detailed list of which cheats correspond to specific Bounty Hunter missions can be found on the [Red Dead Fandom Wiki - Cheats](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Cheats_in_Revolver "Red Dead Fandom Wiki - Cheats"). Each unlockable cheat is tied to at least one achievement in this category.
>
> - Don't forget to turn off the cheats if they're not required for certain achievements.
>
> - As long as the [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) is active the player is eligible for unlocking the achievements under this category when the post-mission reward menu is displayed. Specific details on trigger and [measured indicators](#RA_Measure)  are documented per achievement. 
>
> - If for some reason the achievement doesn't unlock, or the [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) is not displayed. Double check the difficulty, mission and cheat requirements of the achievement then restart the level when all requirements are set correctly.

| **It Was Always About the Money**<br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/550575.png "Achievement badge icon") | - Finish a singleplayer story mission on any difficulty, where the player's bank balance at the post-mission reward menu is \$30,000 or higher. <br><br> - A [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) will be displayed during the mission, when the player's cash is at \$30,000 or higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **A Curly Deal for Carbine Zeal**<br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/533243.png "Achievement badge icon") | - In Chapter 8, "Rogue Valley", you may encounter Curly Shaw, he's the merchant the player first meets in Chapter 2, "Bounty Hunter". <br> The player can encounter him, when following the upper path after the standoff duel against the 2 bandits, mid-way through the mission. Do not go through the tunnel! If the player does go through it without encountering Curly first, he won't spawn anymore. So the player has to follow the upper path first which is blocked by rocks. Getting close to these rocks will show Curly crawling out of some hole and offer his wares to you. The item he sells is a health upgrade, which may be useful for the achievement [a_MaxHealth](#a_MaxHealth) in category [Unlocks](#Unlocks). <br> - After he spawns, he'll tell you to go through the tunnel I previously mentioned. Now it's important that Curly will partially follow the player, It's advisable that the player goes in heads first and kills the bandits as fast as possible. Once the tunnel is cleared of enemies or if you go in too deep. Curly will start running through the tunnel. This is the part where the player will want to have some Deadeye meter still available as at the exit, you'll find a few bandits across the valley, possible killing Curly. Make sure rush to the exit and kill all bandits before Curly gets shot. If the player is able to kill all bandits inside the tunnel and at the exit, Curly will drop a bag of coins worth \$1,500. <br><br> - A [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) will be displayed once the bag of coins is picked up. Finish the rest of the mission to unlock the achievement. |
|            **Deadeye**<br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/534832.png "Achievement badge icon")            | - Finish a singleplayer story mission on any difficulty, without using any Deadeye abilities, and the player's accuracy is 90% or higher at the post-mission reward menu. <br> - For math rounding reasons, the accuracy shown on the post-mission reward menu may be off by 1%. So this could potentially have the achievement not unlock when it shows 90% for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This gun is found in a crate in a small dead-end passage to the west (check the map of this level). Save the bullets for the boss fight. <br><br> - During most of the fight, Grizzly has very high defense against your damage. However, when Grizzly stops on one of the pillars and starts throwing knives, he becomes vulnerable to massive damage. Aim for headshots during this moment to conserve ammunition; otherwise, you may run out and need to retry the achievement. <br><br> - The fastest way to retry this achievement is to let your HP drop to 0, allowing you to restart from the checkpoint just before the boss. Restarting the mission via the pause menu will take you back to the beginning of the mission. <br> - Once Grizzly is defeated, the achievement will unlock once the post-mission reward menu is displayed. <br><br> - A [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed once the boss battle starts and the player has picked up "Faith". If you damage him with anything else other than "Faith", the [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) will be removed, informing you of failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

    üèÜ Bounty Hunter Mode <i><sub><sup>(20 achievements)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

The Bounty Hunter Mode is unlocked when the selected player profile has completed the Story Mode once. The player is required to finish a Bounty Hunter mission from start to finish without using any cheats. Even if a Bounty Hunter mission is already marked as *completed* on the main menu, the player can still replay the mission as a way to unlock the achievement. 

Some of these Bounty Hunter Mode challenges can be pretty hard. If you're having trouble please refer to [Walkthroughs & Resources](#WalkthroughsResources) or search any youtube video's. 

> #### Additional Notes
> - A [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) will be displayed at the post-mission overview menu when the Bounty Hunter objective has been reached. The achievement should pop around the same time that the game shows which item the player has unlocked. 
>
> - Bounty Hunter Missions which require a certain cash combo to be achieved will display a [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) during the mission once the required combo has been achieved. Finish any other objectives and the mission itself to unlock the achievement.

    üèÜ Showdown Challenges <i><sub><sup>(12 achievements)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

All of these challenge achievements revolve around the Multiplayer Mode called '*Showdown*'.

**NOTE**
> All of these Multiplayer/Showdown challenge achievements require solo play. Thus when using a multiple controllers, the achievements will not trigger. A proper Multiplayer subset could possibly be made.

> #### Additional Notes
> - A [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) will be shown on the Showdown menu/at the main menu when all required settings for a Showdown achievement are correct. This indicator will hide once the loading screen starts or when any settings are incorrect. Although this indicator is not necessary to have been displayed for the achievement to be unlocked. Only the [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) which is shown during the match is of importance.
>
> - When a [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed on the post-match overview menu, the player has completed the Showdown challenge. On pressing OK, to display the continue popup window, the achievement should unlock.
>
> - **GAME BUG**: The [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) shown when setting up the Showdown match at the main menu may not display properly when shifting through the Showdown stages too fast <sub>(the ID which checks for the selected Showdown stage may not update properly when shifting through the stages too fast...)</sub> To make the [trigger indicator](#RA_Trigger) appear properly, just don't shift through the Showdown stages too quickly. Although as mentioned above as well. This indicator is not necessary to have been displayed.
