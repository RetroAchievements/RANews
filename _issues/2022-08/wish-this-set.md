## Vanguard Bandits (PlayStation)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Console     | Genre                                               |

Vanguard Bandits is an SRPG like [Fire Emblem](https://retroachievements.org/game/7022) or [Final Fantasy Tactics](https://retroachievements.org/game/11246), but unlike those two, the gameplay is not based around how well you position a unit on the battle field or what job they have, but rather how you attack them. Some skills are more powerful, but can make you vulnerable during the enemy phase or have a low accuracy rate. When you level up, you can choose which stats you want to increase. Each stat has its own role, and sometimes upgrading them allows you to access a new skill. The game also isn't hard if you know what you are doing, with the exception of the final boss.

The story doesn't overstay it's welcome; it is very charming, like watching a 90's mecha anime with some medieval fantasy in the mix. It also has 3 routes and 4 endings, so it has a lot of replay value. The game is very short for a RPG; it's only about 17 hours long, or about 10 hours if you turn off battle animations.

You might be thinking, do we really need another Final Fantasy I set? For completion's sake, I would argue that we do. Imagine you want to play every Final Fantasy in release order. You would start with [Final Fantasy I](https://retroachievements.org/game/1449) and [II](https://retroachievements.org/game/5527) for the Famicom (1987 and 1988). Two games, two RA sets. Then you would get to 1989 and [Final Fantasy Legend](https://retroachievements.org/game/2478) for the Game Boy has a set but MSX Final Fantasy does not.

In fact, we have sets for every other Final Fantasy released until 1997! [Final Fantasy IV](https://retroachievements.org/game/17526) on PlayStation is the next time there is a break (although that was just claimed). There is also the Final Fantasy I and II Famicom 2-in-1 cartridge (1994). So, for completionist's sake, somebody should dev this set, which is also the number 1 requested set for the MSX.

## Picross DS (Nintendo DS)

Picross games might have a shaky reputation on RA for being Free Points bait and little more, but I do believe this type of game is genuinely enjoyable and encroaching for like-minded players, and this iteration of it is a shining example of why. There's a large amount of puzzles (300+) scattered among a few different modes, and the background music and overall visual presentation is very polished and pleasing, with a few different clever visual themes for your puzzle boards (for example, you could be marking blocks by eating apples or mowing grass). There's even minigames, daily challenges, DLC with previous Picross games' puzzles, and a puzzle editor! For any logic puzzle fan, this is a must have, on par with the equally great [Picross 3D](https://retroachievements.org/game/9617) on the same platform.

## Guardian's Crusade \| Knight & Baby (PlayStation)

Guardian's Crusade is the perfect kind of JRPG for achievements. Not only does it have all the usual optional content and sidequests from any solid JRPG, but it's packed to the weird, pink gills with loads of hidden STUFF. The game's cult fandom knows what I'm talking about, but the game deserves a good set to celebrate this game's hidden variety and show the rest of the world just what they missed in the 90s.

The game plays like any PSX-era JRPG, but your party is completely unique. The "Knight" from the Japanese title is your typical all-rounder, but the "Baby" is a preposterous, pink, hippopotamus-looking thing with undersized wings. The Baby can be anything you want, so long as you put in the effort. It's clear they were trying to emulate the Tamagotchi craze, but no digital pet ever let you train its battle AI, or feed it old swords to (somehow) sharpen its teeth. And then there are the Living Toys, collectable and deployable party members that can dramatically change the course of battle if you know how to use them... and can find them! Each Living Toy is stashed away somewhere in the game world and can give the completionist some powerful rewards. You'll need to backtrack to find some of them, something RPGs rarely ask, and sometimes that means new content you might not have expected!

And the story is something all its own. Guardian's Crusade was one of the early, 3D RPGs to really take a look at the whole RPG phenomenon. It's not a parody or an "anti-RPG" like [Moon](https://retroachievements.org/game/16552) the previous year, but it is a heartfelt outsider story. You're not the chosen one, you're just a weird babysitter in a world going through a legendary era. The real heroes weave in and out, as you collect your wind-up dolls, pay a scam artist to build his dream shop, and otherwise do good in a world that can't always account for everyone, like weird, hippo-babies. The game is also one of those rare few that update the world after a certain point in the plot - maybe not as drastic as some, but it keeps the world feeling alive. Some of the execution needs work, but that's only because it's shooting so high. A good game from a small team that deserves more eyes.

Plus, monsters will run away from you if you get too strong, and that's a hell of a feeling. Give it a try some day!

## Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (Arcade)

On RetroAchievements, the Capcom Jojo fighter already has 2 sets: one for the [PS1 version](https://retroachievements.org/game/14415) and one for the [original arcade version](https://retroachievements.org/game/15712). Unfortunately, the last build of the game, often referred to as Heritage for the Future, is yet to receive a set. A set for this game could be quite fun and unique. It has all the bonus characters from the PS1 version of the game, but with more fluid and refined combat. It even features new moves for some characters as well.

I think a set for HFTF could really benefit from having achievements for performing specific moves, like Jotaro and Dio's time stops and Polnareff's requiem ability, which is unique for being a reference to a later part of the manga. A set for the game could also benefit from taking inspiration from the PS1 version of the games "Secret Factor mechanic", asking players to finish off specific characters with specific moves like they were defeated in the manga.

HFTF is a very colorful and fun Capcom classic that could have a very interesting and fun set, both for fans of fighting games and of the manga series.

## Meteos (Nintendo DS)

Ever wonder what a puzzle game would look like when Nintendo's Masahiro Sakurai teams up with the brilliant minds behind games such as [Rez](https://retroachievements.org/game/3419) and [Lumines](https://retroachievements.org/game/3223)? Well, look no further! Meteos was created in an attempt to shake up the falling block genre - and, while it reviewed well critically and won a number of awards, it seems to have fallen to the wayside over the years to become more of a hidden gem than a mainstream puzzle game.

Meteos has the player protecting dozens of planets from destruction due to the impending, titular Meteos threat. This game is a match-3 at heart, and it tasks the player with moving Meteos pieces vertically in order make matches in a similar fashion to something like [Tetris Attack](https://retroachievements.org/game/815). However, instead of matched blocks just being deleted like in most games, they turn into rockets that work to push any Meteos stacked on top of them off the screen and back at the attacking forces. Larger stacks of Meteos will require more propulsion to get off the screen, which requires additional matches to be made in order to create more power or the player will run the risk of it all coming crashing back down to the board.

What makes each planet interesting is that they have different qualities from each other. Some of the bigger factors are: Meteo distribution, gravity, and width. Gravity is probably the most interesting mechanic change as it can be the difference between every Meteo instantly launching off the screen or instead needing multiple rockets for even more simple stacks. The in-game unlock system also requires different element Meteos to create new stages or items, which encourages the player to play a wide range of planets instead of just focusing on a select few.

The numerous modes and unlockables will give players plenty to do in this little gem. Take to the Star Trip mode and play through various branching modes with different endings, test your speed in Time Attack, or see how long you can endure in the endless Deluge mode. Meteos offers something for both new and old match-3 fans alike, so give it a try!

## SaGa 3: Rulers of Time and Space - Shadow or Light (Nintendo DS)

Originally this game came out in America as [Final Fantasy Legend III](https://retroachievements.org/game/700), and that is because Square was unsure if they could market their other franchises they wished to start properly like [SaGa](https://retroachievements.org/game/8364) or [Mana](https://retroachievements.org/game/7771). While the Mana series became a household name and treasure, the SaGa series had a brief love affair with [Frontier](https://retroachievements.org/game/11349) on PS1, and then was quickly known as fielding one of the worst games ever made with Unlimited Saga. This stigma stayed true for years, and you can actually spot SaGa games released by Square Enix in the 360/PS3 era hiding under different names.

So what is so good about SaGa 3? Well, it's a time travel RPG, baby! The future is doomed, and the only way to save that future is to send 3 children back in time to train and hopefully alter it. They are joined by a 4th member in the past, the child of the elder they grow up with. When it's finally time to embark on this journey, you learn you not only have this cool time ship (with an even cooler theme, called the Talon), but also that you can't fix time here, you need to go back even further in the past!

SaGa 3 plays like a typical RPG game, but where it differentiates is the ability to transform your party. In this game there are six different Species: Humans, Mutants, Beasts, Monsters, Cyborgs, and Robots. Humans have short normal ears, long-eared party members are Mutants, Beasts and Monsters eat meat from dead prey to transform, and finally the the Cyborgs/Robots install mechanical parts on themselves to abandon their humanity. In terms of complication, this is where the game hits a next level that separates it from non-SaGa RPGs.

So what is SaGa 3 on Nintendo DS? It is a celebration of a very old Game Boy game with a fresh coat of paint, and a lot of respect to make sure it didn't lose its soul for pretty colors and a remixed soundtrack.

Gotta love the series all about wrecking opponents in horrible, clearly fatal accidents and going at mach speeds through some extraordinarily windy tracks. Dominator is an undeservedly overlooked member of the Burnout series where you get high octane races in the countryside and city streets alike while enjoying Avril Lavigne singing in Mandarin.

A set for this would be exceptionally fun. Achievements for all Golds, all Dominator Challenges, and all car unlocks are a must, but there's some extra room for creative challenges. There's possibilities for achievements to beat certain non-elimination races with a specific amount of takedowns, obtaining high Burnout chains on each map, performing really long drifts, and plenty of other kinds of challenge achievements.

There's also some really solid meme potential, too. There absolutely needs to be an achievement for modifying your EA Trax list to have every single song turned Off except for the 4 different versions of Avril Lavigne's song "Girlfriend". And there's literal Burger King product placement in some of the tracks. You could make some specific note of that in an achievement for a certain race where you'll encounter some Burger King ads or something of that nature.

Overall, not only is it an amazing and extremely fun game, but it has some fantastic potential for a really fun set. I'd love to see it happen.

This is the third entry in a trilogy of PSP games all released under different names for some reason. The concept is that you play as the God of Destruction and have to help your minion, Badman, defeat pesky heroes wanting to invade his domain. Oh, and also conquer the world.

In order to do that, you can interact with the world through a terrarium view and use your pickaxe to mine blocks. Based on their properties, monsters will pop out of those. Initially it will only be basic slimes, but the more you progress, the more you will be able to generate increasingly powerful creatures. You have to balance your dungeon ecosystem carefully, as some monsters are needed to create superior ones, some will eat weaker monster for sustenance, previously defeated heroes can be raised as skeletons, etc. Once the time is up, pick up Badman, choose an emplacement for him, and watch heroes come in and try to battle their way toward him. Even if he gets captured, there is still a chance they will die on the trip back, so not all is lost! It work a bit like a tower defense and the whole premise is reminiscent of Dungeon Keeper. All in all it's a very quirky game; the characters are lovable goofy villains, and while not entirely unique in concept or execution, it is a rather uncommon play.

In term of set, there are lots of things doable between the core campaign and the bonus missions. There is a "bestiary" of sorts to track completion, and of course there could be challenge achievements imposing restrictions on the player. For leaderboards, you could have time attack as well as minimum actions, as the number of blocks you mine is tracked in-game.

3D Grand Prix is very unique for its time, released in 1985 before [Super Mario Kart](https://retroachievements.org/game/232) and [F-Zero](https://retroachievements.org/game/252). It is a first person racing game, with you in the driver seat. It is part of Super Sports II along with 3D Stunt Rider and 3D Boxing. It is also available as a standalone disc or tape. It includes eight race tracks that are based on real life circuits such as Zanduoort, Silverstone and Anderstorp. It almost works like a modern racing game where you can see driving information in cockpit including rev counter, temperature gauge and speed while the wing mirrors show opponents advancing from behind. It may become one of the unique games in the site.
