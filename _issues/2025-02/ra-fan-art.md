Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

Even though Christmas might be over, the winter season is still here and Buster Bunny decides to dress up as Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer! Is he strong enough to pull Santa's sled though?

The Addams Family has a bunch of members, but you know what they were lacking? If you guessed Sonic then yes, you were correct! ...I really can't escape that blue rat huh.

Nope, I REALLY can't escape the blue rat. But at least he's golden now? It's a classic scene of Super Sonic vs Dr. Robotnik in space! With tails playing catch-up as he somehow managed to get his plane up in space as well.

And here he is... again... invading other video games like it's nothing. Yep, it's Sonic pulling off the Ryu cosplay from Street Fighter, performing the hadouken with ease!

And here we have a classic Manci Games magazine cover! Except... it looks a little bit off. Kirby looks like he didn't have his food for a while, Lonk if your everyday guy, and Mario... actually nah, he probably did look like that at one point.

Likewise, chirpchirp96 was also in charge of making a cover, this time for Ultra Game Players magazine! His job: draw whichever character you want in a kart driving through a winter wonderland. Not sure if Spyro is the best kart racer, but at least it looks like he's having fun!

Sonic is yet again invading the world of Street Fighter, but this time he has to fight the one opponent he may not have wanted to face: his best buddy Tails! Given by how long the battle has been going on with little attacks done, suffice to say they would rather not hurt each other... but you should probably have invaded another game then Sonic!

And we end where we started, with the question answered: can Buster Bunny pull the sled of Santa? Well, assuming that Babs Bunny is Santa in this scenario, then yes he can!
