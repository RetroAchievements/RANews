SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab, having come out at the end of the GBA's life cycle, is a bit of a hidden gem. It stands apart from other SpongeBob games as it's not purely a platformer: it's got beat-em-up, racing, flying, and shooter sections. In typical WayForward fashion, the game features unrivaled sprite work and tons of love in the presentation of the game. This set includes a fun mix of challenges sprinkled throughout level sections and encourages exploration with unlocking and playing all the mini-games. So channel your inner sponge: "I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready!"

Magna Braban is a 1994 Japan-exclusive JRPG featuring automatic battles where players strategize to defeat monsters. Its charming pixel art and hilarious story captivated Western audiences, leading to a fan-made translation. The set offers a delightful mix of progression achievements and challenges. Despite its linearity and lack of secrets, these traits don’t detract from the overall fun experience it provides, making it a memorable title for fans of the genre.

Yee-haw pardner! Are you ready to save the town from the infamous outlaw Mad Dog McCree? Strap in for one of the first, if not the first, of the live-action laser disc light gun games. Due to its unique format and western setting, the game was popular arcades, and now it's at home on your Sega CD. The game has you take up the mantle of a stranger who rides into town to save the day! Grab your six-shooter and pull on your boots, and see if you have what it takes to handle the showdowns, the encounters, all of the cheesy FMV goodness.

| ⭐    | {% ragamepic 2437, 005589, Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble III %} | {% rauserpic quirky0992 %} | {% rauserpic Layton %} | 1/21/2025    |

Sure, the Game Boy version of Parasol Stars may seem tough at first, but with just a little bit of practice, it becomes a satisfying and rewarding challenge. Released only in Europe, this obscure port adapts the colorful original well, keeping the core mechanics intact while fitting the action perfectly onto the smaller screen. Do you have what it takes to master this set, filled with progression, bonus items, and boss-specific challenges that push players to master each fight? Give it a try if you like single-screen platform games with a fair learning curve.

Bust-A-Move '99 is a console port of Puzzle Bobble 3 that includes five new side modes, and this set aims to showcase absolutely everything the game has to offer: Four-way battles, 1000+ player-designed puzzles, secret characters, and more! The set has something to offer players of all skill levels: beating it is simple, but mastering it will require a true Puzzle Bobble champion. Are you ready to Bub or Bob your way to mastery?

| ⭐    | {% ragamepic 30491, 102795, Gladius %} | {% rauserpic BigDonRob %} | {% rauserpic authorblues %} | 1/29/2025    |

Gladius is a surprisingly intricate Tactical RPG, with a balance of strategy and real-time action (by way of QTEs), requiring both clever and deft gameplay. This set is designed with two playthroughs in mind, both to feature both character's stories as well as allow people to use and enjoy the Critical Meter on a playthrough before challenging the game without the augmented damage and accuracy it gives, making a "meterless" run much more difficult and emphasizing the tactical aspects of the combat. Are you ready to build the greatest gladiator school in and around Imperia?

|      | {% ragamepic 12177, 094043, Heavy Barrel %} | {% rauserpic makeuseun %} | {% rauserpic Sutarion %} | 1/30/2025    |

If you’re a fan of classic run-and-gun action, Heavy Barrel is calling your name. This retro gem throws you into the thick of it, from blasting through waves of tanks and choppers to assembling the ultimate weapon—the Heavy Barrel itself. Whether you’re aiming to clear all six stages, rack up a massive high score, or pull off the ultimate flex of taking down the final boss with the Heavy Barrel, there’s no shortage of challenges to keep you hooked. And don’t forget the thrill of stacking up extra lives or chasing that perfect run without continuing. It’s a chaotic, adrenaline-pumping ride that’s as rewarding as it is tough. So gear up, lock in, and see if you’ve got what it takes to conquer this classic.

| Grad | Set                                                          | Jr. Developer              | Reviewer                 | Review  Date |

Tom and Jerry in Mouse Attacks is a classic licensed platformer for the Game Boy Color starring the iconic cat and mouse duo. In this game, Jerry is trying to save his captured friends from Tom, through creative puzzle platforming and unique minigames to acquire gadgets to progress. This set has a variety of challenges that should stump even the craftiest rodent.
