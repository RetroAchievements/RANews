# Small FAQ

## What does Cherry Tree Rank mean?

Cherry Tree Rank refers to the ranking you earn at the end of a boss fight, or the ranking you may earn at the end of the game. Cherry Tree is equivalent to an "S-Rank" in games like Devil May Cry. The worse you perform (Time taken, damage dealt to you) the worse your rank becomes.

***

## What is a Artifact / Holy Artifact?
Artifacts are items you collect throughout your adventure that can be equipped in the Equipment section while playing. These usually change aspects of Amaterasu, such as having a longer range on item pickups, infinite health, or infinite ink. Some artifacts you are required to obtain throughout the story, while others are rewards for trading in Demon Fangs. These will be blocked for the challenge achievements as some of them do break the battle system.

***

## What is the symbol in the bottom left of the screen? Why is it sometimes different colors?
This is what's known as Godhood. Godhood is a protecting barrier that surrounds Amaterasu that negates damage dealt to her. There are 3 levels in total, each level negating only 1 attack. If you lose level 3 Godhood, you go to Level 2, and so on. There are two ways to increase your godhood level

* Perform attack combos
* Use Travelers or Godly Charms

For any of the Boss challenges / Cherry Tree Rank Challenges, you may go into the fight with Max Godhood obtained.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7uAH1vI.png)

***
## The cutscenes are so long. Can I skip them?
Yes, but only once you've beaten the game once, and not every cutscene can be skipped sadly. This is a shortcoming of the game, so if it bothers you then you may always wait until NG+ to try some of theese 

***

## What Divine Instrument should I use? Beads? Glaives? Reflectors?

Okami is a wonderfully balanced game created by a team of people who really understand how to create a battle system: every weapon is viable and this is totally up to choice. My preference has always been Glaives; you can charge them up for devastating attacks which can make many fights trivial. Reflectors have the ability to, well, reflect. By pressing Triangle, you can reflect and counter some attacks. You'll know you have done a successful counter as Amaterasu will grab the enemy, throw them in the air, then strike down on the enemy. Beads are an attempt at range attacks, some can be chained together like a whip while others can be shot out like a gun. Weapons can also be upgraded to be more powerful with gold dust, which can be purchased or found throughout the game. Once you find what weapon you like the most, upgrade it with gold dust.

* Reflectors - A balance between offense and defense
* Glaives - Heavy hits with an emphasis on offense
* Beads - Ranged attacks that deal more combos per hit than other weapons.

***

## What are Stray Beads? How do I get them?
There is a much more comprehensive guide with pictures on where / how to obtain every stray bead. I have outlined some of them within the set, but not all of them have their own individual achievements.
[Click here for a Stray Bead road map!](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/221040-okami-hd/faqs/79107/stray-beads)

There are 100 Stray Beads in total. Each are numbered, so they should be easy to track to find which one you're missing.

***

# End Game Achievements
At the conclusion of Okami, you are presented with a final results screen that assesses your overall performance. There are five achievements associated with this, some of which require you to monitor your progress throughout the entire playthrough.

| {% raachpic 246974, 273571, Immortality, a God's Best Friend (25) %} | Earn a Cherry Tree Ranking on "Total Deaths" on the final results screen |

To achieve this, you need to complete the game with no more than four Game Overs and Continues. If you die, reset the emulator and load your most recent save. Deaths will only be recorded if you choose to use a "Continue" after a game over.

| {% raachpic 246975, 273572, Money Makes Nippon Go-Round (10) %} | Earn a Cherry Tree Ranking on "Total Yen Collected" on the final results screen |

Achieve a total savings of 4 million yen or more. There are no restrictions on your spending; this reflects only the overall amount collected.

| {% raachpic 246976, 273573, God of War (25) %} | Earn a Cherry Tree Ranking on "Total Enemies Defeated" on the final results screen |

Defeat 550 or more enemies during your adventure. This achievement will be relatively easy to achieve if you are actively defeating enemies for Demon Fangs and/or working to complete the bestiary.

| {% raachpic 246977, 273574, Mid-evil Dentistry (25) %} | Earn a Cherry Tree Ranking on "Total Demon Fangs" on the final results screen |

Collect 300 or more Demon Fangs throughout your adventure. Easy to complete alongside [God of War (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/246976). There are many methods to earning Demon Fangs, such as countering an enemy successfully with a Karmic Transformer, using the Golden Fury or Brown Rage Dojo moves, or the simplest; finishing a demon by cutting it in half with the Power Slash brush technique. Get into the habit of doing this as early as possible, by the time you reach the end of the game you should have many accumulated. This is also counting the total earned, so you may spend them on items.

| {% raachpic 246978, 273575, Praise the Sun! (25) %} | Earn a Cherry Tree Ranking on "Total Praise" on the final results screen |

Accumulate 4,500 or more Praise throughout your journey. This task is more straightforward than it may seem. Be sure to feed every animal you encounter, revitalize any dead trees using Bloom, and search for as many clovers as possible. Similar to Yen and Demon Fangs, you may use as much Praise as you wish, as the total amount accumulated is what counts.

| {% raachpic 246961, 273558, Giving Thanks (50) %} | Dig up and bloom every Clover (See achievement comments) |

`MISSABLE` `MISCELLANEOUS`

This achievement involves finding and blooming every clover in the game. Some are obvious with large beams of lights, others are hidden in secret caves or on platforms that are out of the way. The key to mitigating stress from this achievement is to take it one area at a time.

Here is a guide that encompasses all animals and clovers in each area.
<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1230948257>

| {% raachpic 246956, 273553, Itadakimasu (50) %} | Feed 100% of every animal in your Animal Tome (see achievement comments) |

`MISSABLE` `MISCELLANEOUS`

Across Nippon there are animals that Amaterasu can feed in order to obtain more Praise. Some of these are by themselves, others are in groups. It's important to keep at least a handful of all forms of feed in your inventory throughout the game, in case you encounter any along your journey. There are animals that can be missed, so just like with Clovers, take this in a area by area basis.

Here is a guide that encompasses all animals and clovers in each area.

# Achievement Guide

| {% raachpic 246874, 273472, I Love the Elderly (1) %} | Dry Mrs. Orange's Laundry |

`MISCELLANEOUS`

Find Mrs. Orange by Susano's house. Use Rejuvenation and create a new clothes pole for her, then be a sweet doggie and make the sun come out to dry her laundry.

***

| {% raachpic 469260, 273473, Hole-Digging King (3) %} | Break Hayabusa's Turnip digging record |

`MINI-GAME`

First achievement that stumps new players who aren't used to the nuance of the controls of Okami. You must get dig up 9 turnips in a row without being hit; a very simple trick for this is to dig at the furthest turnip away from Mushi's Mama. Once she starts coming towards you, lure her near and go into brush mode and paint some ink over her. This will "stun" her by covering her in ink; while she is busy cleaning herself off, you have another couple of seconds to dig one or two more turnips. Repeat this and the achievement is yours.

| {% raachpic 246900, 273498, Shungoku-satsu ! ! ! (1) %} | Witness the Raging Demon cook up some delicious cakes |

`MISCELLANEOUS`

Go to Mr. and Mrs. Orange's house at night, then speak to Mrs. Orange

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2wCAdZN.png" width="480">

***

| {% raachpic 469261, 273527, Let Me Tell You About My Best Friend (2) %} | Show off Susano to every villager in Kamiki (Including both statues of Nagi) before he destroys the boulder |

`MISSABLE` `MISCELLANEOUS`

To leave Kamiki village, you'll need the help of Susano. At some point, you will pick him up and put him on your back. When this happens, leave his house and speak to every member of Kamiki Village, other than the Merchant pushing the boulder. 
The residents are
* Mr. Orange (On the large platform overlooking the village)
* Mrs. Orange (Doing her laundry near the river by Susano's house)
* Mushi (By the Turnip field)
* Mushi's Mama (In the turnip field)
* Kushi (At her house with the watermill)
* Komuso (The monk playing the flute on the pathway to Sakuya's Tree)
* Camille (Near Sakuya's Tree)
* Then go through the spirit gate, cross the River of the Heavens, and return to the large statue of Nagi

| {% raachpic 246892, 273490, Waka Faces the Music (10) %} | Without using any items or artifacts, defeat Waka 1 and earn a Cherry Tree Rank |

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

Waka is nice enough to telegraph all of his attacks at a reasonable speed. When Waka is standing still or when he is approaching you, go into Brush mode and drop a cherry bomb near him - once he touches it, it will detonate and deal a good amount of damage towards him. If he throws a sword, go into Brush mode and Power Slash it - it will return back to him and he will turn "grey". When this happens, he is open for a Power Slash. Do this a couple of times and he'll go down quickly.

| {% raachpic 246897, 273493, Dethroned! (10) %} | Without using any items or artifacts, defeat the Spider Queen and earn a Cherry Tree Rank" |

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

The Spider Queen seems a lot more intimidating than she looks. As soon as the fight starts, sprint and start running around her in a clockwise direction. Go into Brush mode and attach vines from the upside down blossoms to the circular canes on her back. Once you do, she will be stunned and the flower on her back will open up, revealing her eyeballs. Go into brush mode and line up a Power Slash on at least more than 1 eyeball that you can see. Rinse and repeat quickly until her eyeballs start to die and vanish. This will more than likely take more than 1 cycle, but you should have enough time to do it again without worrying about the timer rank. After about 2 cycles, she should be dead.

***

| {% raachpic 246897, 273495, Ya Half-Baked Prophet! (10) %} | Without using any items or artifacts, defeat the Waka 2 and earn a Cherry Tree Rank" |

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

This is more or less the exact same fight as before, although Waka is a bit faster and deals more damage. The key is to keep your distance from him while reflecting his sword back to him. Keep dropping cherry bombs on his feet and he will stand no chance.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/76dXkNI.png" width="480">

***

| {% raachpic 246966, 273563, Sleepier Than the Average Bear (5) %} | Give Sleepy the Bear a Beehive to stand...or, sleep on |

`MISCELLANEOUS`

On the connection path between Shinshu Field and Agata Forest, you'll find Sleepy the Bear. This side quest involves bringing several round objects to him to see which he likes the most.

1. A large cabbage at the bottom of the path leading up to Sleepy.
2. A Walnut close to Karude, behind a rock.
3. A beehive hanging on a branch beneath a floating Konohana Blossom. Use Power Slash to get it down.

My advice would be to roll the items to the left side of the mountain wall when rolling up to Sleepy, as the mechanics are not the most friendly to rolling in a straight line. You may find that the objects you're rolling can just go off in the opposite direction, or even off the cliff entirely. Slow and steady wins this race; try not to dash as the faster you go the less control you have over the object you're pushing.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OTro99O.png" width="480">

***

| {% raachpic 246930, 273528, Damsel in Distress (1) %} | Try to help Kushi with her Sake barrel in Shinshu Field |

`MISSABLE`

At this point in the story you should be exploring for the last remaining Canine Warriors. You will eventually be lead to Agata Forest, where you will end up freeing Ume from the legendary fish known as **WHOPPER**. After freeing Ume, you will then fight him for his canine warrior orb. After this fight concludes, go up to the top of Agata Forest near the connecting point between Shinshu Field - exit the forest and you will find Kushi struggling with her Sake Barrel; speak to her and earn the achievement. This must be done before heading into Kamiki village to find the last Canine Warrior.

***

| {% raachpic 246906, 273504, Reduced to Ashes (10) %} | Without using any items or artifacts, defeat Crimson Helm and earn a Cherry Tree Rank |

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

Another boss fight. Crimson Helm is a raging bull enemy type, so expect him to come straight at you for his attacks. If he charges at you, double jump out of the way and drop a cherry bomb right in front of his face before he finishes his charge. His other attack is jumping and landing, causing a wave of fire to shoot out; simply double jump over them. Once he's taken enough damage he will become stunned, so you take revenge and rush him! He won't take any damage until his armor is knocked off and you've blown the fire surrounding his bones away. Once he's naked, lay a full assault of attack combos and Power Slashes and he will be vanquished.

| {% raachpic 246907, 273505, Don't Stop the Music (3) %} | Take Kushi through Shinshu Field to the entrance of the Moon Cave without getting into any battles (Go back to Kamiki to reset) |

`MISSABLE` `MISCELLANEOUS`

At this point in the story, Orochi has sent a sacrificial arrow marking the top of Kushi's residence, and dooming her to a horrible fate. She asks Amaterasu to carry her through Shinshu field towards the Moon Cave so that she may offer herself to Orochi. Kushi will change her outfit and sit on Amaterasu's back, and when this happens the music will change to be a triumphant, yet somber song called "Kushi's Ride". 

Take Kushi through Shinshu Field towards to Moon Cave without being stopped by any enemy scrolls along the way. If you get near a Demon Scroll, go into Brush Mode and slash it to stun it. If you run near the Blue Scrolls, you will not be able to stun them, so keep your distance. Feel free to leap off of ledges as well - there is no fall damage, so take as many escape routes as you can.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lp5kFtd.png" width="480">

| {% raachpic 246911, 273509, Celestial Cleaver (10) %} | Without using any items or artifacts, defeat Orochi and earn a Cherry Tree Rank |

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

Finally, you have reached the dreaded Orochi! Orochi's fight is a long puzzle, but not difficult. He has 8 heads, all with different attacks and weaknesses, but they all have the same attack "pattern". The head will attack you if you're too close with a physical attack, but if you stand near the platform further away then they will commence their elemental attack.

* Fire - The Fire head will attack by blowing fire towards Ammy. Use Gale Force to blow it away
* Dark - The Dark head will spit putrid plants out. Use Bloom on them before they burst open.
* Wind - The Wind head will send a tornado that will follow Ammy's movements. Use Gale force to blow in the opposite direction to cancel it out.
* Water - The Water head will fill the battlefield with water, where smaller Orochi snakes will swim and attack. Land on a lily pad and slash its head to make it stop flooding the arena.
* Light - The Light head will shoot laser beams down towards Ammy. Jump to dodge them easily.
* Earth - The Earth head will send tremors through the ground. Jump to avoid them.
* Lightning - The Lightning head will send balls of electricity downward. Jump to avoid them.

After making each head drink the 8 Purification Sake, Orochi will become drunk. Attack the bell on his back, and once its health has been reduced enough Phase 2 will start. You will repeat the same tactics, attacking each head. This time, the heads have more physical attacks (Such as a left and right swipe attack and a lunging bite attack) and the bell will be shooting fire downward in different directions intermittently. Stay to the back of the arena to bait the head into lunging towards you, while keeping your distance from the fireballs being dropped from above. Make each head drink the 8 Purification Sake again and unleash all your attacks and kill each one.

`MISSABLE` `MISCELLANEOUS`

Once you finish off Orochi, a festival will begin! You can spend the festival by visiting everyone who is celebrating to see what their thoughts are. Go through the spirit gate near Sakuya's tree, cross the River of the Heavens, and return to the large statue of Nagi. There you'll find Susano and Kushi expressing their feelings to one another. Be a freak and start talking to them over and over again until Issun tells you to leave. 

Ammy, two is great, but three's a crowd. Ha ha ha.

`MISSABLE` `MISCELLANEOUS`

Should be fairly obvious. I will not explain why it is marked missable, but it is best to do this as soon as you meet Rao.

| {% raachpic 246914, 273512, Can't Torture Me Any Longer (3) %} | Kill the Seaweed demon in the Sunken Ship |

`MISCELLANEOUS`

Revenge is best served with Seaweed. In the Sunken Ship, you are repeatedly attacked by a giant Seaweed Demon. Eventually, you will have to lower the water level within the ship using the Sun and the Moon to your advantage. When the water lowers, the Seaweed Demon becomes vulnerable. Two spiked barrels will be near by once the water is lowered; make your way there, jump on a barrel, and roll it towards the demon. Keep rolling it over until the Demon dies.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SBnrBQw.png" width="480">

**WARNING**
Before entering the Emperor in the Imperial Palace, there is a single missable enemy on the floor of the Emperor's Room. The enemy is the Flame Doom Mirror, which does not reappear. This room becomes inaccessible once Blight has been defeated.

| {% raachpic 246918, 273516, Stomach Full of Samurai (1) %} | Without using any items or artifacts, defeat Blight and earn a Cherry Tree Rank |

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

Time to face Blight inside the stomach of the emperor. The key to this fight is that when blight summons a circle of swords, you Power Slash a good chunk of them in one slash. Try to get the blue one so it reflects back towards him, which leaves him open for attacks. When he teleports, use Veil Mist to catch him as he is traveling from one point to another - he is a sitting duck during this. I find that he is easiest to take down when using Glaives, especially if you use the charging attack on him while he is teleporting and you've stopped him with Veil Mist.

| {% raachpic 246926, 273524, In Bloom (3) %} | Help Mr. Flower restore the Cherry Blossoms of Sei'an City |

`MISCELLANEOUS`

Now that Blight's curse has been lifted, Mr. Flower wishes to make Sei'an look beautiful once more. All that you need to do for this is stay focused on where he jumps from tree to tree. Using an Inkfinity stone helps greatly. If you have it, equip the Water Tablet so you don't have to constantly make lily pads for when he jumps over the river.

| {% raachpic 246927, 273525, Ay, I'm Floatin' Here! (2) %} | Help the Aspiring Carpenter across Sei'an city with your makeshift-ferry |

`MISCELLANEOUS`

Once the river has been fully restored in Sei'an City, you'll have the ability to take several NPC's over the water on lily pads. 3 of these NPC's can be repeatedly taken across the water, while one cannot be repeated. This is the Aspiring Carpenter. The lilypad minigame might not make a lot of sense at first, but all you need to think about is the direction of the wind you create with Gale Force. Gale Force usually goes to either the left or the right, but you can manipulate this by changing the camera while in Brush Mode

`COLLECTIBLE`

Time to put your brush skills to the test. To start this sidequest, you must purchase Charcoal from the Tool Dealer first. After that, you will see a little girl who is drawing on the ground in the Commoner's Quarters of Sei'an. Speak to her, then make note of the design in her thought bubble. Go to Mr. Chic and recreate the same design on a Kimono. Mr Chic should say "That pattern almost seems as if it could make something happen". Go back to the little girl and see another design from her. Most of these are easy, except for the last one. Unless you know Kanji, it's going to take a couple of tries.

`COLLECTIBLE`

This achievement first requires you to speak to Camille and Camellia at the top of Kamiki Village. Camille does not believe in the gods, but Camellia can clearly see the markings on Amaterasu. Bloom flowers in front of them, then headbutt Camille to make her believe that she is not in a dream. After this, both sisters will move to Sei'an City. Here you will have to prove your existence to them once more - this time however you need to make a tree sprout, then spray the tree with the secret technique Deluge after the tree has vanished.

`COLLECTABLE`

Komuso is a traveling monk who is plagued by demons throughout his travels. He will ask you to help him during several points of your story. None of these are missable, you just need to encounter them in order.
1. Kamiki Village - Near the middle point between the peak of the village. You should hear his flute once you run up the stairs by Mr. Oranges house.
2. Kusa Village - Komuso can be found in a small bamboo grove, underneath the wooden walkway to the Gale Shrine within Kusa Village.
3. Sei'An City: Aristocratic Quarter - When going to the Emperor's Palace, look to the left side to see Komuso playing his flute underneath a tree. Talk to him one more time to initiate the last of his requests. 

These are timed arena challenges where must fight a particular amount of demons before time runs out. Most of these fights are trivial, and you may use whatever means at your disposal to win.

`COLLECTIBLE`

Throughout the game, you will encounter Demon Gates, arenas where you will have to clear all enemies without being able to leave. There are three in particular which are unlike the other gates; these 3 are gauntlets. You will defeat wave after wave of enemy with an increase in difficulty for each wave. Before you can unlock each Trial, you must defeat a [Bandit Spider](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/okami/images/7/7a/Bandit_spider_concept_art.png/revision/latest?cb=20200205232039)

1. Ryoshima Coast - Small alcove near some cows near the first Guardian Sapling.
2. North Ryoshima Coast - Located on an island near 3 other islands on the western side. Isn't available until after you clear Oni Island.
3. Kamui - The hardest of all three. On top of a Frozen waterfall near the entrance to Wep'keer, hidden behind a bombable crater. Only available until after you've defeated Lechku and Nechku. 

Taking a quote from Neoseeker's Okami guide...
* Keep your godhood up by using Charms and doing combos
* Use Veil of Mist to your advantage
* Use Vengeance Slips to wipe out enemies who are lower on health
* Use Steel Fist Sake to increase your attack
This might be the hardest achievement in the set, but you are allowed to use any artifacts that you can find.

Several items in Sei'an City's Commoner Quarter have gone missing! The culprit is of course, closer than you think. Light every torch around the City, and use Power Slash on the giant boulder standing beside a soldier keeping watch. Hayazo the thief will pop out and challenge you to a race. There are four races in all, each rewarding you a different item upon completion. Hayazo has 4 forms, all weak to various brush strokes

* [Inferno](https://okami.neoseeker.com/wiki/Inferno): Red

* [Power Slash](https://okami.neoseeker.com/wiki/Power_Slash): Black
* [Waterspout](https://okami.neoseeker.com/wiki/Waterspout): Blue

The fourth race is only available once you have cleared Oni Island. I end up waiting to do this particular race until I have unlocked Thunder Edge, as it is a source of infinite electricity, which can only be found on top of the ghost known as Raiden. Your chances of success will increase dramatically once you have Thunder Edge, or the secret brush technique Thunderbolt.

All this achievement requires is good camera movement. Walk into the middle of the room before you meet the Blockhead, you  should see several lightning strikes inside. Right beside one of those indoor clouds is a breakable wall. Go into brush mode, pan the camera upwards, then draw a cherry bomb on the spot. After its exploded, jump with the camera facing the hole, go into brush mode at the peak of your jump, then find the Blossom and use vine to sling Amaterasu through the section.

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

Bit of a tricky fight to get down on your first attempt. Ninetails will hold his sword up as the fight starts, so make sure you make use of the lightning surrounding the area. Ninetails is invincible otherwise, but once he is hit by lightning he will split into multiple forms of Evil Rao. If you have the Fireburst technique already, this would be the time to use it as it attacks multiple enemies in an area. If you do not have it, the easiest way to start taking out the Evil Rao's is to line them up in Brush Mode and strike them with a power strike and, of course, dropping cherry bombs on multiple groups when possible. The time for this fight is a little more generous than it would seem, so don't stress if you miss one or two. Once all are defeated, Ninetails will turn into his true form and will be vulnerable to damage. He will try to charge you with a spinning strike - double jump out of the way enough times and he will get dizzy. Proceed to lay into him accordingly.

Yoichi is one of the archers that Amaterasu meets at the checkpoint before reaching Ryoshima Coast, the skinny one with the bow and arrow. After the checkpoint explodes (thanks to Ammy's influence), Yoichi leaves his station to go to North Ryoshima near the Guardian Sapling on the small island to the north, then he ends up in Kamui facing a giant stone with a sun drawn on the side. In order to trigger this achievement, you must meet Yoichi 3 separate times and help his arrow find its mark
- Once at the City Checkpoint
- Once at North Ryoshima Coast
- Once in Kamui

Yoichi will LEAVE Ryoshima Coast once you make it to Kamui, so make sure you do this sidequest before entering.

| {% raachpic 246955, 273552, Wolf On Wolf Action (10) %} | Without using any items or artifacts, defeat Oki and earn a Cherry Tree Rank |

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT` 

This is the first real challenging boss now that we are reaching the end of the adventure; Oki has two forms
- Human form, which attacks like Evil Rao and Waka, summoning swords that can be slashed away with a Power Slash and has easier attacks to predict
- Wolf form, a fight incredibly similar to the other Dog fights in the game, and is the hardest one of all.

Oki's wolf form can become invincible once he howls or gets a blue aura around him, where he will end up charging at you. Like other bosses, plan where he will end his charge and drop a cherry bomb on top of him to deal massive damage. Keep your distance and focus on using brush attacks for a safe play, but charged up glaive attacks can deal large amounts of damage as well. If you want to be riskier, perform a double jump and charge your glaive, then release for a downward strike on top of him. You can also use veil mist to slow him down.

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

The final human fight - once again similar to Waka, Evil Rao, and Oki. He will summon swords above his head. Throw Veil Mist on him to slow him down. Nagi deals a lot of damage, so make sure that you keep yourself away from his sword (it has a long reach). Focus on dropping cherry bombs while he stands still and summons his swords, or while he is walking towards you.

**WARNING**
Before fighting True Orochi, there is another missable enemy, the Clay Flyer. This enemy can be fought outside of Kamiki Village 100 years ago in the surrounding area of Shinshu Field. This enemy will not reappear once you leave the Spirit Gate.

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

Almost exactly like the previous fight with Orochi; just focus on countering each head. He deals more damage and has more health, but he will go down in the same way as before. The fire that rains down from his 2nd phase attack also strikes a bit faster, so be observant of your positioning near each head so you don't get cornered by both the head and a flaming spire of fire.

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

New boss fight; this is more of an RNG puzzle than the other fights. Both owls have attacks that can be fired back at them, focus on doing that and countering all of their attacks with Power Slash (all but ice). Lechku (Gold) will hold up his sword occasionally, make sure to strike him down with lightning, here's a tip; now that you have Thunder Edge you can use it to cast Thunderbolt from Amaterasu to whatever you wish to strike with lightning, this way you don't have to worry about your position in proximity to the nearest cloud. Nechku (Silver) loves throwing bombs your way, make sure you steer clear or them or explode them on your own with fireburst. You'll be prompted eventually to shoot Oki out like a cross-bolt, knocking one of them down. Feel free to go crazy and deal as much damage as you possibly can. Be weary of their dive attacks, the worst part is how it can change the camera. Try to double jump over or strafe/dodge out of the way in time. If you're worried about the timing, keep a bit of ink left to do veil of mist. Rinse and repeat until both are vanquished.

| {% raachpic 246973, 273570, Rising Sun (50) %} | Without using any items or artifacts, defeat Yami and earn a Cherry Tree Rank |

`MISSABLE` `BOSS FIGHT`

Phase 1: 
<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/67cb2ad52f8091a1c6f9a398210895c9151aee8bf12c40d2ade77838a37117d6/68747470733a2f2f7374617469632e77696b69612e6e6f636f6f6b69652e6e65742f6f6b616d692f696d616765732f302f30392f59616d695f636f6e636570745f6172745f322e706e672f7265766973696f6e2f6c61746573743f63623d3230323030323035323333393538" width="240">


The end is finally here; all of your brush skills have been stripped, so this first fight relies on your ability to platform and sneak in a hit or two while defending yourself. Yami will jump up and slam down onto the arena as well as slam a hammer onto certain section to smash holes in the floor. Steer clear of them as if you fall it takes more and more time and damage off of your ranking. Run towards him and slam him with an attack from your divine instrument, he should get weak and drop Power Slash. One of Yami's defensive moves is to launch rockets in the air, then towards Ammy. If you dont have Power Slash, go for a full sprint and carefully watch Ammy's positioning before a rocket sweeps into her. Destroy his rockets with Power Slash. Deal enough damage and prepare for phase 2.

Phase 2:
<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e0d72d2c439a1213088b9cdbbd9759a652aef70895935316f51405e8d561aa57/68747470733a2f2f7374617469632e77696b69612e6e6f636f6f6b69652e6e65742f6f6b616d692f696d616765732f332f33322f59616d695f636f6e636570745f6172745f352e706e672f7265766973696f6e2f6c61746573743f63623d3230323030323035323332313339" width="240">

This phase is slightly more annoying. He should start off by covering himself in flames and steering himself towards Ammy. Make sure you keep running and watch for his patterns, he seems to prefer a star shape. Once he's done being ablaze, strike him and take back the power of Cherry Bomb! You know what to do by know - Start dropping bombs and he should pop open like a matryoshka doll. Jump up onto his platforms and start striking the little fish, thats Yami's Heart and true form! Defend yourself with waterspout and keep striking until he's had enough.

Phase 3:
<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c6b9fbe582b24ee10d9fc46d55fed3f1ea0c70c4c4fe76dc9c3122dc5a93fd6d/68747470733a2f2f7374617469632e77696b69612e6e6f636f6f6b69652e6e65742f6f6b616d692f696d616765732f322f32332f59616d695f636f6e636570745f6172745f342e706e672f7265766973696f6e2f6c61746573743f63623d3230323030323035323332313337" width="240">

This phase tests patience more than any of the others. In this mode, Yami becomes a slot machine. Go into brush mode to stop his reels. There doesn't seem to be a pattern on what you get for drops, but if you roll three of the light blue orbs with a hand coming from the bottom right, Yami will open up and expose his weak point. Try to aim for those. What you roll like fire and lightning is self explanatory, but the small one eyed monster symbol launches explosive balls towards Ammy. Launch them back with Power Slash. The fire that he sprays here is what kills a lot of runs, so be careful in your movements. This is a very RNG heavy phase, so be prepared for this to take up more of your time then the previous and the next.

Phase 4:
<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a784f4cc7a41242267ff838b73156995ca4b48b6985ccad26b16ce223baea589/68747470733a2f2f7374617469632e77696b69612e6e6f636f6f6b69652e6e65742f6f6b616d692f696d616765732f652f65612f59616d695f636f6e636570745f6172745f332e706e672f7265766973696f6e2f6c61746573743f63623d3230323030323035323334303031" width="240">

This phase has Yami turn into a sumo-esc mech. Occasionally, the front panel will open and expose Yami - Be sure to Power Slash it or damage it with your instrument for some easy damage. In this phase, Yami will fire a gigantic beam of energy from his face, but you can easily double jump over it; right after, he usually fires a beam going from downward to upward, then a beam sweeping at his feet. He will sweep with his tentacle arms and launch missiles above which you can deflect back. Once you get enough small shots on him he will start dropping more of your brush techniques. Once you get thunderstorm, you can shock him by either using the storms or Thunder Edge; once he's shocked, he will fall onto his face with his rear end exposing his true form.

Phase 5:
<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9a7703d22e088e0d5e5db661ed94680071293533ad7c6dabb882ea6a9b3e6000/68747470733a2f2f7374617469632e77696b69612e6e6f636f6f6b69652e6e65742f6f6b616d692f696d616765732f622f62652f59616d695f636f6e636570745f6172745f312e706e672f7265766973696f6e2f6c61746573743f63623d3230323030323035323332313336" width="240">

After a heartfelt (and very long) cutscene, Amaterasu is finally facing the ultimate form of Yami. Once the fight starts, immediately draw a sun in the sky to brighten up the battlefield. Yami should throw down his true form, leaving it obviously exposed. Lay into it with everything you've got, Power Slashes, bombs, and combos. His attacks are quick, so keep enough of a distance from him so you're not locked in the center when he sweeps or tries to grab you. Occasionally, he will throw his true form above him and fire a laser - before he gets the chance, use Power Slash to stun him once more. If he sends a tornado your way, counter it with one of your own. As a fully powered god, he should stand no chance against your arsenal.
