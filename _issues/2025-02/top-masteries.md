## Intro

We are going to take a look at another metric for greatness, Mastery Awards. Mastery awards are given to users when they complete every achievement for a given set in hardcore mode. Users wear mastery awards as a badge of honor on their profile page representing all the hard work they put into truly becoming a master of the game.

Below we will take a look at which users rank among the best with the most mastery awards in several categories well as notable updates from the previous month to each individual category. Check to see how you rank among the rest of the community members.

Special thanks to {% rauserpic Nydaxn %} for creating the ranking image templates.

\* Data as of February 1st 2025.
