## Terraria Standalone

Terraria found its way into our lives in 2011 and remains one of the best indie games ever released, with constant updates such as Journey’s End, Journey’s Actual End and most recently Labor of Love because they just can't stop supporting their fans.
This has led to extensive mod tools, a thriving modding scene and now, {% rauserpic timenoe %} has created a mod that integrates the game with RetroAchievements!

|                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {% ragamepic 32909, 107179, Terraria %}                                |
| {% ragamepic 32910, 107695, Terraria [Subset - Completionist] %}       |
| {% ragamepic 32929, 107699, Terraria [Subset - Player Difficulties] %} |
| {% ragamepic 32911, 107700, Terraria [Subset - World Modes & Seeds] %} |

To get started, you'll need [tModLoader](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader) on Steam, you'll then be able to find the RA mods in the in-game mod browser.
It requires that you already own Terraria.

## Discord Revamp

Over the years, our community has grown significantly, and the Discord server has been a major part of that. With this much growth, it was a difficult task to keep the server nice and tidy, and many people felt it was hard to navigate. For that reason, there have been several changes to the entire Discord that aim to:

- Have the server become more welcoming to (new) users.
- Easier to navigate by more carefully using categories to separate channels.
- Distinguish channels with emojis to better demonstrate what the purpose of each channel is.
- Preparations in case of future channel additions.
