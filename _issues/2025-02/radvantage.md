| {% raachpic 143307, 538256, The Yoshis are in another Egg! %} | Defeat Sunnycide without freeing a single Yoshi. | 10     |

Although it's worth only 10 points, it is missable and requires patience & strategy. The achievement requires not freeing a single Yoshi during the battle. The developer provides us with a meaningful, fun, and thought-provoking challenge. Freeing a Yoshi will expedite the defeat of the enemy since Yoshi will attack the foe thereby significantly reducing their defense. Indeed, that would make the battle finish much sooner. But RA asks us to bring the A game...prove you can win the harder way.
Regular attacks don't yield much damage. Enter the battle making sure you're stocked up on Green Shells and Cannonballers, I recommend at least 10 each but better to have more. Those are single foe target items; using them to target Sunnycide only makes it impossible to harm any Yoshi egg. Perfect. Counter/dodge any attacks to minimize damage. Heal as needed but might not be often if you're skilled at countering/dodging. If / when Sunnycide tosses ALL eggs leaving themself without peers, you can now safely use a target all Bros. Item such as Bro Flowers for higher damage than the other single target items! It'll take some time but following this plan will earn this clever missable.
