# Episode 25 - Level Up! Growing Stronger

Hello everyone, welcome back and thank you for tuning in with us for another episode of  The RetroAchievements Podcast, where we cover a variety of genres, topics, and discuss the bits and bytes of yesteryear!

Tonight we are digging back in on what brought us all together in the first place, the games. Whether you started on the Colecovision or the latest generation of Xbox, a bit of escapism into a world of adventure is always appreciated.

These adventures allowed you to complete feats never thought possible. They carried you through a journey of trials and proving points, demanding you grow stronger and develop. Be that learning a new technique the mechanics require, or literally equipping yourself with a legendary weapon pumping your damage into the roof, the satisfaction of noticeable growth gives a unique enjoyment other media struggles to capture. 

For exactly that reason I have my guest here tonight, {% rauser Ghal416 %}, to dig in on their experience at RA, and some games that really bring that aforementioned satisfaction.
