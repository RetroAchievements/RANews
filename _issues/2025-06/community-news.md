## Hash Compatibility Testing

The QA-team is happy to announce a new process for hash compatibility testing! This allows users to help test hash compatibility for existing sets. You can work with the developer on testing new hashes while mastering the set to verify compatibility.

More information can be found in the docs at [Player Compatibility Testing](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/player-compatibility-testing.html).

## PlayTester Revamp

The PlayTester team has been revamped in order to expand the team and its current capabilities. Playtest requests can be submitted and discussed via Discord in the new forum channel.

Reach out to {% rauserpic TimeCrush %} for more information.

## Cheat Investigation

We've started an official cheat team and created the dedicated account {% rauserpic RACheats %}.

If you suspect anyone may be cheating or see suspicious scores/times, you can send a DM to that account and the team will look into it.

## Official RA YouTube

## Site Updates
### RAWeb 2025.05.02
**Highlights for Players**
- We've rolled out a brand new Downloads page. Give it a try: https://retroachievements.org/downloads
- If you have any roles with access to team inboxes, you can now use a "Change Inbox" button in your DMs without needing to log in to your team account: https://retroachievements.org/messages
- We've made some small UX improvements to forums, including a slight performance improvement on submitting and editing posts.

**Highlights for Developers**
- We're rolling out a new feature today called Achievement Maintainers. When someone is a maintainer, they receive all tickets and dev stats for an achievement during their maintainership. More info can be found here: https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/pull/3452
- You won't get that weird error when you delete comments on a ticket anymore.

[Full release notes](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/releases/tag/2025.05.02)


### RAWeb 2025.05.15
This is a very small release that's almost all infrastructure-related for future features and site stability.

**Developer Highlights**
- Code Reviewers can now toggle the "In Review" status for claims.

[Full release notes](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/releases/tag/2025.05.15)

### RAWeb 2025.05.23
**Highlight for Players**
- We've started soft launching "Search 2.0". You can preview how fast it is by searching for users on your DM create page. Expect to see more about Search 2.0 in future site releases.
- We've made some adjustments to how game pages get stuff from the database. As a result, many game pages should load twice as fast, such as this one. Let us know if you feel a difference!
- For desktop users on the site forum, using the next and previous page buttons on forum topics should now feel nearly instantaneous. Give it a try here.
- For users on dark mode using the default palette, we've changed the text highlighting color so the text doesn't become invisible for some macOS and certain Linux users.

**Highlights for Developers**
- Games now support multiple titles and release dates. These currently have a temporary treatment on the game page, with a more permanent solution coming soon. Learn more here.
- The 'inactive devs' filter on the tickets list no longer includes achievements that have an active maintainer.

[Full release notes](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb/releases/tag/2025.05.23)

### RAWeb 2025.05.30
**Highlights for Players**
- If you're currently playing a game, we now put a quick link to it on the home page.
- The game page now remembers if you have the "Hide unlocked achievements" filter checked.

**Highlights for Developers**
- There's now a "Manage" button on achievement pages.
- Game release adds, edits, and deletes are now recorded in the game audit logs.
