This was awful. On my first "successful" attempt, I got struck and, although I didn't lose any health, I guess dropping the baby invalidated the achievement requirement.
Anyway! Here's how I got it done.
- Pick up baby (duh)
- Begin running and perform a high jump (hold A longer) over the guard.
- Do not release B (continue running).
- Do a MINI jump (tap A) over the disappearing floor. That way, you land on the same level as you jumped from. If you land on the elevated platform, the next part will be more difficult.
- High jump over the spider which should also allow you to clear the disappearing floor to the right of the spider.
- Again, you will be on the lowest level floor. Good.
- Now mini jump over the water gap. This part is crucial to make the run less difficult.
- Continue running, hit the spring, and land on the lowest level floor (again).
- Mini jump the disappearing floor.
- A guard stands on the edge facing right. You can run through that dope.
- Long jump the water gap, clearing the spider in the process.
- This part gets really FK'd up for me.
- Pass under the triangle structure. I would have suggested to long jump and clear the water gap but every time I tried, I'd hit an invisible wall and fall into the water.
- So... After passing under the triangle, you need to jump UP to the next level which has a disappearing floor.
- NOW you can stop running. Stabilize yourself atop the triangle structure. Entice the guard to move toward you. Then jump over that GOON when safe to do so. Run to the right and ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!
