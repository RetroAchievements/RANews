Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

Pokémon trainer mywifeleftm is ready to venture through the Kanto region with a team of his favourite Pokémon, consisting of Pikachu with a hat, a smug Jigglypuff and Blastoise, a creepy Butterfree, a Bulbasaur reduced to a flower, and a Trasheon. Covering a wide variety of types and origins, he's sure to make it far, even with the trash can!

The Avengers yet again had to switch up teammates due to a falling out, and who better to take such a place than the nemesis of the X-Men, Magneto? And... Tita Russell from Trails? Cervantes from Soulcalibur? That's an um, interesting team to say the least!

Many historians wonder what the origin of fire discovered by humans was. Did they make it themselves through rubbing logs, or maybe it was mother nature? Well, both are wrong actually, as it was just Dhalsim hanging around spitting fire!

Captain America has many enemies that he loves strangling, including the completely random one based on the beat 'em up that has no name or history. And in classic fashion, instead of saying an epic oneliner, he just yells his own name while committing murder. So cool.

To take a break from wild discoveries and murder, here we just have a chill photo of Mario and Pikachu posing for the camera. Honestly, very relieving to just see such a wholesome drawing!

Ah never mind, back to not being wholesome. It looks like Peach has gained a bit of fury as I don't think that axe is meant for cooking food... and she definitely looks kind of pissed too. I wonder what happened that caused her to be this angry?

If we think about happy couples in video games, Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man would probably be high up right? Happy family, no drama, what could go wrong? ...Oh, never mind, I see what's going on now. Welp, the search continues.

And finally for today, we have Donkey Kong dressed as Frank West from Dead Rising. Oddly fitting as I could totally see DK going through the mall murdering zombies en masse with weird over-the-top weapons! And hey, it looks pretty good on him too!
