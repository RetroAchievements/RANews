Great speedrun achievement that showcases the improvements that this hack brings. First things to note before detailing the route:

1. Turn on autorun in the settings,
2. In the core settings within the emulator, set the input device to a 6 button pad,
3. Assign the z and x buttons to the L and R buttons respectively,
4. Turn on zx strafing in the settings within the game,
5. Select a new game, and have the difficulty set to “I’m a wimp”,

It’s now easier to make the movements necessary to keep your speed making turns and dodging enemies.

# Route
- Go straight from where you start and strafe to the right to dodge the pole and then turn 45 degrees to the right and press the action button to open the door.
- Once the door is open, continue straight, but strafe to the right and then left again to go fast the raised box
- Slightly turn right and strafe left immediately to dodge the soldier. Continue straight to the door past the toxic pit room.
- This is the next part killed a lot of my attempts.
- Lineup with the left side of the door, open it, and continue straight while strafing to the right to dodge the imp.
- Open the exit door and try to stop close to the switch on the right so you can hit the button to end the level.
