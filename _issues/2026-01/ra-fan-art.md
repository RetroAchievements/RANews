Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

You know what would make bowling even better? If you said Elfs then I have questions, but if you said Grinch then I agree right there with ya. Looks like he's having a mighty fine time!

Looks like we are on a train ride... though I have no idea if it will be a good one or not. The driver doesn't know what he's doing, one person is... happy? Another is scared for his life, and then there's NiGHTs. Well it sure is an interesting ride!

Gather all around the Christmas tree, with favorites like Santa Claus Jr., Elf dude, Home Alone kid, and... Batman. Ah right, he did have a game in the Christmas event didn't he... Donald too for some reason.

NiGHTs is enjoying a clear sky during the Christmas season, dressing up in his seasonal costume to bring the kids presents. What better Santa than one that can fly freely after all?
