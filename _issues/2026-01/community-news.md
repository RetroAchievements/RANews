## Devember 2025

Devember 2025 has come to a close and it was the most successful year yet!  Developers and players worked together to close out a total of 2157 tickets, 1635 of these tickets were already open at the time Devember started. Additionally, we've nearly cleared all of the tickets from 2023 or earlier.

## Multiset Open Beta

Multiset is a feature that has been in development for over a year that allows you to earn subset achievements without requiring a patched ROM. Players can now experience and give feedback to the beta while additional changes are being made in the background.

More details and multiset enabled games can be found [here](https://retroachievements.org/forums/topic/33540?comment=348941#348941).

## RA Awards

The 5th annual RA Awards has started. The RA Awards are the community's opportunity to highlight their favorite sets, developers, contributors, and community members from the prior year. Check out the `# rawards-discussion` and `#rawards-voting` channels in Discord for more details.

## Hash Compatibility Testing

The QA-team is happy to announce a new process for hash compatibility testing! This allows users to help test hash compatibility for existing sets. You can work with the developer on testing new hashes while mastering the set to verify compatibility.

- Some game pages may now load significantly faster.
- We've added daily digest emails for forum notifications.
- For mobile users on the new game page, there's now a link to the comments section at the bottom of the achievement list.
- We've added support for four new locales that can be enabled from your settings page: Azerbaijani, Finnish, Indonesian, and Ukrainian. Thank you to the community members who contributed to the translations for these languages!
- We've made a few tweaks to prepare for the multiset beta that begins on Friday with one game on the Nintendo DS.
- Revision email notifications now remind players who've mastered a set that they've kept their badge.
- The redirect page has been migrated to our new UI framework.
- Event pages will now show when an underlying achievement has been demoted.

**Bug Fixes**
- Terraria players will no longer encounter a bug where they unlock 100% of achievements in a subset but don't get a badge.
- Game pages will no longer do a full page refresh when changing tabs on mobile.
- Game pages now show proper Discord embeds when linked to a list of unpublished achievements.
- All mobile drawers have been replaced with dialogs to better support iOS 26.

### RAWeb 2025.12.19
This release mostly includes changes for developers and management app users. We have some goodies included for players too.

**New Features**
- Game pages now support achievement grouping. Click here or here for a demo. Groups can currently be set up by members of DevC, QAM, and some members of the site cleanup team. Right now they're meant for game collections, but usage could expand later.
- Comments are now included in digest emails. If you still want live notifications, all you must do is explicitly subscribe to the comment wall.

**Bug Fixes**
- We've fixed an issue where the back button would stop working when navigating to a game page.
- Some profiles that would previously crash will now load properly again.
- Beaten playtimes will now recalculate if the requirements for the beaten award change.
- On mobile, game pages will now show the correct stats in the "Compare Progress" section for subsets.

**Management App Changes**
- The default pagination size for achievements has been expanded from 50 to 400.
- A new "Edit order values" button has been added for achievements that lets you manually edit their display orders.
- On achievement rows, in the action menu, new buttons have been added to help reordering: "Move to Top" and "Move to Bottom".
- These reordering improvements have also been brought over to leaderboards.
- Achievements now have an ID column you can enable or disable.
- Audit Logs for all resources are slightly cleaner, showing less redundant information.
- System names will now be shown for games when adding them to a hub.
- When adding games to hubs/similar games, the dialog size will no longer change based on which field you use.

## RAWeb 2025.12.29

**New Features**
- Our lightning-fast Search 2.0 feature now lets you search for forum posts and comments, fully replacing the old search system. You can access the dedicated search page by going here or clicking "Browse >" in the global search popup.
- Artists can now access the management app to upload badges and icons, as well as assign art credit accordingly.

**Bug Fixes**
- The "Hide completed games" toggle shows stuff again on user profiles that have hundreds of games played.
- Conversation summary emails won't show stray <br> tags anymore.
- We've fixed an issue where some sort orders on some game pages actually did nothing.
- On multiset-supported games, you can now always select what hash you used when opening a ticket.
- Some hub displays on game pages make more sense thanks to a contribution from @tomojin.

**Highlights for Developers**
- It's now possible to demote leaderboards thanks to a contribution from @drisc.
- If you have code notes for both a base game and "subset game" and access the "Memory" page (code notes list), there are new buttons available to help you merge your code notes to the right place.
- The achievement resource in the management app has had a glow-up. As a result, the devbox on the achievement details page has been thinned out, and in a future release will be removed altogether. More tools are on the way to manage achievements: here's a preview.
- Gigantic lists of achievements in the management app should now load significantly faster.
- Hubs now have sort titles just like games.

- Today, we also bid farewell to game1. At less than 150 total views over the last 7 days, it felt like the right time to say goodbye and reduce our maintenance overhead.

## Emulator Updates
### RANes 1.2
- Supports future split of FDS into a separate console
- Includes two years of upstream changes
- Downloading the integration DLL now shows a progress dialog

**RetroAchievements is now available for Dolphin Emulator on Android.**

- RetroAchievements is now supported in Dolphin for Android's development builds and is ready for the community to use.

- You can now earn achievements for GameCube games on your Android devices, with Wii/WiiWare on the way & landing early next year!

**Important Details**
- This feature is currently available in development builds only (version 2509-503 and later).
- Consider this an open beta. We've tested it internally, but with hundreds of players now available to stress test it, there will likely be issues we haven't discovered.
- The achievement list for the game you're playing isn't visible yet. That's still WIP and will be added in an upcoming emulator update.
- A stable release of Dolphin for Android with RetroAchievements support is planned soon.

**How to Get Started**
You can access development builds in two ways:
- Download the latest 2509-503 Android development build directly from this URL, OR
- Opt into the Dolphin Emulator beta/open testing program on the Google Play Store. It may take a few hours from this post for the new build to be available over there.

- If you experience any issues, please report them to ⁠tech-support . Your testing and feedback will help us ensure a smooth experience for everyone when this feature lands in an upcoming stable release.
