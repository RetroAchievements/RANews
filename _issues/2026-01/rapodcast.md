# Episode 29 - You, Me, He She We, Italk!

With RA getting exciting new features both on the backend functionality wise, and for the player in the form of Multi-set entering an open beta, our player base continues to grow each passing day. Combining that with the projected Wii rollout coming this March, we won't lack for a constant and steady influx of fresh faces.

Everybody who joins has their own history outside these coded walls - other experiences, passions, and strengths. Some may hold multiple PHD's, some could be their cities biggest philanthropist, some may hold a place on television stardom; and we'd have no idea unless we asked. Well, tonight we ask.

For exactly that reason, I have my guest here tonight, {% rauser ITalk %}, current partner on multiple platforms who at the time of recording holds a YouTube subscriber count of 1.16 million.
