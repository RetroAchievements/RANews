## Ai to Yuujou no Neko Monogatari: Jingle Cats: Love Para Daisakusen no Maki (PlayStation)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Console     | Genre                                                               |

Jingle Cats is perhaps the most bizarre video game based on a musical artist. The game features a cast of cats that are allegedly from the Jingle Cats novelty CD which features cats single classic songs. At the start of the level, you select two cats with the goal of getting them to fall in love with each other. The game is presented as a point and click adventure. You must manage your cats’ stats and allow them to play with each other to build a relationship. Once you succeed at filling their heart bar, the cats will reward you with a rendition of one of the songs from the CD. The artwork feels like something made in MS Paint, which has a unique sort of charm to it. The game features a number of different cats and lots of things in the house for the cats to play with, which could lend itself to different achievements. As you may expect, this game was only released in Japan, however a translation for the game was recently released, making it the perfect time for this game to get a set.

Better known in the West as Venus Wars, it's a Famicom game based on the hit 1989 movie. Some of us are old enough to remember watching it on the Sci-fi Channel in the 90s, or even renting it from Blockbuster Video. Characterization may have been hit-or-miss, but the action sequences were absolute masterclass, and the Famicom game brings that energy with it.

It plays as a grid-based strategy game with 10 units under your control: 8 monobikes and 2 carriers which restore fuel and missiles to adjacent bikes at the beginning of each turn. When a monobike engages an enemy, it turns into a third-person shooter mode for 60 seconds or until the enemy is destroyed (or you are). Once you start encountering the infamous "Octo" tanks from the movie, a third overhead one-on-one battle mode begins. This one plays until one of you is defeated, and it's not uncommon to lose a bike in these match-ups. Fortunately, everybody is repaired at the start of the next mission.

Very simple, and very playable. A translation patch exists that's notably lousy, but it makes all the menus and character stats accessible to non-Japanese readers. This game absolutely deserves a set.

## Shin Seiki Evangelion: Battle Orchestra Portable (PlayStation Portable)

In celebration of [RA-TALITY](https://retroachievements.org/event/190-ra-tality), I wanted to highlight a strange fighter that never left Japan. On the PS2 there was an explosion of games for the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. Visual novel dating sims, action games covering the entirety of the show and movie’s stories, a [Princess Maker](https://retroachievements.org/hub/25604)-esque life management sim of one of the girls in the show, an [Ace Attorney](https://retroachievements.org/hub/1056)-styled mystery adventure, and even a typing game. So, it’s no surprise that a platform fighter was made to capitalize on the popularity of the anime.

The game's story mode has five stories focusing on each of the pilots (Shinji, Rei, Asuka, Toji, Kensuke, and Kaworu) where they follow their perspective during the game’s events and battles where you battle angels while piloting the mechs known as Evas. Where this game sets apart from the other Eva games is that you can play as all the angels in multiplayer with their own unique move sets, along with a cameo appearance with Gunbuster being a playable fighter. The PSP expanded version adds an exclusive mission mode that allows you to recreate any fight from the series.

## Cid to Chocobo no Fushigi na Dungeon: Toki Wasure no Meikyuu DS+ (Nintendo DS)

This DS iteration of the [Chocobo's Dungeon](https://retroachievements.org/hub/20772) series is pretty seldom discussed, and I only found out about it while looking through the list of games with translation patches. I wish I had known about it sooner and that we had gotten it outside of Japan, because I loved the Wii version of Chocobo's Dungeon as a kid and would have much appreciated a portable version. Cid to Chocobo no Fushigi na Dungeon: Toki Wasure no Meikyuu DS+ is basically an adaptation of [Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon](https://retroachievements.org/game/235) onto the DS format, with the same core story content and dungeon-crawling gameplay loop; it rebalances some job abilities, adds some new ones, and has a new mode where you play as Cid, Chocobo's adventuring partner. Cid doesn't change jobs, but instead gathers materials that can be used to upgrade or add properties to his gear.

DS+ has a translation patch, though it only covers the menus and other gameplay-relevant text, with the plot left unfinished. Chocobo's Dungeon Wii is currently under development at the time of this writing; it would be quite neat if I could see this overlooked little adaptation-slash-revision come out as a companion to its better-known older sibling.

While this game isn't listed on [dungeoncrawlers](https://www.dungeoncrawlers.org/), it's still one of the pioneers of the genre. It’s the first attempt to make a game similar to [Wizardy](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7990) by Japanese developers, as well as being (I believe) the first home console game to allow save transfer between it and the 2nd game of the series.. The historical value of this game I don't think can be underrated.

The game features 8 levels of a dungeon of similar size to Wizardy, and while the gameplay is basic, I would still like the series to have sets because dungeon crawlers are my favorite genre of games. You only control one character in this game unlike later in the series, however, sometimes simplicity is good. Your goal is to get to the bottom of the dungeon to do battle with the Demon King, as all adventurers are wont to do. The series became more polished as they were released, but it was still such a great seller that 1 and 2 were re-released on MSX.

The game was released in Japan December 19, 1986, and a fan translation has existed since 2006. Fan translations of the entire series also exist.

What would be more fitting for [Kamen Rider](https://retroachievements.org/hub/5686) than a board game? You have the choice of all Showa riders, from the OG Rider to Black RX, all spread into multiple teams, ready to spin the wheel and move across the board to stop Grand Shocker from his ambitions. The game has some interesting aspects to it, not that similar to [Mario Party](https://retroachievements.org/hub/13353). Your rider teams can level up, and you have multiple regions in Japan to deploy to, traveling around the regional board and fulfilling missions while stopping Grand Shocker's elite troops. NPCs around the board tell you to do tasks for them, similar to [Mario Party Advance](https://retroachievements.org/game/5093), and each finished one gets you a step closer to removing Grand Shocker's influence from the relevant region. Combat encounters are done on your bike, being turn-based, and are all about reaching the finish line before the enemy troops. If you have any knowledge of that era of Kamen Rider, you will see some familiar faces, too. The presentation is fairly standard, the music is fine, and the graphics are what you would expect from a Famicom game. It is worth checking out for any Rider fan just for novelty's sake, seeing what type of game they would make by turning it into a board game.

## Magical Taruruuto-kun 2 (Game Boy)

After having a blast with [Magical Taruruuto-kun](https://retroachievements.org/game/12898) on the Game Gear, I wanted to see what other entries in this oddball manga series existed that did not have a set on RetroAchievements. Lo and behold, I found this little gem on the Game Boy, a system which I have grown quite a fondness of over these last several months. And it's quite a fascinating little title that does not have a lot of information about it anywhere when I looked it up, which made it that much more interesting to dive into.

Despite not understanding Japanese during the gameplay video I watched, the premise appears to be that Raibar, in yet another attempt to one-up Taruruuto, somehow managed to jumble up the entire world, and now the young wizard must travel around to set things right. The gameplay follows a rather fascinating mix of formulas. The overworld, due to being mixed up, manages to follow a formula similar to Pipe Mania, where you can only travel along any roads connected to each other on this vast grid. From here, you either interact with various characters to progress the game's story, or travel to areas which change the gameplay to a standard 2D platformer. Here, you collect takoyaki buns and stun and defeat enemies by...licking them (90's shonen anime stuff, don't worry) and attempt to make it to the end of the stage. And make sure you collect that takoyaki, because once you get back to the overworld, you can shift the panels of the map using them as a currency to allow you to access new areas and overall progress.

It's a really fascinating game that doesn't really need a lot of Japanese knowledge to progress through, and considering the longplay I watched lasted just under 40 minutes, it's not that long of a game either. I dunno, this game just seems really cute and charming, and I think everyone would be pleasantly surprised if this thing had a set.

Puella Magi: Madoka Magica was my favorite anime for a very long while, and is still in my top 3 to this day. Seeing as the only official games we got recently was two free-to-play gacha games, one of which got shut down in North America after about a single year of uptime, I would love to see this one get a set.

It also has a fan translation, though it is missing the Homura Chapter at the time this is written. I wouldn't mind the set being for the almost complete fan translation, or only for the untranslated game (hopefully the memory isn't changed, or minimally enough that it wouldn't be too much of an effort to support both).

If you are not a fan of the series, the gameplay is very similar to a [Persona](https://retroachievements.org/hub/2763) game, where you need to allot time into where you go during the day, but with a dungeon crawling aspect mixing the [Mystery Dungeon](https://retroachievements.org/hub/2956) gameplay with the [Etrian Odyssey](https://retroachievements.org/hub/18720) 3D point of view. If this strikes your fancy, you should still have a blast going through this game, as it does not require any knowledge of the original media. Madoka's route, which you have to do first, actually follows the first eight episodes of the anime quite faithfully, until it doesn't, which leads to the next routes, which are considered offshoot timeline not seen in the anime, and also deepens the story by exploring the past and psyche of many other characters.

Tales of Rebirth is one of many [Tales of](https://retroachievements.org/hub/8942) games that came to PS2, but among the few that never got a western release. Now that it has a fan translation, there is a wonderful opportunity for fans to experience it with a translation and achievements! Tales of, for those not familiar, is a very unique action RPG series where you have a party - one is controlled by the player, the rest are controlled by AI, usually with plenty of room to customize how your party will behave. Party members also can be controlled by friends playing with you, which makes for an especially fun way to experience the game. From what I personally played of it in Japanese, it was a fun game.

Tales of is also known for good stories and good character and world building, and Tales of Rebirth doesn't fall short here. They are games that are chock full of content, and the battle system has a nice amount of depth to it that would give a creative developer plenty of room for fun achievement ideas. This game uses 2D sprite art, so it also would be easier to make nice badges for. The games usually have nice memory to work with as well, they just are very chock full of content.

I know I would be very happy to see a set for Tales of Rebirth. It and [Destiny Director's Cut](https://retroachievements.org/game/19139) were the ones I was the most curious to play that never got western releases. It's lauded as one of the best in the series both for story and gameplay, and there is much room for a creative dev to have a blast making a set for it.

DoDonPachi DaiFukkatsu is a beloved entry in the [CAVE](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7610) shmup library. It retains aesthetics and characters from the hugely popular but brutally hard [DoDonPachi DaiOuJou](https://retroachievements.org/game/14883), while being a lot more accessible and showing the development that CAVE have gone through as developers since.

While [DoDonPachi DaiFukkatsu Black Label](https://retroachievements.org/game/22131) already has achievements, it's mechanically so distinct that it can be considered as a totally different game in itself. Black Label is more of a remix of the original game, so the scoring system and some mechanics are different. The RED Gauge system, for example, acting as a player-customizable rank, where playing well makes the game harder is not present in regular DaiFukkatsu. It also has a different soundtrack and lacks the second loop.

All this is to say that the difference between the two games could be dismissed as something akin to a fighting game update, which can be marginal changes at best, but there's a lot of depth to it here, and I think it's beneficial to have the chance to experience both.
