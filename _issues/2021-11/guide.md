## 1) Synopsis

**Set Difficulty**: 5/10  
**Approximate Time to Master**: 60 hours or more.   
**Minimum Number of Playthroughs Needed**: Up to 5  
**Number of Missable Achievements**: 32  
**Does Difficulty Affect Achievements?**: N/A  

## 2) Introduction

Harvest Moon 64 can be argued to be one of the best Harvest Moon games out there. The primary goal is to raise a farm and do well enough by Year 3 to be allowed to continue. In the game you will grow crops, raise farm animals, get married, have kids, and compete in festivals (along with various other side quests in the game).

Due to this game having so many mechanics for dating and such, I will be including some information at the end of this guide for each of the marriage candidates and other information.

## 3) Walkthrough

**Step 1**

The first step is to play the game. There is a lot to this game, as it is a game to be played over a long period of time. You should be able to get the following achievements through normal playthrough. If you miss them before your evaluation, you should be able to get them afterwards. They are as follows:

[A Father and Son’s Reunion]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125572) **-=Missable=-**  

**Step 2**
This step covers basically everything that can be missed, or that you can choose not to do. Typically, if you miss these in your first playthrough, you can start over and aim strictly for them. However, since there is so much missible content, you only have a single chance to get them, and you have to make choices, I recommend using another save file. 

For the girls, get their affection up all around the same time, same with the rivals. That way you can trigger their marriages, then reset and reload your game and go for the next one. I am saying step two is your marriages because there are a lot of achievements that are affected by your marriage and who you marry. This method will cut down greatly on the time needed and the number of playthroughs. If you don’t do this method, expect at least 5 playthroughs. 

So as for the “cleanup,” the achievements are as follows:

## 4) Achievements

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138306.png) [Town Introduction]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99513)  
_Have the Mayor show you around town and introduce you to the villagers._  
**-=Missable=-**

This one is rather simple and just takes time. When you first start and leave your house, the mayor will be standing there, and you will talk to him. He offers to show you around town, accept and watch it play out. It will use up a few in game hours but it's not a big deal. You will be awarded the achievement when the event is over.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138305.png) [Binge Watcher]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99514)  
_Turn on the TV and watch all the channels._  

Quick and easy, in your house is a TV. The most useful thing for me is the weather, but there are multiple channels. Essentially turn it on and flip through them and you’ll be awarded the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138304.png) [Slacker!]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99515)  
_Take a nap during the day._  

Very easy, if you just stand there and waste away your time not moving, you will eventually lay down and start taking a nap. So just waste your precious minutes of the quick day, drop the controller and let yourself fall asleep. If you really want that time back, just save before and reload so you are not wasting the little time in each day.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138302.png) [Seasoned Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99517)  
_Accumulate 10,000 Gold._

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138301.png) [Veteran Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99518)  
_Accumulate 50,000 Gold._

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138300.png) [Master Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99519)  
_Accumulate 100,000 Gold._  

Money is something you will earn throughout the game as you ship crops and animal goods. Just save your money, plant as much as possible, and get farm animals when you can. The more you ship, the more cash you get, and eventually you will earn the money achievements as you go.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138324.png) [Giddy Up!]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99529)   
_Get and name your horse._  

This can be gotten as soon as your first day. You will need to trigger the cutscene anyway if you wanted to get farm animals. All you need to do is head to Green Ranch. Leave your farm and go south, and once you get there, it will trigger the scene. Get it, name it, and you’ll get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138327.png) [The Bird is the Word]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99526)  
_Get and name your first chicken._  

This one is simple enough. Head to Green Ranch and enter the far-right building. You will have the option to buy livestock. Buy one, name it and you’ll get your achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138295.png) [Poultry Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99449)  
_Acquire 6 Chickens._  

Just as you did with the first chicken, you can buy all your chickens at Green Ranch until you have a coop with 6 chickens. Alternatively, if you want to save money, you can put them in the nesting spot in your coop and they will hatch into baby chicks over time. If you are buying, you can only get one chicken per day.  Also note, do not leave your chickens outside in the winter or rain, and if you do not feed them, they can become sick and eventually die. 

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138326.png) [Lively Livestock]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99527)  
_Get and name your first barn animal._

Just like with the chickens, you can buy sheep or cows from Green Ranch. They are more expensive, but their byproducts are worth more. Go to the ranch and buy either a sheep or a cow, name it, and you’ll get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138323.png) [Livestock Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99530)  
_Have a full barn of livestock._

Like before, you can head to Green Ranch and buy all your livestock, either cows or sheep, or a mixture of them will work. You need 8 animals to fill the Barn. I find it easier to buy them, as raising them from birth can take a very long time and close to two months before the calf is born and grown to be able to produce products. Also, like with the chickens, do not leave them out in the rain, or in winter, and always feed them. Also note that you must buy any sheep you want, as only cows can be impregnated. [not essential, but less confusing and improved flow]


=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138325.png) [My Animal Family]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99528)  
_Fill your Chicken Coop and Barn with animals._

Get 6 chickens and 8 barn animals either through buying or from eggs/impregnating. This will pop once you have the maximum number of animals you can get.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138318.png) [Cabbage Patch]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125547)  
_Ship a total of 100 cabbages._

Cabbages are a Spring crop that takes 9 days to grow and the seeds cost 200G. They take the longest in the season to grow, but once you ship 100, the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138317.png) [Mr. Potato Head]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125548)  
_Ship a total of 100 Potatoes._

Potatoes are a Spring crop that take 6 days to grow and cost 200G to buy the seeds. Plant them in Spring and after you ship 100 of them, the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138316.png) [These “Turnip” Everywhere]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125549)  
_Ship a total of 100 Turnips._

Turnips are a Spring crop that takes 4 days to grow and the seeds cost 200G.  These are the fastest to grow and you can plant a lot in the season. Once you ship 100 of them the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138315.png) [Corn Maize]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125550)  
_Ship a total of 100 corn._

Corn is a Summer crop that will take 13 days to grow and costs 300G for the seeds. The nice thing about corn is that it will regrow after 4 days. So while it takes a long time to grow, you will get a continuous crop of it until the end of the season. Ship 100 and you will get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138314.png) [Not for Throwing]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125551)  
_Ship a total of 100 Tomatoes._

Tomatoes are a Summer crop, they take 9 days to grow and cost 300G. Like corn, they will also regrow and will do so every 3 days until the end of the season. Grow and ship 100 of them and you will get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138313.png) [Egg Head]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125552)  
_Ship a total of 100 Eggplants._  

Eggplant is a Fall crop and is really the only Fall crop there is. It takes 7 days to grow and costs 300G for the seeds. Like corn and tomatoes, it will regrow and will do so after 3 days. Ship 100 of these and the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138312.png) [Very Berry]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125553)  
_Ship a total of 100 Strawberries._  

You can buy Strawberry seeds in Winter. However, to grow them, you will need a greenhouse, as they will only grow there. The seeds cost 500G to buy and grow after 5 days. They will not regrow. Once you grow and ship 100 of them, the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138311.png) [Shipped for Breakfast]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125554)  
_Ship a total of 100 Eggs._  

For this, you will need chickens. The more chickens you have, the more eggs you will get. You will get one egg per chicken each day. Keep in mind that not feeding them, or leaving them out in the winter or rain can make them sick and they will not produce any eggs. Once you get 100 and ship them, you will get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138310.png) [Got Milk?]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125555)  
_Ship a total of 100 Milk._  

For Milk, you will need cows. Only cows can be milked, so don’t bother trying to milk your sheep (or other animals). You can get 1 milk per day per cow, so the more cows you get, the faster you will get this. Ship 100 milk over the course of your game and you will be awarded this achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138328.png) [Tools of the Trade]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99525)  
_Fully upgrade all your field tools._  

All of your tools will upgrade over time as you use them. Essentially each tool will gain a level when you hit a certain number of times using them. Each tool has a different number of times it has to be used for it to upgrade, the number of times are as follows:

**Hoe:** 300 uses to silver, another 300 to gold.  
**Hammer:** 100 uses to silver, another 100 to gold.  
**Axe:** 450 uses to silver, another 450 to gold.  
**Watering Can:** 600 uses to silver, another 600 to gold.  
**Sickle:** 350 to silver, another 350 to gold.  

It is possible to get your tools to gold at the start of the game in a single night. If you head to the bar, time will freeze and you can just keep using your tools in the bar and they will get used towards their level up. Once you run out of stamina, you can order water and then keep going. This is tedious and time consuming but can be done. Personally, I would just let them level up naturally as you play but if you want them right from the start, you can do this.

_Have your child and get your picture._   
**-=Missable=-**   

To have a child, you need to get married and maintain your high affection with your wife for at least a month. So keep giving her gifts every day to keep her happy (Pretty sad… you gotta buy her happiness). Over time, you can tell she is pregnant as she will change what she talks about and eventually she will tell you she is pregnant. During the pregnancy, you want to keep her happy, otherwise the pregnancy will last longer. After the pregnancy happens and your child is born, you will get the picture in your album and this achievement will trigger.

**Note:** While typically everyone gets married when they play this game, it is possible to not get married at all and have all your rivals get married, taking all the girls and making this achievement impossible to get!

_Acquire a Power Nut._   

See [Nuts of Power]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125585)  

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138290.png) [Nuts of Power]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125585)  
_Get all the Power Nuts._   

Power Nuts, also called a Power Berry, in this game are what will increase your stamina. There are 10 in total, and they can be found in various locations and through various methods. The methods are as follows:

**First Power Nut:** You will naturally get one just from working in your field with the hoe. It is random when it happens so there is no actual looking for it. It can even be on tilled soil, though unless you are just grinding for it, it is better to just let it come naturally and only grind if it is the last one you are trying to get.

**Second Power Nut:** Fishing can get you a few. One is from simply fishing, as one will eventually be caught.

**Third Power Nut:** If you catch a large fish, go to the pond in the forest by the tent. If you throw the large fish in, an Imp will appear and give you a Power Nut.

**Fourth Power Nut:** If you catch a small fish, you can go to the pond in the mountains by the tent and the Imp will give you another one. This one is blue and you will use less stamina in rainy weather after eating it.

**Fifth Power Nut:** When you go to the mines and reach level 4, you can dig and find a Power Nut.

**Sixth Power Nut:** Win the Egg Festival and your prize will be a Power Nut

**Seventh Power Nut:** During the Flower Festival, there is a travelling merchant dressed in black. You can buy one from him for 1000G

**Eighth Power Nut:** If you go to the Harvest Goddess and offer a vegetable to her in the morning, she will ask you a question. Answer with Strength and she will give you a Power Nut.

**Ninth Power Nut:** In Winter, when the fisherman’s pond is frozen, there is a rock. Go and hit it with your golden hammer as hard as you can.

**Tenth Power Nut:** You will need to plant flowers in your fields. You will need at least 8 (I just planted one patch). Eventually a boy named Stu will ask for one but have no money. He will offer you marbles, so take them. Afterwards, if you have not already, go make friends with the harvest sprites. When you get their friendship up enough, the one at the table will offer to trade a Power Nut for the marbles.

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138284.png) [Horse Track Gambling]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125557)  
_Bet on one horse at the races and have it win (cannot enter your own horse)._   

The Horse Race is on Spring 17 and Fall 28 (there are two horse races a year). There are 3 races in the day and I recommend getting there earlier than later because if you get there later, you may only get to do 1 or 2 of the races. Simply talk to the people at the desk and you will be able to bet on horses. Now, you can only bet on one, otherwise the achievement will not work. So bet on the horse that you think will win and watch the race. If your horse wins, you will get the achievement. If you don’t get it, you can always reload the day or wait until the next race. Also note that you cannot have your own horse in the race, there is a separate achievement for that.

_Bet on one dog at the races and have it win (cannot enter your own dog)._   

The Dog race is on Winter 19 and there is only one per year. Like the horse races, you bet on a dog, you watch it and if you win, you get the achievement. There are also 3 races throughout the day, so it is recommended to be there early.

_Fully expand your house as well as have your Baby Bed, Cabinet and cloth your table._   

The Head Carpenter can be found in the mountains. You can speak with him, and he can give you extensions to your house for the cost of lumber and gold. You get the lumber from breaking tree stumps. For all the upgrades, you are going to need over 2,000 lumber and will cost you close to 50,000G.  Just talk to him and choose the upgrades you want and eventually you will have all your upgrades. 
Not only do you need these upgrades, but you also need the tablecloth and the rug in your house. To get the tablecloth, you will need to go to the Flower Bud Bakery and enter a raffle at the end of Winter. When you buy a cake there, you will be awarded a point and the raffle costs 10 points to enter. So buy your cakes! You can also get the carpet (or rug) from Rick’s for 3,000GP.

_Make an offering to the Goddess._   

To find the Harvest Goddess, you must go to the mountains. There is a clearing east of the carpenters with a little pond and a bridge in front of it. Bring a vegetable or an egg to the pond and throw it in. She should appear. The items must also be from your farm. Bought items or foraged items will not work.

**-=Missable=-**  

On Spring 18 of your first year, Cliff will be at your door with his bird, and he will be very hungry and ask for food. If you have some food, feed him, if you don’t HE DIES! (Just kidding). Feed him some berries or something and you will gain more affection from him and get the achievement. If you don’t, it will be lost forever until you start over again.

This one is simple, you cannot miss this unless you stop playing… but of course you are going for the achievements so of course you will play this past your first year. Do so and get to Year 2 and you will get this achievement.

_Have your farm evaluated in Year 3 and be allowed to continue._  
**-=Missable=-**  

This is very hard not to do and you would have to pretty much not do anything all, no animals, no wife, if you don’t talk to people, don’t sell crops or make any money, then you will get the bad ending. This, however, can basically lock you out from continuing and if your most recent save is today, well… I hope you have earlier ones or you are starting over. If you want to make sure you get past this, make sure you at least are married or have some animals.

_Max your dog's affection._  

This will be done over time. The max affection for your dog is 255 and it starts with 0. Increase its affection by picking it up, whistling for it and feeding it. Just do these things and it will be maxed at some point through your game. Keep in mind that if you hit your dog, you are a bad person and you will lose affection.

_Max your horse's affection._  

Just like the dog, this will be done over time so long as you interact with your horse. You can gain affection with your horse by talking to it, riding it and brushing it. Also, if you hit the horse, you will lose affection.

_Dig up the Music Box._  

The Music Box is dug up in your field but can be hard to find if you don’t know where to look. First, you will need to go to the tree on your farm and interact with it using A. You’ll find a treasure map. It will lead you to the right side of the field from your dog house, another way being if you go to the tree on your farm and go down. Really it is about the spot where the two intercept. From there, you need to dig with your hoe at least 10 times and you will dig it up. Refer to the pictures in the Screenshots section below.

_Find the weathervane in the mines._  

In Winter, you can go to the mines and to find the weathervane, you need to get down to the 4th floor and dig. I recommend bringing something to eat or refill your stamina as the way to the next floor is not always the same and is random, same with finding the weathervane.

**-=Missable=-**  

There are a few things that need to happen for this. First, you will need to get Ann’s affection up. Then in Winter on a day where it is snowing, so long as you are not married and Ann’s affection is at least 200, she will arrive at your house and ask you to follow her, you will see an event with the Pika Bunny. This will award you the picture, giving you the achievement.

**-=Missable=-**  

There are a few things that need to happen for this. First, you will need to get Maria’s affection up for this. In Summer, as long as it is not raining, you are not married and her affection is up 200 or more, she come by your farm at 6:00pm and she will be there and ask you to follow her. Do so and you will see an event, which will unlock this photo and give you your achievement.

_Get the photo with Karen of the Fairies blessing the Vineyard._  
**-=Missable=-**  

This one involves a bit more than the others because not only do you need Karen’s affection higher, you need to have saved the vineyard as well. So, if the vineyard is saved (see The Importance of Viticulture), you are not married and it is Fall 7, she will show up to your hours at 9:00pm. Talk to her and you will go to her photo event and get this achievement.

**-=Missable=-**  

Similar to the other girls. You will need to get your affection up to at least 200 with Elli first. Once you have that and you are not married, on Fall 9, Elli will show up on your farm at 6:00pm. Talk to her and she will take you on her photo event and you will be awarded this achievement.

**-=Missable=-**  

This one is a little different as affection does not seem to be important here. On the Spring of your second year, the shop will carry blue mist seeds. When you buy them, You and Popuri will plant them near the goddess pond. You need to water these every day and after about a week or so, they will bloom. This will trigger the photo event with Popuri.

_Get married to Karen._  
**-=Missable=-**  

To get married to the girls, you need to have their affection up to a Pink Heart (208 affection), at Rick’s shop, you will see a blue feather appear for 980G. Buy the feather and give it to the girl you wish to marry and they should say yes. Now, this being said, not all the girls are the same as Karen. With Karen you also will have needed to save the Vineyard (see The Importance of Viticulture). So to marry Karen, save the vineyard, get the affection up to pink heart and then give her the Blue Feather. This will trigger the marrying process and lead you to your achievement.

**-=Missable=-**   

This involves befriending Cliff while keeping Ann’s affection lower. If Ann’s affection gets too high, you will not be able to trigger the wedding between these two. So work primarily on Cliff. The easiest way I found to get Cliff’s affection up is to give him eggs. If you are raising chickens, then you should get these daily. After his affection gets to a certain point, he will meet you outside and invite you to his wedding.

Gray is a quiet guy, doesn’t talk much and he is kind of shy, even when he invites you to his wedding though he’ll drop hints and such when he is close in the bar. However, all you need to do is get his affection up. Like Cliff, he also likes eggs, which are easy enough to come by. If for some reason you don’t have them, he also likes you showing him his dog. Once his affection is up enough, he will show up on your farm and invite you to the wedding.

The best way to get his affection up is to give him flowers and milk. I used milk myself because it was easier to get since I had cows.

This one involves a little more because you will need to save the vineyard first (see The Importance of Viticulture) while getting Kai’s affection up. If you do not save the Vineyard, Karen will leave (making this impossible), so make sure you save the Vineyard. The best way I found to get Kai’s affection up is to give him berries. He seems to love them. Once his affection is high enough and the Vineyard is saved, Kai will show up to your farm and invite you to the wedding.

All you need to do is enter it and win the race, you’ll get a picture, and the achievement will unlock. However, if you don’t train your dog, then he will not do well.

Essentially, brushing it, whistling to it and riding it a little each day will train it to perform better in the race. The horse also needs to be fully grown, meaning this achievement cannot be done on the first race in the game. But, enter your horse after it is fully grown and trained, watch it win and you will be awarded the picture and the achievement.

This achievement actually requires two stages. First is actually becoming the Harvest King, which is done in the Harvest Festival on Fall 12. The second is to attend the Sowing Festival in Spring 8. The challenge comes more from getting chosen as Harvest King. To do so, at the Harvest Festival, Elli has cakes, and towards the end, you need to eat one of them. You need to get the one with the coin. If you get the coin, you will be awarded the title for the next year and will get to spread the seeds on the Sowing Festival on the 8th of Spring.

This festival takes place on the 4th of Fall. To win the cow festival, it is about how much milk you have shipped and how high the affection is for your cow. The milk can come from any cow, but the cow’s affection must be at least 240. So when you have met these conditions, enter your cow and you will win the festival, getting the picture and the achievement.

The race is essentially pressing the A button. I had a fair amount of difficulty, as mashing it doesn't seem to consistently work. You need to press the button rapidly as well as within the timing. I found it best to keep the mashing as a consistent speed while trying to keep it rapid. Make sure you save the day before, otherwise you will need to wait an entire year.

_Win the Egg Festival._    

The Egg Festival is on Fall 20 and while some may assume that this is a festival where you bring eggs, this isn’t the case. It feels more like an Easter festival as you need to hunt for hidden eggs. Go to the town square and talk to everyone and the mayor will start the event. In this event, the mayor will show a colored egg and you need to go to locations where these boxes are and check to see if there is an egg. If you pick one that is not the right color, remember that color as it may appear later. But match the colors and the person who gets the most is the winner.

**-=To the left of the Church=-**

I highly recommend saving before you do this, as if you get unlucky and the egg is in, say,  the last chest you look, then you will most likely lose.

So saving the Vineyard is actually a pretty important thing to do. Follow these steps and you should save the Vineyard, keep in mind this is a long process:
1.	The first step is to go to the Vineyard, watch the initial cutscene of Kai and Karen fighting.

2.	Your next step is to befriend Duke. Duke is the Bartender and his favorite gift is Wild Grapes... however, those are not available until Fall. So you can essentially just give him other gifts and talk to him. Even just talking to him will increase his affection high enough and he’ll give you a wine called “The Door of Heaven,” a wine that your grandfather wanted to give you.

3.	The next step is to befriend the Harvest Sprites. Now, I kind of recommend doing this at the same time as the previous step if you can. They take a little more affection than Duke does, which is why just talking to Duke should be enough. Now, the Harvest Sprites are located in the cave under Moon Mountain. When you start talking to them, they will not be able to be understood. Just talk to them, give them gifts, anything really works, I usually used foraged goods. Eventually he will begin speaking in English. Keep befriending them and talking to them. Once you see them mention something about wine, speak to them again and they will tell you about the Harvest Goddess and to go and talk to her.

4.	In this step, you need to have a crop or animal product saved, I used an egg. With this crop or product, head to the Harvest Goddess’ Pond and throw it in. She will appear and where she normally gives you three choices, you will see the option that says “Grape Spirit.” Choose that option and you will see a cutscene where the Harvest Goddess prays to the dead looking tree in the Vineyard.

5.	This step really involves you doing nothing except for going to bed on the night of Fall 6. When you go to bed that night, the Harvest Goddess will appear to you in a dream and tell you that the Vineyard has been restored and that the Keif Fairies have come.

6.	You should already have the achievement by now, however, if you have your affection up with Karen (At least 120), she will come to your farm the next day and ask you to come. With the Vineyard restored and the Keif Fairies back, you will see a little cutscene and you will get her picture.

_Getting to Moon Mountain Restaurant before bridge is built._   
**-=Missable=-**   

This is easy, there is a tree at the base of the cliff in Moon Mountain. Go around back and press A and you will climb the tree and get up to the ledge. Enter the restaurant and it will unlock the achievement. Keep in mind that the bridge starts being built on Fall 22, so be sure to do this before then.

_Help the Lumberjacks build the bridge (must help every day of the project and must be done in a single session)._   
**-=Missable=-**   

On Fall 22, a carpenter will visit your home and ask you for help to build a bridge. You have until 3:00 to show up and it will always advance the day to 3:00 and you will get paid for each day. The days to help go from Fall 23 to Fall 27. As long as you help each day, you will unlock this achievement. If you miss a day you will be locked out from earning this, so don’t forget. Not only that but this MUST be done in a single session, so do not save and quit.

_Out-drink everyone at the New Year's Day Party and send them home. (Everyone must be present)_   
**-=Missable=-**   

At the New Year’s Party, there are several villagers there and every time you talk to them, you’ll take a drink. Each drink with reduce your tolerance. In order to out drink them all, you will need your tolerance up… a lot, at least 28 in alcohol tolerance. When you first start, you might be able to do one or two drinks before you pass out so you will need to get your tolerance up. The way you do it is pretty much buy and drink alcohol, usually from the bar. There is a better way however, buy a glass bottle from Rick at the flower festival, with this you can get wine for free at the vineyard in the shed. You can fill up the bottle and drink it and with you being inside the shed, time does not move making it so you can max your tolerance pretty much in a day.

Note: Everyone must be present so if either anyone is gone forever, for example Karen, then you will be locked from getting this achievement.

_Max out your alcohol tolerance._   

This one is actually pretty easy, though grindy. You can do this two ways, buy and drink alcohol, usually from the bar and build it up over time. Or buy a glass bottle from Rick at the flower festival, with this you can get wine for free at the vineyard in the shed. You can fill up the bottle and drink it and with you being inside the shed, time does not move making it so you can max your tolerance pretty much in a day.

_Get to the 5th level of the mines._   

This one can be a bit tricky and a bit luck dependent. The mines open in during Winter. TO get this achievement, you need to dig in the mines and get to the 5th floor. Of course, the stairs down is random so it may take a few tries. It is also recommended to bring some food to increase your stamina. But dig away, once you reach the 5th floor, this achievement will unlock.

_Get all the girls' affection to a pink heart without being married._   
**-=Missable=-**   

This one is pretty self explanatory, just get all the girls to a pink heart before you get married and you will unlock this. Speak to them everyday and give them gifts and you shouldn’t have any trouble getting this. Keep in mind that Karen will leave if the right conditions are not met so be careful there, also, don’t get married until after you have this. If you are having trouble with knowing what each girl likes and such, see Marriage Candidates in the Resources section of this guide.

_Work your first year without getting sick._  

Fatigue is a hidden stat your character has. It maxes at 100 and you start at 0. Fatigue increases if you use your tool during the rain or snow, using your tools after 6:00 will also increase it so try and get your day work done early. It can be decreased by a variety of ways, using the restroom, taking a bath, using the hot springs and such. Also, there are multiple medicines you can use as well. If you can keep an eye on it, I recommend doing so, but if you have a hard time, just try not to use the tool when it will increase your fatigue. All you need to do it make sure it does not get to 100 by the time the first year ends. If it hits 100, you will be sick the next day and will be locked from the achievement. So don’t get sick! If you can accomplish that, you will get the achievement on Spring 1 of year 2.

_Get the Party Picture._  
**-=Missable=-**   

This achievement is probably the easiest to miss and one of the most involved. It is given to you at the end of the game where you have your farm evaluated by your father. If you went for pretty much everything in the achievement list in one playthrough, then you will probably already get this or at least be close. You pretty much need to be friends with everyone and do everything to get this picture, fill your fields (with grass), get most of the Power nuts, etc. The exact list of stuff you need for this is as follows:


1.	Eat 6 (of the 9) red power nuts. The blue power nut does not count toward this total!
2.	Must have 250 happiness.  
3.	Your dog’s affection must be 200 or higher.  
4.	Must be married and have a child.  
5.	Wife’s affection is 250 or higher.  
6.	Combined affection between all villagers is 2,494 or higher.  
7.	One non-starved adult chicken.  
8.	Have all 6 home extensions.  
9.	Have 80% of farmland be grass in any stage (384 squares of outdoor farmland).    

If even one of these is missed, you will not get the picture at your evaluation so make sure you do not miss any!

# Marriage Candidates 

## Karen  

![Karen’s Sprite](https://i.imgur.com/1L1clV1.png)  
![Karen's Portrait](https://i.imgur.com/6qBFfc5.png)   

Karen is the typical alcohol girl in the game. She has long blond hair and green eyes. She lives on the vineyard with her father and can have a bit of an attitude though she tends to open up more as you get to know her. She has a bad family life and often gets into fights with her father. She is good friends with Kai and can get married to either him or you.

**Birthday:** Winter 29   

The simplest way to get her affection up is really talking to her. This involves nothing except talking to her. If you are looking for her, her common locations are:  
- In front of the Carpenter’s house.  
- On rainy or snowy days, you can often find her in the Vineyard cellar.  
- Sundays she is on the beach.  
- Nearly every night you can find her in the bar.

### Heart Events

**Green Heart:** Karen is sick. When you reach green heart rating with Karen and it is a rainy day, go to the Vineyard and visit her. The event will trigger. She will be lying in bed and you will talk to her. Doing this will also increase her affection.  

**Yellow Heart:** When you reach yellow heart with Karen, it will trigger a dream event. There is not much to this other than just reading. It obviously only happens after you go to sleep at night.

**Yellow Heart:** Karen’s sprained ankle. When Karen is at yellow heart and it is a sunny day, head to the Vineyard. You will find Karen near the tree on the ground. You will be given the option to help her or go get help, if you help her, you will gain affection.

**Pink Heart:** Blue Feather. If you have her affection pretty much maxed, she will ask you if you love her, if you respond with “Yes,” she will ask you for a Blue Feather.

**Special:** New Year’s Festival. If you outdrink her at the festival, you will increase affection with her. You do not need any heart requirements, just outdrink her, though I only observed this on Year 2.

### Little Secrets/Tips

1.	If you want to get her affection up quickly, grab your dog, go to the bar at night and just keep showing her. For some reason, she likes your dog even if the dialogue doesn’t sound like it. You can do this repeatedly and every time it raises it so you can max her affection in a single day. Of course, you may miss out on many of the heart events.  

2.	If you do not talk to Karen or befriend her much, you may not see her much at festivals. If you get her affection up, she will show up more meaning more opportunity to raise her affection.

## Elli  

![Elli’s Sprite](https://i.imgur.com/gcUa04Q.png)  
![Elli's Portrait](https://i.imgur.com/T84HIEc.png)  

Elli is a very kind girl who loves her sweets. She works at the bakery alongside with Jeff who she can marry. She has short brown hair and brown eyes and dresses mostly in blue. She is a caring woman who cares a lot for her grandmother who will pass away at some point in the game.  

**Birthday:** Fall 1  

The simplest way to get her affection up is really talking to her. This involves nothing except talking to her. Her schedule is a little more involved than some and a lot can depend on the day. If you are looking for her, her common locations are:  
- On Monday, you can usually find her in the mountains near the carpenters, the Bakery is closed so check there. Sometimes I have seen her on the Beach or Flower Shop
- Tuesday to Saturday is the best place to find her. In the early parts of the day, you can find her at the bakery, this is really the best time to meet with her. Later in the day, mountains or Flower Shop.
-Sundays she is gone, just gone. Don't even try to look for her, if you do find her, let me know where please.

**Green Heart:** If you have a green Heart with Elli, and the day is raining, go visit her at her place, she will be sick. Go through the scene and you will gain some affection with her.  

**Yellow Heart:** At Yellow Heart, you will have a dream when you go to bed. There is really nothing to do for this but just read the dialogue and the Heart rating is the only requirement.  

**Yellow Heart:** Another Yellow Heart event, head up to the mountains near the bridge, you will see her sitting there, she sprained her ankle. Help her and you will gain some affection.  

**Pink Heart:** When you nearly max her affection, she will give you a confession of her love to you. This can only be done at Pink Heart and can only be done before 5pm. You must enter the bakery and the event will trigger. This will also make the day go to evening so do your chores first.

### Little Secrets/Tips

1.	If you decide to marry Elli, she will actually help with the chickens on your farm. She will feed them and even ship the eggs for you saving some time. When she feeds them, it does not take from your current amount of feed so it doesn't cost you anything.  

2.	Ellen will eventually die (Elli's Grandmother), you will notice this getting close if you talk to her at festivals and she is sleeping. When this happens, Elli will be sad but do not worry, she will eventually come around.

This is the tree you can climb to get the Moon Restaurant early before the bridge is built. It is right beside the cave in the mountain.

![Treasure Tree]( https://i.imgur.com/9FSW31w.png)  
This tree is in the northeast of your farm, you need to get this treasure map before you can dig up the Old Music Box in the spot below.  

***  

![Old Music Box]( https://i.imgur.com/Y2xS3x0.png)  
The Music Box is in your field. The best way to do it, is look at where your doghouse and the treasure map tree are, draw straight lines, and dig where the lines intersect.

![Wine Cellar Trick]( https://i.imgur.com/AT9obQD.png)  
Once you have the glass bottle, which you can buy from Rick at the Flower Festival for 200G, you can head down to the wine cellar in the vineyard, use your bottle on the large barrels and you can get free wine. With this, you can drink to your heart’s content and max your tolerance in a single day.
