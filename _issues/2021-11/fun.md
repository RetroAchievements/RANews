## Spot the Difference

Pitfall Harry Junior is on his newest adventure, deep inside a Mayan jungle. While he searches for temples he got lost and currently is trying to find his way out of the jungle. He walked into a circle and was already here before, but some things have changes since then. Can you find all 10 differences in the lower image?
