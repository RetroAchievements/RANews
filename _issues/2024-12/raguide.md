# Game Introduction

The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker is a fun romp across a flooded Hyrule. The graphics offer a more artistic/cartoony vibe making you feel like you are on a grand adventure. The game received mostly positive reviews, though some were not a fan of the sailing mechanic or the end game side quest. Those that have played [Metroid Prime](https://retroachievements.org/game/3154) will recognize some of the end bits.

The game has been remastered in [an HD Release for the Wii U](https://retroachievements.org/game/13243). The vast majority of the game is the same, with the primary difference being a new item in the Swift Sail, some modified quests/rewards, and better Pictograph recognition. Should the Wii U get supported and Wind Waker HD get an achievement set, this guide should work well enough for that release.

# Set Introduction

## GameCube

There are 126 achievements in Wind Waker. 21 of them are marked as missable, with one additional cheevo needing a missable mark. 28 are marked as progression. There's only one win condition achievement to defeat Ganondorf.

# General Tips

* Most enemies offer a tell when they will attack. If you have your sword out during this time, you will hear a panic sound and see the A button light up more than normal. Press the A button to parry/counter the attack and deliver a special blow that can damage or even one-shot certain enemies.
* There are many items to collect and passages to go through. Take down some notes, use a spreadsheet, or perhaps try using a Randomizer tracker to keep up with everything. While all of the collection cheevos will be marked, they only show how many of something you have, rather than what specific ones you have done.
* If going for [Glass Cannon](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/438802), you will realistically only have one heart piece to spare. One is required for a Triforce Piece, and a second will be delivered to you via mail just for story progression. Decide wisely which piece you take, if any.
* There is a New Game Plus of sorts in this game. Beat the game for the first time, and you can start a new game with the following changes:
  * All of the Hylian text you've seen spoken by Valoo, the Deku Tree, and Jabun will be translated into your local language.
  * All of the figurines you made in the previous game will transfer over.
  * As long as you collected the original Picto Box, you will start with the Deluxe Picto Box.
  * Aryll will wear a pirate outfit throughout all of the game.
  * Link will wear his pajamas the entire game. The hero's clothes are...well, invisible in this game.
  * The locations of deep sea treasures may change slightly.
* Note that if anything is missed in this New Game Plus, that is it. There is no third game to carry things over. Everything can be accomplished in the first game, though the second game is a good fallback.

# Tingle's Items

## The Tingle Tuner

On rescuing Tingle in the GameCube version, you will receive the Tingle Tuner. This allows you to use the second controller slot with a Game Boy Advance and a Game Boy Advance to GameCube Link Cable to interact with Wind Waker in some unique ways. For those that seek a more digital approach, remember to dump your GBA bios file. The Tingle Tuner is required for some cheevos.

## The Tingle Bottle

If on the Wii U version, you will receive the Tingle Bottle instead. This allows sending and receiving messages and pictographs through Miiverse. At least, it would if there was a solid connection to a working Miiverse server. As Nintendo's Miiverse server is down, this item is functionally useless at this point.

The equivalent of [Ignoramus Idolatry](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/431156) can be achieved in the Wii U version. The treasure chests still exist. You just have to use regular bombs instead of Tingle Bombs.

# Playthrough

The playthrough below will focus on the minimum path required to finish the game, though a few side quests and key things may be mentioned early. The idea is to show one way of playing without needing much more than the minimum for [Glass Cannon](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/438802).

## Part 1: A Taste of Adventure...and Stealth

Get through the intro cutscene, and save right away. There are some missables right off the bat, and you don't want to deal with the three-four minutes of waiting.

| {% raachpic 399843, 482087, Granny's Stash (2) %} | Find Grandma's hidden treasure. |

You have to head to your house at the start, so go earn some money while you're at it. Crawl underneath the house through the opening, and you'll find the chest with some quick rupees.

| {% raachpic 402392, 500801, Birthday Fine (1) %} | Destroy the pot Sue-Belle's carrying and pay the full fine. |

Upon leaving your house, you'll see Sue-Belle carrying a pot on her head. Use the other nearby pots and rocks and destroy the pot. Talk to Sue-Belle afterwards. If you earned Granny's Stash from earlier (or picked up 10 rupees from other means), you'll have enough for the fine.

| {% raachpic 402393, 500803, Hog Wild (5) %} | **(Missable)** | Wrangle all 3 pigs on Outset Island without crawling or going indoors. |

There are three small pigs around Outset Island. You can pick them up by getting close, though it's recommended to either lead them to water first, utilize all purpose bait (see below), or be very quiet while moving. This cheevo will pop when the third pig is standing up-right in the dedicated pig pen.

For those wondering why this cheevo is not listed first, there is an interesting characteristic with this cheevo. As long as no pigs are brought in to the pen, you are able to enter and exit any building you want to reset the pig's positions. This can come in handy if you ever cause one pig to sink below the ground. Yes, this is a thing that can happen.

Testing has not been done to see if any pigs in their pen stay in their pen in the early game. This is why it's recommended to save early.

| {% raachpic 402394, 500870, With Enemies Like These (25) %} | **(Missable)** | Rescue Tetra from the 2 Bokoblins without using your sword and without leaving the area. |

Continue the story until you enter the woods above Outset. Put your sword away until two Bokoblins fall down. If your sword is still out when they fall and the cheevo icon is still active, get far away from the Bokoblins without leaving the area and put it away to be safe. The best thing to do is bait the Bokoblins into attacking you, and watch as Friendly Fire is turned on for you. If you are lucky, the two will somehow attack each other to finish themselves off. If you are not so lucky, there should be some rocks you can throw for the final hit.

| {% raachpic 402391, 500800, Ready for Hunting (3) %} | Obtain the Bait Bag. |

Right in the water by Outset's docks is Beedle's Shop Ship. Beedle appears in a few different islands, but this is your first (and best) opportunity to get the Bait Bag. It only costs 20 rupees, which shouldn't be an issue at this stage.

| {% raachpic 399844, 482088, Anchors Away (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Set sail from Outset Island with new friends. |

After rescuing Tetra, get the wooden shield from your house and then speak to the pirates to get on board.

| {% raachpic 402935, 500804, Ninja Warrior I (10) %} | **(Missable)** | Set sail from Outset Island with new friends. |

_Complete Niko's obstacle course within 20 seconds._

Save your game while on the ship, but ideally before talking with Niko. The good news is that you have as many attempts as you want: if the target time goes by, simply wait for the time to expire or hit the reset button early and you will get another chance.

The best tip is to go from rope to platform quickly. Upon grabbing a rope, you can hit the A button to immediately jump off.

A [video example by MrDynamite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyEJTPaZl2k) is available.

| {% raachpic 423361, 482089, Unarmed Robbery (10) %} | **(Missable)** | Set sail from Outset Island with new friends. |

_Open all chests in the Forsaken Fortress before retrieving your sword._

Save your game upon landing in the Forsaken Fortress. The challenge icon will stay up as long as you don't have your sword.

There are four chests that count for this achievement: a map, compass, yellow rupee, and a piece of heart. Simply get them all and the cheevo is yours.

For those going for [Glass Cannon](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/438802), you will have to make a decision whether you want this to be the spare heart piece you want. If not, reset the game after earning this achievement.

| {% raachpic 402396, 500805, Carried by the Currents (3) %} | **(Progression)** | Meet the King of Red Lions. |

Get your sword at the top of the Forsaken Fortress and meet up with the kidnapped maidens. Aryll is among them.

Bad news: you are caught by the Helmaroc King and cast aside to the ocean.

Good news: the King of Red Lions will rescue you. You have your new mission.

## Part 2: Are We Learning Power or Courage?

If we are to rescue Aryll and the others, we must prepare for the journey. Of course, that starts with giving the King of Red Lions, a talking boat, a sail. Please don't ask how he rescued you in the first place without one.

There are a few sidequests worth doing while you are here. One of them leads to actual story progression later on, so it's worth taking this detour.

Start things off by going to the Windfall Jail. You'll find Tingle inside the jail. Nearby should be a hidden switch: step on it. You'll receive both the Tingle Tuner (Tingle Bottle in the Wii U version) and the special chart, Tingle's Chart, from the recently freed fairy-man. Go into his jail and crawl through the maze successfully to get the Picto Box.

| {% raachpic 399846, 497261, Otherworldly Connection (3) %} | **(GameCube Only)** | Complete Tingle's first Tingle Tuner quest and collect a red rupee as reward. |

With the Tingle Tuner, you can use the Controller 2 port with a Game Boy Advance and gain special abilities. Of course, Tingle sometimes likes to play games with you, so you may as well go along with it. You'll learn more about what the Tingle Tuner can do, and eventually gain 20 rupees out of the deal.

| {% raachpic 404243, 500806, Apprentice Pictographer (5) %} | Complete Lenzo's pictograph sidequest. |

With the Picto Box, you can visit Lenzo's shop and start the journey to become an apprentice. You have three pictures to take: one of Garrickson putting mail in the post box, one of Gossack being startled in the Cafe Bar, and one of Anton and Linda glancing at each other. Do so and you'll get a Joy Pendant.

Note that if you are on the Wii U version, you will get the Deluxe Picto Box immediately instead of a Joy Pendant.

| {% raachpic 399848, 497248, Stirred Up the Hive (5) %} | Beat the Killer Bees in a game of hide-and-seek. |

The Killer Bees are a group of four rambunctious kids that like to cause mischief. Of course, they will respect those who are better at them at games. Talk to them, then talk to Mrs. Marie inside the school, and finally talk back to the Killer Bees. They'll start a Hide & Seek competition. They always go to the same locations.

* One is on top of the tall tree by the Windfall docks. Roll into it.
* One is hiding in the back of the Bomb Shop. Sidle or Roll Jump to get to that area.
* One is hiding behind the grave that Tott is trying to dance by.
* One is hiding on a secluded platform close to the square.

Spook the kids, then catch all of them. You'll get a Piece of Heart for the trouble. You actually have to do this quest eventually because of some interactions with Mrs. Marie, so you may as well accept it.

| {% raachpic 439033, 500821, Teacher of the Year (3) %} | Give Mrs. Marie a birthday present. |

After completing the Hide and Seek game, talk to Mrs. Marie. She'll be so excited that she gives you 50 rupees.

It may be that you require a Joy Pendant for this cheevo: it's been awhile. If you need one, exit back to Windfall and roll into that big tree again. One should pop out.

| {% raachpic 405066, 500807, Maestro of the Mistral (3) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Wind Waker. |

Go to Zunari's Shop (outdoors) and purchase the Sail Cloth for 80 rupees. You've done plenty so far for your first visit, but it makes more sense to come back later when you have more gear.

You can stop by Pawprint Isle if you want and get a Treasure Chart from the Salvage Corps, but otherwise just get to Dragon Roost Island. Upon landing, you will gain the Wind Waker and learn how to use it.

| {% raachpic 406873, 495399, Bottom's Up (3) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain a bottle. |

Talk to the various Rito. This will include the Chieftain and Quill, who gives you the Delivery Bag. Medli is also inside: she has Father's Letter that is meant for Prince Komali. Deliver it yourself, and...well, he's not happy.

Komali will _maybe_ consider giving up Din's Pearl if you can somehow do something to help Valoo. At this point, chase after Melia who is in chaotic windy cavern. Wait for the wind to blow in a favorable direction and toss Medli to the other side of the broken bridge. She'll give you a bottle for free.

Use that bottle to collect some water, and water the Bomb Flower plants. Break the rock, use some more Bomb Flowers, and enter Dragon Roost Cavern.

| {% raachpic 430465, 495668, Wind Walker (5) %} | **(GameCube Only)** | Cross the gap with the lava jet on the exterior of Dragon Roost Cavern without stepping on the wooden planks or using the Deku Leaf. |

As you make your way across Dragon Roost Cavern, you'll end up outside temporarily. Climb the tall ladder and you'll see the gap in question. In order to get across without using the wooden planks or the Deku Leaf (which you won't even **have** at this point), ask for the Tingle Balloon via the Tingle Tuner. Wait for the rupees to be subtracted and a target to appear below you, then simply walk across the air to the other side.

As this cheevo requires the Tingle Tuner, Wii U users will not be able to replicate this feat.

| {% raachpic 406873, 495671, Rope a Dope (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Grappling Hook. |

Weave through more of the caverns and you'll be outside once again. Climb up the collapsing walkway to locate Melia...trapped by the local enemies. Take them out (along with the special guest Moblin) and she'll give you the Grappling Hook she used to get up here.

| {% raachpic 430465, 500811, Dragon's Hoard (5) %} | Open all treasure chests in Dragon Roost Cavern. |

I will advise looking at [the list of Dragon Roost Cavern Checks](https://twwrando.com/index.php/Dragon_Roost_Cavern#Checks) for this one, courtesy of [blipblo](https://retroachievements.org/user/blipblo).

Note that two of the chests are Tingle Tuner chests. If on the GameCube version, use the Tingle Bombs from the Tingle Tuner to activate them. If on the Wii U version, come back here and use Bombs on those spots instead.

| {% raachpic 406873, 502207, Jewel of Power (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain Din's Pearl. |

With Big Key in hand (or is it Boss Key?), it is time to deal with whowever is messing with Valoo. It turns out that Gohma is here, and rocking a new body of sorts.

The Grappling Hook is the key to this two phase battle. Don't aim at Gohma. Instead, aim at Valoo's tail! You'll latch on successfully. Swing to the other side, and you'll cause the ceiling to collapse on Gohma. Do that three times to pierce through Gohma's armor. At this point, aim the Grappling hook at Gohma himself (Lock On helps). Lang a hit on the eye, and start using your sword. Two or three phases should knock Gohma out for good.

After every major boss, a Heart Container will spawn in. Ignore it if you are going for [Glass Cannon](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/438802), or pick it up otherwise. Enter the Wind Warp to be taken back to the exterior of Dragon Roost Island, where Komali will give you Din's Pearl for defeating Gohma.

## Part 3: The Forest of Beginnings and Backtrackings

Din's Pearl is now yours. Valoo also speaks up, asking you to use the Wind God's Wind or something like that.

| {% raachpic 399845, 495404, Blown Away (3) %} | **(Progression)** | Learn Wind's Requiem. |

Fortunately, the in-game cutscenes point you to where you need to go. Visit the Wind Shrine on Dragon Roost Island and bring out your Wind Waker. You'll learn the Wind's Reqiuem and gain control of the winds. You'll also learn of the two brothers, Zephos and Cyclos.

For now, follow the story and head South towards Forest Haven. Upon landing, purchase a Hyoi Pear or two from Beedle's Shop Ship and start climbing up. You'll have to defeat some Boko Babas and Octoroks along the way: utilize your skills and tools to make your way to the island interior.

| {% raachpic 399847, 495400, Flapping in the Breeze (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Deku Leaf. |

Follow the water source inside and you'll eventually be led to the Deku Tree. He's currently dealing with a Chu infestation. Roll into the Deku Tree (he'll be fine) and take out the Chus.

At this point, the Koroks and the Deku Tree inform you that Makar is missing, and you'll need the Deku Leaf at the top of the tree. Before hopping up, search the floor you are on for a Firefly, and put it in a bottle. This will minimize backtracking for later.

With Firefly in Bottle, hop into the Boko Bulb and make your way up. Keep the Grappling Hook equipped for it's needed to jump into a far Boko Bulb. With enough patience, you'll make it to the top where the Deku Leaf is available. You'll also gain the ability to use magic power at the same time as a bonus.

| {% raachpic 399847, 500819, Scalper's Beware (3) %} | Gain access to the Nintendo Gallery. |

It's time to immediately put that Deku Leaf to use. Glide towards the visible Boko Bulb and take the highest exit to the outside. You should see an island in the northern direction with a circular hatch/door thing. Play the Wind's Requiem and have the wind blow north, then glide on over with the Deku Leaf. The man on this island, Manny, wants you to hit a switch on top of Forest Haven. Now use a Hyoi Pear and you'll control a Seagull for a time. Guide the Seagull to the switch and this cheevo should be yours.

| {% raachpic 439047, 500836, From Dusk 'til Dawn (3) %} | Learn the Song of Passing. |

Now is the time for the first major backtracking segment. Sail back to Windfall Island. You can only sail on regions you have reached already: the King of Red Lions will prevent exploring additional areas at this time.

Upon landing, make your way to the lone grave where you'll find Tott trying to dance and gain a sense of rhythm. Bring out the Wind Waker and he'll show you the dance he's trying to perform. Follow the movements and you'll learn the song.

| {% raachpic 430452, 497259, Head of the Class (5) %} | Receive a permanent discount on the Tingle Balloon and Tingle Shield. |

Head to the square on Windfall with the Tingle Tuner turned on. Simply get onto the canopy above the School of Joy. If this seems tricky, try searching for a ladder to the left of the school and go from there.

| {% raachpic 439047, 495667, Let There Be Light (5) %} | Obtain the Deluxe Picto Box. |

You can also visit Lenzo's Shop with the bottled Firefly at this time. Bring it to him and you'll gain the Deluxe Picto Box.

Doing the same thing in the Wii U version will instead give you a Joy Pendant, though the game will at least acknowledge how things have changed.

| {% raachpic 431158, 490211, That's Cute (3) %} | Obtain a figurine in the Nintendo Gallery. |

You have to head back to Forest Haven, so why not stop at Dragon Roost Island for a bit? You are allowed to take three pictographs (12 on the Wii U version), so may as well fill in the slots while we have space.

Head towards the Postman's Desk, and take the nearby exit. Kogoli should be there: play the Song of Passing if you don't see him. Take his picture. You have until Medli awakens as a sage to do this, but best to get it now and not forget.

Bring the photo with you (alongside whoever else you decided to photograph) to the Nintendo Gallery on Forest Haven. If you hit the crystal to open the way, a ladder will be available for you to climb, skipping the need to get to the top of Forest Haven every time. Enter the gallery, and give Carlov the picture of Kogoli. Step outside and play the Song of Passing twice, then re-enter. Speak to Carlov to have the cheevo pop.

Wii U users can give 12 photos at a time instead of just one. Take advantage of this opportunity!

| {% raachpic 439030, 500818, Back at Ya...Fivefold! (3) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Boomerang. |

It's time to enter the Forbidden Woods. Go back to where you found the Deku Leaf, and find the grassy arrow. Take that passage outside, and utilize both the Wind Waker and Deku Leaf to enter the dungeon properly.

You'll only find one small key in this dungeon. Use it to gain access to the mini boss. You already fought some grounded Mothulas, so now enjoy fighting the winged variant. While it is possible to land a sword swing if it flies down low enough, it may be best to use the Grappling Hook to stun it for the time being. You can parry its long charge attack if you time it right as well.

Upon defeating Mothula, the Boomerang is now yours.

| {% raachpic 423363, 490208, Bountiful Forest (10) %} | Open all treasure chests in the Forbidden Woods. |

I will advise looking at [the list of Forbidden Woods Checks](https://twwrando.com/index.php/Forbidden_Woods#Checks) for this one. Utilize Tingle Bombs for the one chest, or come back here with regular bombs if you are on the Wii U.

| {% raachpic 406872, 495403, It's Got What Plants Crave (10) %} | **(Missable)** | Defeat Kalle Demos without attacking its core. |

You'll have to step out of Forbidden Woods for a time and go back to the Forest Haven interior. Fill a bottle with the water inside. It's magical Forest Water: for 20 minutes (30 on the Wii U), you can use it as many times as you want. Now, bring it with you to the boss room.

Kalle Demos hangs above the room, suspected by creepy tentacles/vines. Use the Boomerang to send him down, making him vulnerable. Use the Forest Water and instantly win.

If you don't have Forest Water, use the sword to defeat Kalle Demos. It may take two or three cycles since he will attempt to swallow you whole after a few seconds.

| {% raachpic 423365, 501486, Farore's Dream (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain Farore's Pearl. |

Simply clear Forbidden Woods and the Deku Tree will grant you Farore's Pearl.

## Part 4: The First Signs of a Rushed Product

With Farore's Pearl in hand, you are instructed to head to Greatfish Isle. You can also head just about anywhere you want now, so consider this a good opportunity to start some sidequests if up for them.

On arriving at Greatfish Isle, you will find the island in tatters, and the land in a perpetual night. Jabun has hidden himself in a water cave in Outset Island, but you need some bombs to gain entry.

| {% raachpic 430034, 495664, Have a Blast (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain bombs. |
| {% raachpic 439034, 500822, Ninja Warrior II (25) %} | **(Missable)** | Complete Niko's second obstacle course within 45 seconds. |

Visit Windfall Island's Bomb Shop (from the docks, turn left). You'll have to enter through the back. Tetra will spot you but not give your position away. Learn the password to enter Tetra's ship and then supply it to the guard.

Niko is ready and waiting to test your rope swinging abilities again. This time, there's no upper platform, but there are boxes. You don't need every rope, and you are allowed to use the boxes. The cheevo comments provide plenty of tips. There's also a YT video of a speedrunner doing it, but that one involves tricky double jumps off the same rope that make it hard to recommend. You can keep resetting the challenge manually for clean runs, so take your time. Eventually you'll get to the other side and have bombs.

| {% raachpic 430035, 501487, For the Love of Nayru (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain Nayru's Pearl. |

Take your bombs to Outset, and sail around until you find a stone wall. You're under a time limit to destroy the barrier before the vortex pulls you under. Just aim carefully and you should be fine. Jabun will be there, and after a (mostly) one-sided conversation, you'll...just...be...given the pearl. Huh?

You can skip to the next part now if you wish, but this part feels empty. We need more distractions, more rewards...ah, here we go!

| {% raachpic 430454, 497258, Lethal Ledgework (5) %} | Get some help from Tingle to find an explosive surprise on Outset Island. |
| {% raachpic 430453, 497254, Second Hand Junk (5) %} | Obtain the Hand-Me-Down Tuner. |

Activate the Tingle Tuner and land on Outset Island proper. Both Tingle and Knuckle will offer mini quests for cheevos, so just listen to their prompts and good luck.

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Knuckle</strong>

Once you complete Knuckle's quest, you'll want to head to Tingle Island and get a pictograph of him. He may no longer be in the world if you get every other figurine made!

## Part 5: Ascension And Descent-ion

With all three Pearls, it's time to head to both the highest point in the land...and the lowest.

| {% raachpic 439036, 500824, From the Sea to the Heavens (3) %} | **(Progression)** | Reveal the Tower of the Gods. |

Take the three Pearls to the three Triangle Islands, and place them on the statues.

* Northern Triangle Island is just south of Windfall.
* Southern Triangle Island is two regions south of Nothern Triangle Island.
* Eastern Triangle Island is two regions north of Forest Haven.

On placing the third one, you will see a cutscene and earn a cheevo. ...poor Link just gets launched by everything in this game, doesn't he?

With the Tower of the Gods now revealed, enter it for your next dungeon.

| {% raachpic 430036, 495666, Tench Hut (3) %} | **(Progression)** | Learn the Command Melody. |

Escape the first floor of the Tower of the Gods to be brought to a central lobby of sorts with three paths. Only one path is available, so take it to the end. You'll find a statue you can convince to follow you. Safely navigate above the light platform so the statue doesn't fall into the abyss and bring it back to the central lobby. You'll then learn the Command Melody, which is needed for the other two statues.

It's recommended to save your game at this point. The next challenge cheevo can sneak up on you.

| {% raachpic 430038, 500826, A Bowyer's Wrath (3) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Hero's Bow. |
| {% raachpic 439037, 500825, Familiar Tactics... (5) %} | **(Missable)** | Defeat the Darknut in the Tower of the Gods without using a sword, save for a single parry attack. |

One of the statue paths leads to the midboss battle against Darknut. He is heavily armored, but telegraphs just about all of his attacks. The best way to fight him is to parry at the start. You will either cut the strings holding the armor up, or do a Helm Splitter to destroy the helmet and expose the head. If you did the Helm Splitter, the Darknut should be stunned long enough to go to the back and cut the strings yourself. Note that the Darknut will move faster without the armor, so it is a tradeoff you must decide if it's worth it. Patience is key to taking them out.

For those going for the challenge cheevo, be careful with even drawing your sword. You can only parry with a drawn sword, but if you face your opponent while doing so, you will instantly launch an attack towards them, disqualifying you from the cheevo. Instead, face away from the Darknut.

It's not clear which parry attack is chosen when you use it, but as long as you connect with it, you are good. No matter which piece you take out, you have to rely on your munitions supplies to finish this battle. This means bombs. Yes, you can knock the Darknut's Sword out, but it is still a sword, so don't pick it up. Either time your bomb throws, or just stay close and go for risky face tanking strategies. Sometimes you can get lucky and have the Darknuts always run from you while you have a bomb out...but then get stuck trying to run out of bounds but failing to. Don't rely on that happening all the time, but sometimes luck is all you need.

No matter how you defeat the Darknut, the Bow is your reward.

| {% raachpic 430464, 490209, Treasure of the Gods (10) %} | Open all treasure chests in the Tower of the Gods. |

I will advise looking at [the list of Earth Temple Checks](https://twwrando.com/index.php/Tower_of_the_Gods_(dungeon)#Checks) for this one. Utilize Tingle Bombs for the one chest, or regular bombs if you are on the Wii U.

| {% raachpic 430038, 496591, A Bell of Awakening (10) %} | **(Progression)** | Ring the bell atop the Tower of the Gods. |

When you enter the boss room, you see Wham Bam Rock just...sitting in the wall. Approach the center of the arena, though, and Bongo Bongo will speak to you saying that you have done well, but must pass one more final challenge: the [Giant Hands of Doom](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantHandsOfDoom)!

Have both Bow and Bombs equipped. Tiki Tong's hands can be stunned with two arrow shots, though do not rapid fire them. Otherwise an arrow is wasted. Rudy may decide to use his hands to push you to the electrified floor or crush you, so do be ready to dodge.

Stunning the hands is not enough, however. Andross has to be stunned himself by shooting the eyes. Each eye must be shot twice: again, let some time pass between each shot. Mazaal may launch fire balls during this time, so be prepared to dodge.

Once the eyes are shot twice, DJ Octavio falls to the ground, stunned. Toss a Bomb into the mouth/cockpit to finally land a hit. Now do this two more times.

If you run out of bombs or arrows, Wonder Bowser is surprisingly fair and will provide some more for you. However, this is at the cost of redoing the entire cycle. Make sure to aim carefully if you want to avoid a prolonged battle with Knucklotec.

Once you explode Ram Rock three times, the battle is over. Get to the top of the Tower of the Gods and use the Grappling Hook to ring the bell.

If you are concerned about missing a pictograph, there is no need. Wham Bam Jewel is still there in the wall. Get a good pictograph and the figurine of Gohdan will be yours the next day.

Hopefully the above section wasn't too repetitive. Unfortunately, we have peaked in both altitude and cheesy trope references, so the only way forward...is down. Beneath the ocean. Welcome to the sunken land of Hyrule.

| {% raachpic 439039, 500827, The Successor (10) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Master Sword. |

From the courtyard you are now in, enter Hyrule Castle. Solve the triangle block puzzle and you will have the Master Sword. **Save your game now!**

| {% raachpic 448433, 506060, Hero of the Hall (10) %} | **(Missable)** | Exit the basement and defeat the enemies in Hyrule Castle's Great Hall without recovering health. |

By pulling the Master Sword out of its pedestal, you not only restored color, but also time. The Moblins and Darknuts are still causing a mess in Hyrule Castle's hall, so it's time to clean them out. They can be defeated the same ways as before, but be careful: they can sometimes work together. Once you defeat an enemy, step away from their corpse: almost all enemies drop something in this room, and you don't want to accidentally pick up a recovery heart. Darknuts in particular always drop a prize orb: these contain recovery hearts almost all of the time if you've taken damage, and the goal is to not heal any damage taken during the challenge. If you take a death and want to try again, you have to reload the save. Keep a cool head and you'll escape back to the Great Sea alive with another cheevo.

## Part 6: Revenge! Sweet Kidnap-py Bird-y Revenge!

With the Master Sword in hand, it's time to rescue your sister Aryll.

| {% raachpic 439040, 500829, The Voice of Boreas (3) %} | **(Unmarked Progression)** | Learn the Ballad of Gales. |

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Cyclos</strong>

Make your way to Northern Triangle Island from your current location. You should see a cyclone near the island. You want to sail towards it to start this encounter. Get a good pictograph if you care about that, and then hit Cyclos 3 times with your newly acquired Bow and Arrows. You'll learn this warping song as a reward.

If you cannot defeat Cyclos in time, you may be sent closer to either Shark Island or the Mother and Child Isles. Double check your Sea Chart and sail to whichever of the three mentioned islands is closest.

From here, make your way to the Forsaken Fortress. If you decide to warp, use either Windfall Island, Tingle Island, or Greatfish Isle. (The next part explains why Mother and Child Isles isn't going to work, but you can get that reward early if you wish.) Destroy the cannons if you wish, and then break down the door.

It is heavily advised you save your game here, while still on the boat.

| {% raachpic 430037, 495676, Drop the Hammer (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Skull Hammer. |
| {% raachpic 439041, 500830, Eyes off the Prize (5) %} | **(Missable)** | Defeat Phantom Ganon in the Forsaken Fortress without L-Targeting or equipping an empty bottle, and without being resurrected. |

You will immediately be thrust into a mid-boss battle with Phantom Ganon upon stepping into the courtyard. Phantom Ganon likes to send blue balls of energy towards you. You can reflect them back with sword attacks, but know it may take awhile. Sometimes Phantom Ganon will teleport near you for a cheap shot. You can attack him during this time as well, causing a similar stun as if you won a tennis match. Once you pull off a stun, unleash your combos.

Upon your victory, the Skull Hammer is yours for the taking.

| {% raachpic 439041, 500830, Left-Over Magic Broth (5) %} | Receive a permanent discount on Tingle's Tings. |

Turn on the Tingle Tuner. One of the rooms is actually a kitchen of sorts, complete with a big pot of stew or something. Simply land in the stew.

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Helmaroc King</strong>

Make your way to the top of the Forsaken Fortress, and use the Skull Hammer to open the door to the captured maidens. Tetra and her pirate crew will rescue them, but command you to deal with the distracted Helmaroc King. Once they escpae, the Helmaroc King returns, ready to do battle.

This is a two phase battle: the pictograph can be taken on either phase, so decide which one while also equipping the Skull Hammer and Grappling Hook.

The first phase is more of an escape sequence. The tower you are in is being flooded, and the Helmaroc King is trying to destroy the platforms you are using. Keep on rolling to get past everything. If you get knocked down, use the Grappling Hook when necessary to swing ahead. Once you get to the top, attack Helmaroc King with the Skull Hammer to climb to the flat portion of the arena and start phase 2.

The second phase requires baiting the Helmaroc King to attack you via pecking. Dodge during the windup, and then swing the Skull Hammer down on the mask. Do that a few times and the mask will fall off, exposing the vulnerable head. Repeat this action a few times, using the sword if you wish at this stage. Eventually Helmaroc King will go down.

There's only one place to go now, so start the cutscene and learn of some possibly forshadowed truths.

| {% raachpic 430600, 495677, The Little Sea Rat (10) %} | **(Progression)** | Learn Tetra's true identity. |

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Tetra</strong>

Both you and Tetra are now in Hyrule. The cheevo is easy to earn: return to the Master Sword chamber. The pictograph, however, can be tricky. Tetra likes to follow you. Wii U owners should consider Selfie Mode, but GameCube owners will have to consider rolling away a bit, then turning around to get a good picture. You have to do this in either the outside courtyard or the main hall: once you enter the chamber, it is too late.

## Part 7: Flying to the Earth

The good news: Zelda is safe. The bad news: the Master Sword is not as powerful as it could be, so it's time to fix that.

| {% raachpic 439046, 500835, Warmest Regards (1) %} | Receive a letter from Aryll. |

This letter will be waiting for you at the nearest post box. There's no reason to not read the letter, so go ahead and earn the free point.

| {% raachpic 439044, 502206, Diametrically Opposed (3) %} | **(Unmarked Progression)** | Obtain the Fire and Ice Arrows. |

Use the Ballad of the Gales to warp to the Mother and Child Isles. If this was any other island, you would be warped near the island and would have to sail to it. Here, though, you warp inside the Mother Isle. Inside this hallowed location is the Queen of all Fairies, who will give you the ability to shoot Fire and Ice arrows.

At this point, the story splits into two paths. You can do either the Earth Temple or the Wind Temple first. This playthrough will assume you go for the Earth Temple first.

| {% raachpic 430038, 495674, Double Up to Catch Up (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Power Bracelets. |
| {% raachpic 438790, 496588, Hot Take (10) %} | **(Missable)** | Retrieve the Power Bracelets from Fire Mountain within 1 minute and 15 seconds. |

You may want to follow [ToastedSyrup's advice](https://retroachievements.org/user/ToastedSyrup) and start from the north-east side of the value with the wind also blowing north-east. Equip the Ice Arrows and Deku Leaf at minimum.

Shoot an Ice Arrow at the spewing fire from the mountain to cool the island off for 5 minutes. Climb up as fast as you can. If you reach a part where you are expected to sidle across a small gap, you can use the Deku Leaf instead.

Once inside, you have to hop across some platforms and do battle with Magtails. You have two options for quick kills here. You can use a parry attack to instantly defeat them. If you'd rather control the pace yourself, use the Boomerang to force-curl the Magtails up, and then smash them with the Skull Hammer. Either way, open the chest that's spawned in to retrieve the Power Bracelets.

If going for the speed time cheevo, how did you do?

| {% raachpic 430039, 495401, Laruto's Legacy (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Learn the Earth God's Lyric. |

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Kogoli</strong>

Travel to Headstone Isle. The Power Bracelets are necessary to enter the dungeon. You'll see a huge stone slab with some note markings on it. Use the Wind Waker to play the song, and you'll earn this cheevo.

Of course, you'll need Medli. Travel back to Dragon Roost Island. If you have **not** taken Kogoli's pictograph yet, do so now before the opportunity is lost. After that, you'll find Medli playing with her harp outside of the aerie. Play the Earth God's Lyric and she'll awaken as a sage. Bring her with you to Headstone Isle and start your trek through the Earth Temple.

| {% raachpic 444204, 500855, Under the Gods' Aegis (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Mirror Shield. |
| {% raachpic 444199, 502208, Skull Crusher (10) %} | **(Missable)** | Defeat the miniboss of the Earth Temple using only the Skull Hammer and without being resurrected. |

This will be your first, but not last, encounter with this game's iteration of Stalfos. They like to get up close and perform their own spin attack. Attack them while they are dizzy. Eventually, the bones will all separate. Destroying the head will take out all parts instantly, but destroying the other parts first may make it easier to take out the Stalfos later on. The choice is yours.

If you use the hammer throughout this fight, the skull hopping phase will be annoying. Either try to use side swipes or jump attacks for more effectiveness.

The Mirror Shield is yours after defeating the Stalfos.

| {% raachpic 431146, 495670, Earthenwares (10) %} | Open all treasure chests in the Earth Temple. |

I will advise looking at [the list of Earth Temple Checks](https://twwrando.com/index.php/Earth_Temple#Checks) for this one. Utilize Tingle Bombs for the one chest, or regular bombs if you are on the Wii U.

| {% raachpic 430138, 506101, Re-energized (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Restore some of the Master Sword's former energy. |

Jalhalla must be defeated to allow Medli to do her part. The Mirror Shield and Power Bracelets are essential for this battle.

Jalhalla is simply a bigger Poe, so get under a light beam and reflect it back to him. The beam of light can move, and Jalhalla also has some dangerous attacks to watch for, so do be careful. Once enough light hits Jalhalla to make him solid, pick him up and toss him into one of the spiked pillars around the room. He'll split up into 15 different Poes...wait: isn't this just [Boolossus](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/427086) at this point? Either way, you'll need at least three phases to take out all of the smaller Poes. If you already have the Hurricane Spin, now's an excellent time to use it.

Medli will add her song/blessings to the Master Sword, allowing it to regain some of its full power.

## Part 8: Growing with the Wind

With Medli safe in the Earth Temple, it's time to address the situation with the Wind Temple. If you attempt to head to Gale Isle immediately, however, you'll find a stone statue blowing a lot of wind against you. While sequence breaking to go past is possible, you'll want the Iron Boots for the intended strategy due to everything else within the dungeon that requires them.

| {% raachpic 439217, 500837, Anchors Aweigh! (3) %} | **(Unmarked Progression)** | Obtain the Iron Boots. |
| {% raachpic 439219, 500838, Run off the Cold (10) %} | **(Missable)** | Open the chest that contains the Iron Boots within 1 minute and 15 seconds of thawing Ice Ring Isle. |

On circling Ice Ring Isle, find either the treasure chest or the initial steps to take you to the upper level. Launch a Fire Arrow into the "mouth" of Ice Ring Isle to start the five minute timer. Make sure the Deku Leaf and Wind Waker are equipped regardless.

If using the treasure chest to climb up, you may have to open it first. At this point, jump attack on top and then reach a ledge with the Deku Leaf. If starting from the initial steps, climb up and start the rush.

Make your way to the floating ice platforms. If you feel you are slipping too much, use the Wind Waker to stop yourself before you fall flat on your bum. This will pause the in-game timer, giving you a reprieve. Hop across successfully and you'll be inside.

If you feel brave, take the "exit" path where the wind is blowing from a secret cave grotto, and time a good roll or two to get past. Otherwise, take the normal path with the ice slides. You can use the Deku Leaf to skip a slide or two if you feel lucky.

With practice, getting the Iron Boots under the time limit should be second nature.

| {% raachpic 444191, 500856, Fado's Fate (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Learn the Wind God's Aria. |

Head to Gale Isle. Utilize both the Iron Boots and Skull Hammer to enter the dungeon. You'll see a familiar stone slab, just with a different song this time. Play the song, and you'll get the cheevo.

At this point, head to Forest Haven. Makar will be hiding in a waterfall. Use the Grappling Hook to swing into the correct waterfall (observe the musical notes) and play the Wind God's Aria to have Makar join you. Head back to Gale Isle and start the trek through the Wind Temple.

| {% raachpic 430040, 496592, Reach Out and Touch Someone (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Hookshot. |
| {% raachpic 444190, 502209, Bound to Earth (10) %} | **(Missable)** | Defeat the miniboss of the Wind Temple with the Iron Boots equipped the entire time and without being resurrected. |

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Red Wizzrobe</strong>

Getting the Pictograph of the Red Wizzrobe is very annoying because they can summon additional enemies. Be careful to take a picture of ONLY the Wizzrobe in question: you don't want a summoned Peahat to photo bomb the opportunity. Yes, that can and will happen...

Equip the Iron Boots immediately upon entering the room, and also have Arrows of some kind for the battle. Locking on may be tricky since the Darknuts may get higher priority, so dodge them and aim manually when you can. Take out the summoned enemies if there are too many, then get more good shots in. The challenge cheevo will pop when the Red Wizzrobe dies.

If there are any additional monsters remaining, defeat them and then you will gain the Hookshot as a reward.

| {% raachpic 444193, 500858, Gifts from the Wind (10) %} | Open all treasure chests in the Wind Temple. |

I will advise looking at [the list of Wind Temple Checks](https://twwrando.com/index.php/Wind_Temple#Checks) for this one. Utilize Tingle Bombs for the one chest, or regular bombs if you are on the Wii U.

| {% raachpic 431156, 490205, Ignoramus Idolatry (10) %} | Obtain all Tingle statues. |

This will fire upon picking up the 5th Tingle Statue, assuming all of the others have been collected at this point.

| {% raachpic 444194, 500859, Hylia's Blessing (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Completely restore the Master Sword's power. |

Molgera must be defeated before the Master Sword can gain its full power. Watch the sand pits that form, and maintain a respectable distance. Fire the Hookshot into the eye and start slashing. Molgera will soon retreat, only to pop up and attempt to fly around and swallow you! This attack can nearly one shot you if you are on a 3 Heart Run, so be careful. The cycle will now repeat with mini Molgeras joining the fray. They should not be infinite, but they can interfere with your aiming, so feel free to slash them away first. Three or four cycles of this should knock Molgera out.

Makar will add his song/blessings to the Master Sword, allowing it to be at full power.

## Part 9: Money Makes the World Go Round

You have your new goal: obtain the Triforce of Courage to re-gain access to Hyrule.

| {% raachpic 438801, 496596, Some Assembly Required (10) %} | **(Progression)** | Gather all 8 Triforce shards and reassemble the Triforce of Courage. |

That's it. That's the one cheevo in this section.

If you feel you are missing anything at this stage, the Great Sea Atlas has the locations of everything not covered in this walkthrough, sorted by island. GameCube owners will want this for the wallets.

Most of the Fishmen have mentioned various locations of the "Triumph Forks". You will be heading to these locations to get the Triforce Charts. Upon trying to read them, however, you find yourself unable to do that.

Do you remember Tingle? He gave you the IN-credible chart pointing to where the Triforce Charts are located. (How he knows of them in the first place is a mystery for another day.) He has the power to make the charts legible...for 398 rupees. Once deciphered, you can treat them as treasure charts and salvage them from the depths of the ocean.

Wii U owners will be lucky and only have to decipher three charts. The other five are replaced with the actual pieces.

| Outset Island        | Access the Savage Labyrinth. The best way to do this is to pretend you are heading to the woods, but veer a little to the right and follow the cliff walls. Then use the Power Bracelets to enter. Make it through 30 floors and the prize is yours.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Translate the charts with Tingle, and then go sailing to each salvage point. The Great Sea Atlas tells you where they are located.

## Part 10: Decorations For the New Garden

With the Triforce assembled, you are now ready to descend into Hyrule one more time. If you do not care about sidequests or pictographes, this will be the final time you go down. Whenever you are ready, head to the Tower of the Gods.

Head to where you first pulled the Master Sword. Zelda should be there waiting for you...wait a second!

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Mighty Darknuts</strong>

The Mighty Darknuts are ready to face off against you. They are just like the other Darknuts, only with a fancier armor set and cape. At this point, the chase is on.

Take the other exit out of Hyrule Castle. Go down the archway and you'll eventually come across a barrier. With the power of the Master Sword and Triforce, you can shatter the barrier. Take the path ahead and you will eventually reach Ganon's Tower.

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Gohma, Kalle Demos, Jalhalla, Molgera</strong>

To continue on, you must go through mini trials of four previous dungeons: Dragon Roost Cavern, Forbidden Woods, Earth Temple, and Wind Temple. Use what you've learned in each dungeon and you should be able to make it to the other side. Ganondorf apparently started to take lessons from Dr. Wily because the four guardians want a rematch with you! They can be defeated with the same strategies as before...and in fact, they must be. You can't use any weapons that you gained later on in the journey! Only the Deluxe Picto Box is guaranteed to be available if you have it, so use it to get any pictures you have missed. I think the Wii U version allows re-fighting these four bosses as many times as necessary, but GameCube owners will only get the one shot.

After taking on the four trials, you will progress through a creepy passageway a strange pig wall ahead, and two passageways to the sides. Enter the right door and observe the lit torches. Now head to the room opposite you and hit the switches with your Boomerang in the correct order. You will activate a portal you can use with the King of Red Lions to head back to the Great Sea via Forsaken Fortress. When you are ready, head back to the torch room and jump down to the Tower Maze.

| {% raachpic 430139, 496589, The Power to Kill (5) %} | **(Progression)** | Obtain the Light Arrow. |

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Phantom Ganon</strong>

Phantom Ganon wants revenge on you as well! The same tactics work as before: reflect the shots back, get some quick sword hits in should he try to clone you, and otherwise be cautious. He also has a pink energy attack that requires the spin attack to send back, along with a clone attack. No matter which attack is used, stopping it and then starting a combo once should cause Phantom Ganon to escape, leaving his sword behind in the process. The sword will actually point you to the next room you need to go to. This cycle will repeat until you enter a room where a treasure chest will spawn after your victory. Open the chest for the Light Arrow.

At this point, make your way back to the initial room above the Tower Maze. Phantom Ganon wants one more crack at you. Use the newly acquired Light Arrows and snuff him out. Then shoot out the pig wall. At this stage, it's a straight shot with many enemies to defeat to open the way to the penultimate battle against Puppet Ganon.

| {% raachpic 444201, 502211, Ten Years At Sea (25) %} | **(Missable)** | Defeat Puppet Ganon without leaving the water. |

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Puppet Ganon</strong>

To get a figurine for Puppet Ganon, get the picture, save, and quit. Head back to Carlov in the Nintendo Gallery for the figurine. You should already have the warp between the Forsaken Fortress and Ganon's Tower active.

For those going for the challenge achievement, pretend the water is a donut. Do not leave the donut. There is minor leeway if you get knocked down close to the border, but in general you don't want to push your luck. Otherwise, the strategies remain the same.

Puppet Ganon will have the same weak spot in all three phases: a giant blue ball at the back of the creature in question. Attack it with the Light Arrow three times to move on to the next phase. Of course, it's not as easy as aiming and firing (unless you are [Linkus7](https://retroachievements.org/user/Linkus7)). You will need to work around Ganondorf's own defenses.

The first phase is the Beast phase. There are multiple strings holding the Beast puppet up. This may remind you of Kalle Demos, and it should. Use the Boomerang across the strings, and eventually you'll bring the blue ball down. Now with one less dimension to worry about, aiming and firing should be simple.

The second phase is the Spider phase, or Bug phase. Puppet Ganon will spin wildly around until he suddenly stops. Then he will fall down. Note the shadow's position and get into a better position yourself. You will not have long to get a shot off.

The third phase is the Moldorm phase. Puppet Ganon moves very fast in this form, so stunning the entire body is a good idea. Utilize your Bombs and try to cause some explosions to hit Puppet Ganon and force him to stop for a short time. Use that time to aim and fire.

After your victory, use the Grappling Hook and Hookshot to make your way up to the top. The final battle awaits.

| {% raachpic 444187, 505459, As Dandelions (25) %} | **(Win Condition)** | Defeat Ganondorf and set sail for a new land. |
| {% raachpic 438802, 496586, Glass Cannon (50) %} | **(Missable)** | Defeat Ganon with only 3 Heart Containers and 1 bottle. |

No matter what you call this Gerudo warrior, he will show why he's the final boss. This is a three phase battle.

For the first phase, stay on the defensive. Zelda has your Bow and Light Arrows, and is not afraid to use them. She will aim for Ganondorf, so make sure he is between the two of you. Once he is attacked with a Light Arrow, start unleashing your attacks until Ganondorf blocks. Keep this up until Ganondorf backhands Zelda, forcing Phase 2.

For the second phase, still stick to defense. Ganondorf will eventually do his own sword combo, leaving him open to a parry attack. Press the A button when indicated. If the parry lands, start your own attack combo. If it does not land, either change your position or try a pre-emptive dodge before the parry mechanic starts. After you land enough combos, Zelda wakes up from the slap.

For the third phase, it may seem like a repeat of the first phase. Ganondorf learned from his mistakes, however, and will dodge any Light Arrows shot at him. Approach Zelda, and she will give the solution: your shield! Stand at an angle while trying to face both Ganondorf and Zelda at the same time, and keep your shield out. You don't want to be hit with a Light Arrow yourself! Once the Light Arrow is reflected onto Ganondorf, approach him and perform one more parry attack.

At this point, you can rest your fingers. You may have to accept a few more cutscene dialog boxes, but at this point you've won.

# General Completion Cheevos

The next section of the guide will focus on each individual island. Altogether, the following cheevos can be earned regardless of which island you focus on.

| {% raachpic 444189, 500852, Boukalophile (10) %} | Collect all 4 bottles. |

Each Bottle's location will be mentioned on the specific island.

| {% raachpic 431157, 496583, You Can't Teach Heart (10) %} | Have 20 Heart Containers. |

If you're going for the three heart run at first, remember that each boss's Heart Container will be back where the boss was fought. The exception is Forsaken Fortress: you will find that Heart Container where you fought Phantom Ganon instead.

| {% raachpic 431155, 496584, Cartophile (10) %} | Obtain all special charts. |

There are 12 charts marked as special for this purpose. These are _not_ the Triforce charts.

| {% raachpic 439029, 500817, Rookie Cartographer (5) %} | Map 50% of the islands on your Sea Chart. |
| {% raachpic 423382, 496593, Master Cartographer (10) %} | Map the entire Great Sea. |

Both of the above cheevos work the same way: use All-Purpose Bait and gain knowledge of the islands from the Fishmen.

| {% raachpic 445513, 505401, Treasure Hunter (5) %} | Collect 20 Treasure Charts. |
| {% raachpic 445530, 505461, Legendary Atlas (10) %} | Collect all Treasure Charts. |

Collect all of the Treasure Charts that require opening them to view a treasure spot and dig with the Grapple Claw. You do not have to dig up every treasure. The Triforce Charts do not count for these.

The GameCube version has 41 Treasure Charts, whereas the Wii U version has 46 Treasure Charts.

| {% raachpic 431149, 496590, High Seas Heist (10) %} | Open all treasure chests on sea platforms. |

Every square with at least one sea platform has at least one treasure chest. Some will have multiple.

| {% raachpic 439043, 500832, Pirate Wannabe (5) %} | Open all treasure chests on sea platforms. |

Each Submarine will be covered in the Atlas below.

| {% raachpic 439028, 500813, Spelunker (10) %} | Open the optional treasure chests in all secret caves. |

The term secret cave and grotto will be used interchangeably throughout this guide. Each cave will be covered below. Remember that Pawprint has two caves.

| {% raachpic 444183, 500814, Krakenslayer (10) %} | Defeat all 6 Big Octos. |

<strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Big Octo</strong>

You will need a Boomerang at minimum to defeat each one, though you may prefer to wait until you get Bombs or the Bow and Arrow. No matter your selection, each individual Big Octo will be covered at their island.

| {% raachpic 439043, 497250, VIP Customer (5) %} | Earn a Silver Membership from Beedle's Shop Ship. |
| {% raachpic 439043, 500857, Indulgent Shopper (10) %} | Earn a Gold Membership from Beedle's Shop Ship. |

Use any of Beedle's Shop Ship locations (except for Rock Spire Island) and purchase as many random things as you can. Use what you've got when you get full.

At this time, using the rewards Beedle gives you is not a requirement for an achievement.

| {% raachpic 444186, 500867, A Tree a Day Keeps the Oceans at Bay (10) %} | Cure all 8 withered tree sprouts within 20 minutes. |

This one starts at Forest Haven, but you will end up visiting 8 distinct islands as you go. Each tree is mentioned on their specific island. The reward will be granted if all 8 are watered before the silent timer expires and the Forest Water is no longer sparkly.

The Wii U version has a longer time limit of 30 minutes, and you can see how long the timer lasts.

# The Great Sea Atlas

![A map of the Great Sea](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/images/a/a8/Great_Sea_Map.png)

Wind Waker's oceans occupy a 7x7 grid of squares. Each square measures 2000 units across by 2000 units down. Islands will be listed from Top Left to Bottom Right.

Each island will have points of interest and specific cheevos that are not covered in the story playthrough above. There may be some overlap, but not much.

Note that the majority of the descriptions found assume the GameCube version. The Wii U version changes some items around, and places five rewards behind new treasure charts that replace the Triforce charts. There shouldn't be many difficulties, however.

| Piece of Heart    | Win for the first time.            |

| Treasure Chart 23 | Win while firing 19 shots or less. |

| {% raachpic 444202, 500862, The Face of a Champion (5) %} | Obtain the Hero's Charm. |

This cheevo's activation is specific to the GameCube version. Simply turn in a total of 41 Joy Pendants to Mrs. Marie and she'll give you this charm.

If you attempt to do this on the Wii U version, you will instead receive Treasure Chart 45. Following this chart will eventually give you 200 additional rupees.

| {% raachpic 423387, 482090, Impervious (5) %} | Obtain the Magic Armor. |

Purchase a town flower from Zunari. Using that flower, start trading with the Wandering Merchants (aka the Gorons) to gain additional merchandise. Once you get a few new materials through this trading sequence (ideally the Exotic Flower), speak to Zunari to receive the Magic Armor.

| {% raachpic 431150, 495673, Everybody's Got a Hungry Heart (5) %} | Receive a reward for facilitating a voracious marriage proposal. |

Ensure the Helmaroc King is defeated first. Speak to Maggie, who is now fancily dressed and near the windows in the fancy house, above the Auction Floor. She misses a Moblin named Moe, and wants to send a letter to him. Receive the letter, and deposit it in a Post Box. Let time pass, and return to Maggie's location to witness an altercation between Ilari the Rito and Maggie's Father, who is [violating the Obstruction of Mail Statute](https://www.usestable.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-federal-laws-on-mail-delivery). Ilari goes to cool off in the Cafe Bar, so speak to him there and retrieve the letter yourself. Deliver the letter to Maggie yourself, get confused by what is written, and accept the Piece of Heart.

| {% raachpic 431154, 506524, The Rich Get Richer (5) %} | Receive a reward in exchange for Skull Necklaces. |

Ensure the Helmaroc King is defeated first. Speak to Maggie's Father, who is now fancily dressed and near the door in the fancy house, above the Auction Floor. While he may not approve of anyone dating his daughter (Moblins especially so), he's more than willing to make money through the necklaces they often carry. Give 20 Skull Necklaces to Maggie's Father and you'll receive Treasure Chart 2 in exchange.

| {% raachpic 430051, 497251, There's Always a Lighthouse. There's Always a Man. (5) %} | Restore function to Windfall Island's lighthouse and receive a reward from a grateful townsman. |

It is recommended to perform this quest at night. Land on Windfall and set the wind direction to North. Take the path behind Salvatore's Sinking Ships game and you'll find a ladder. Get to the top and hit the switch: if the wind direction is set correctly, the windmill will start to move.

At this point, enter Slavatore's house. Instead of playing the game, take the upstairs exit where Kreeb waits by the Windmill...which doubles as a lighthouse apparently. Ride the Windmill to the top, and shoot a Fire Arrow into the rotating hole at the top to light the lighthouse. Speak to Kreeb after doing so to receive a Piece of Heart and the cheevo.

Doing the above, however, also activates a treasure chest on the small island by the Bomb Shop. You can either use your Deku Leaf to glide to the island, or use the Hookshot to drag yourself to the chest. It is this specific chest that can only be opened at night.

| {% raachpic 448883, 506828, Lot Sniper (5) %} | **(Missable)** | Win an auction with a bid of 75 Rupees or less. |

Enter the Auction Floor at night, and wait for the prize in question to show. (See the section below for the prizes.) Each prize has a unique starting bid: go for the one where the starting bid is 5 Rupees. If it's not this one, you can exit the Auction Floor and re-enter and hope for a new prize. If you continuously see Joy Pendants, you probably already have this one.

The key to earning this achievement is to stun your opponents into not bidding at all, but remember to pace yourself. While the total is below 40 rupees, you probably have to increase the bid by 10 rupees in order to stun the crowd. Once 40 rupees has been crossed, bidding 10% is usually safe, though you can probably toss in an extre rupee or two along the way. Try to not bid again until the stun timer expires (usually around 10 seconds).

Zunari will let you know when the auction is at 30 seconds, 15/10 seconds (forgot which one), and 5 seconds.

Bid smart, and the Treasure Chart is yours.

Show the photo to Anton, and let time pass. They may start to say they will see each other in the Cafe Bar. If, after passing time, you don't see Linda by the wooden stairs in the square, go to the Cafe Bar and the two of them should be there. Speak to them to receive a Piece of Heart.

Visit Doc Bandam in his Chu Jelly Juice Shop in Windfall. He needs 15 Green ChuChu Jelly for a green potion, and 15 Blue ChuChu Jelly for a blue potion. Be sure to have an empty bottle before turning in the jelly for best results.

This is missable because each Blue ChuChu Jelly can only be encountered once, and you can accidentally sell the jelly.

## Outset Island

**Cheevos**

| {% raachpic 430054, 497252, Soup is a Hug in a Bottle (5) %} | Heal Grandma and receive a brothy boon. |

Put a fairy in a bottle. You can utilize any visited fairy fountain, or Mother and Child Isles if you have the Ballad of the Gales. Then visit Grandma. Release the fairy while standing next to Grandma and you'll earn both the soup and a cheevo. Even better, you can get more soup once you run out.

| {% raachpic 430057, 497253, En Garde (5) %} | Win a Piece of Heart from Orca for your sword proficiency. |
| {% raachpic 430057, 500847, First Intention (5) %} | Score 1,000 hits on Orca during sword training.  |

This is a game of patience. Attack when you feel you can, but pay attention to when Orca is about to attack. It may be better to adopt a more defensive play here: blocking instead of parrying could be more successful.

Note that there are technically rewards that can be skipped if you get 500 right away instead of 100 or 300, but they are not covered in achievements at this time.

| {% raachpic 444198, 500848, Like a Record, Baby (3) %} | Learn the Hurricane Spin. |

Give Orca 10 Knight Crests. Defeat enough Darknuts and this should be easily obtainable.

| {% raachpic 423383, 495678, Deep Pockets (10) %} | Obtain the largest wallet. |

Return to the Outset Woods with Bombs or the Power Bracelets. Take out the big rock and gain the wallet.

| {% raachpic 423383, 500865, Bait Marks the Spot (3) %} | Collect the rare treasure that the black pig can dig up on Outset Island. |

Return to Outset with the Power Bracelets and some All Purpose Bait. Escort the big pig to the fields on the other side of the island, and use the Bait to entice it to dig for the Piece of Heart.

If you attack or throw this pig willy nilly, it may feel like attacking you. This pig can deal more damage to you per hit than even Ganondorf!

| {% raachpic 444203, 500860, Through Fire and Water (10) %} | Complete the Savage Labyrinth. |
| {% raachpic 444197, 500861, Lasting Trauma (50) %} | Complete the Savage Labyrinth without losing more than a total of 15 hearts and without using magic. |

Have both Power Bracelets and Mirror Shield alongside whatever else you feel you need. This is a long gauntlet of floors with minimal rest floors, and even those floors will heal you for 2 or 3 hearts at best in the early going. This is a long process, so consider bringing with you some Soup from Grandma.

If going for the challenge cheevo, good luck. Be very careful when doing spin attacks: if you hold the charge too long, you will do the Hurricane Spin, which uses magic. Any damage healed will **not** undo the lost health for the purposes of this challenge: if you enter with 14 hearts, heal at 4 hearts remaining, and lose 5 more, that's it. Exercise extreme patience and caution. If you've already earned [Cave of Despair](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/417494) from [Twilight Princess](https://retroachievements.org/game/3934), this one is (probably) easier.

## Boating Course

**Cheevos**

| {% raachpic 439218, 500842, Racing for Rupees (10) %} | Complete a perfect boating course run within 1 minute and 45 seconds. |

Pay 50 rupees to enter the boating course proper. When the time starts, immediately start sailing. You have to collect every rupee without stopping, hitting the sides of tall barrels, or getting blown up. Even then, it will be tight. Remember that you can jump on barrels to maintain most of your speed, but jumping over is generally better.

Each time you complete the course, 10 seconds is taken off the time. It's not known if it can ever go below 1 minute 45 seconds, but it hasn't been tested that far. Consider saving before doing multiple attempts in a row.

# The Nintendo Gallery

The Nintendo Gallery is one of the first collection sidequests that speedrunners like to skip in 100% races, and for good reason. This quest requires constant vigilance in making sure you take all of your Pictographs correctly: a single mistake can force a second run.

As a reminder, you must first earn earn the Deluxe Picto Box. GameCube users must earn [Apprentice Pictographer](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/404243) and [Let There Be Light](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/430033). Wii U users only need to become the Apprentice Pictographer for the Deluxe Picto Box. Then, you must photograph everyone.

The Picto Box can only carry three pictures at a time. When you take a picture, you must hope to have a good view of the face and body. Visit Carlov in Forest Haven to turn any good pictures to figurines. Carlov can only turn one pictograph into a figurine per day. Utilize the Song of Passing (via [From Dusk 'til Dawn](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/439047)) to have this process go by quicker.

Wii U users are able to take 12 pictures a day, and have all of them converted to figurines at once. Furthermore, a notice will appear when taking a Pictograph whether it will be good enough for Carlov to use. While the usage of the Tingle Bottle is not available for additional images, that is an optional tool in this case.

There are some Legendary Pictographs that are a part of this quest. Every night, Lenzo offers these for sale at 50 rupees a-piece. The picture you get is based on the moon phase. Not every character is available immediately: certain cutscenes and events must take place for them to be available. As such, it's best to knock all of these out at once when you complete the Triforce.

There are seven sub-rooms of the Nintendo Gallery, and each one is worth a cheevo.

## Great Sea Room

| {% raachpic 439222, 500844, Great Sea Glaze (10) %} | **(Missable)** | Obtain all Nintendo Gallery figurines in the Great Sea room via pictographs. |

Tetra is missable, and she doesn't make it easy to get a good photo of her.

Knuckle is also missable in the GameCube version: make sure to get his pictograph before getting every other character's first! If you don't have him by the time you complete the Triforce, make it a priority to do so.

| Sam               | Sitting on the bench by Zunari's Shop.                                                                                                           |

| Cannon            | Inside the Windfall Island Bomb Shop. Getting a picture after Forbidden Woods is a good time to do so since he's not manning the counter.        |
| Doc Bandam        | Has a potion shop in Windfall.                                                                                                                   |

This gallery contains bosses, mini-bosses, and strong enemies. Needless to say, plenty of one and two shot opportunities here.

Any of the non-unique mini-bosses can found in the Savage Labyrinth.

| User/Creature  | Location                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Darknut        | Tower of the Gods (miniboss), Overlook Island, Stone Watcher Island, Shark Island, Ice Ring Isle, Wind Temple                                                   |
| Gohdan         | Tower of the Gods Boss. Unlike other bosses, you can return after this one is defeated and get a picture then.                                                  |
| Darknut        | Earth Temple (yes, this is a different variation). Possible sightings may include the Savage Labyrinth, but this has not been tested.                           |
| Wizzrobe       | Any basic variant will do. They first appear in Temple of the Gods, but the Great Sea platforms may offer good solo opportunities for pictures.                 |
| Red Wizzrobe   | Wind Temple Miniboss. Unlike other mini-bosses, this one only appears here. VERY annoying to capture in a pictograph: make sure no other enemy is in the frame! |
| Mighty Darknut | Hyrule Castle's final dive                                                                                                                                      |
| Moblin         | Dragon Roost Cavern miniboss: appears in Forbidden Woods, Forsaken Fortress, and Earth Temple afterwards alongside other caves.                                 |
| Phantom Ganon  | Forsaken Fortress and Ganon's Tower                                                                                                                             |
| Stalfos        | Earth Temple as a mini-boss, Overlook Island in a cave. Sometimes can be summoned by a Wind Temple Wizzrobe.                                                    |
| Jalhalla       | Earth Temple Boss, Ganon's Tower rematch.                                                                                                                       |
| Ganondorf      | Speak to Lenzo on the night of a Full Moon. Technically you could save and quit during the final battle, but that's not recommended.                            |
| Helmaroc King  | Forsaken Fortress Boss. This is your only shot.                                                                                                                 |
| Mothula        | Either grounded or flying variant will do. Forbidden Woods is the main location, though Dragon Roost Island's cave has a few too.                               |
| Puppet Ganon   | Ganon's Tower as the penultimate boss. Consider saving and quitting after getting a picture but before defeating him.                                           |
| Molgera        | Wind Temple Boss, Ganon's Tower rematch.                                                                                                                        |
| Kalle Demos    | Forbidden Woods Boss, Ganon's Tower rematch. You can get a picture of Kalle Demos while it's hanging on the ceiling.                                            |
| Gohma          | Dragon Roost Cavern Boss (Wii U or New Game Plus), Ganon's Tower rematch.                                                                                       |
| Big Octo       | The waters by Seven-Star Isles, Tingle Island, Fire Mountain, Private Oasis, Diamond Steppe Island, Two-Eye Reef                                                |

| Keese and Fire Keese | Either Keese will reward the figurine for both. Just use Dragon Roost Cavern, but they appear in many places.                        |
| Bokoblin             | Any variant of Bokoblin will do. Check the sea platforms, Dragon Roost's secret cave, etc.                                           |
| Bubble               | Tower of the Gods, Wind Temple, Earth Temple. Any variant will do.                                                                   |

| Octorok              | Either variant will do. Try Forest Haven while going up to visit the Deku Tree.                                                      |
| Seahat               | The Great Sea in general, though the Star Belt Archipelago may have better photo opportunities.                                      |
| Kargaroc             | All over the Great Sea platforms, though you may have better options at Dragon Roost Cavern, Bird's Peak Rock, and Needle Rock Isle. |
