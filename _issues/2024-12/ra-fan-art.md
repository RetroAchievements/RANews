Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

The Jedi take many amongst their ranks, including Gex as seen a few issues ago, but Gulpin... I'm sorry buddy, you need to try harder. Maybe next time!

Donkey Kong is playing on his beloved Nintendo 64... with his signature bongos somehow. Maybe that is what caused him to get a game over? He does not seem to take it well though, so a fight with the console it is!

Meanwhile, Kenny from South Park and an extremely round Pikachu just take it chill and play games together. No ragequit moments here it looks like, just chill vibes!

While we are talking about the Nintendo 64, might as well showcase some of the characters from it having a dance party right? Burgins has the party lighting up with Kirby, Yoshi, Mario, Banjo and Kazooie, Dixie Kong, Pikachu, and Peach!

Bendy was tasked with drawing his own Sega Master Force cover, featuring a character from the Mortal Kombat series. Well, Mileena here sure knows how to pose for the photo! Though be sure to buy this issue when you can if you are dealing with teeth problems like she does.

But if we are talking about posing for a picture, then Sonic did not get the memo. Just look at how angry the fella is! I wouldn't be surprised if he came out of the picture to tell me to st- Oops, too late.

But then, we have two more of the same character! First up is GroundedShikami, drawing stickman Ryu in his most unnatural habitat: calm and collected, no expression, just standing there.

But then he got angry when I said that and boom, angry Ryu with energy burning off of him! Now that's the Ryu we know!
