## Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble (PlayStation Portable)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Console              | Genre       |

Quick show of hands: how many of you reading this right now had a positive high school experience? Wow... that is a lot more hands than I was expecting. Okay, follow up question: how many of you wanted to punch someone in high school, right in their face?

Kenka Bancho lets you live out your wildest dreams. Specifically, your wildest dream of committing violent acts upon those who think they are tougher than you. Sure, there's a story here, somewhere, but like in most beat 'em ups, the story is just there to give you an excuse to deliver sweet, delicious knuckle sandwiches to people who get in your way.

Plus you get to wear a banana costume while beating people up. What's not to like?

It seems sense to make an achievement set for X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, or PSP, given that the [original game](https://retroachievements.org/game/19144) in the series already has a solid PS2 achievement set. Building on the success of its predecessor, X-Men Legends II offers more gameplay, a wider cast of characters, and a more intricate plot. In addition to offering players a rewarding challenge, an achievement set would increase the replay value of this timeless game and enable fans to fully appreciate the intricacy and depth of one of the greatest action RPGs of its time.

## SaGa Frontier (PlayStation)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Console     | Genre                                                                                                         |

Are you a fan of the [Final Fantasy Legend](https://retroachievements.org/game/8364) series? Maybe Romancing SaGa or Octopath Traveler? Or are you just looking to develop a set for a quirky little collection of gaiden tales, accompanied by killer music and hundreds of flashy attacks in a rotating 3D-rendered watercolor-like graphics style? With 138 current user requests for a set on RA, SaGa Frontier may be the game for you!

Released to commercial success in Japan and more modest success in the US, SaGa Frontier is the first game released in the West under the SaGa name, previously known as Final Fantasy Legend. In this game's "Free Scenario" setting, any of the 7 protagonists' stories can be played in any order, with a system data file allowing you to start later stories with certain items/moves as a bonus for completing previous scenarios. Featuring a flashy sci-fi fantasy setting and a mixture of pre-rendered, 2D, 3D, and watercolor art styles, the game is a visual as well as auditory treat (composer Kenji Ito still considers this game to feature some of his best music).

Gameplay is JRPG-style plot progression with a mixture of contact-based and forced battles, with up to 5 party members per battle and 15 party members overall at one time. Stat growth and technique learning vary by species and type of move, with some moves being learned in the middle of combat ("sparking"), while others are learned after battle, or even purchased at stores. Depending on the makeup of your party, even the same Scenario can be played very differently and especially boss battles can feel very different. Further variation is provided by the Combo System, with both players and enemies able to combine attacks for massively increased damage (there is even one scenario with a late-game boss battle that requires you to know how to combo effectively).

Good news for newer developers: SaGa Frontier received a Steam re-release a few years ago, which means a template already exists from the Steam Achievements, though certainly more complex achievements would be fun to add (the Steam ones are relatively straightforward and simple, probably to make the game feel more accessible). Come develop a classic PSX RPG experience today!

## Cyberia (Saturn)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Console | Genre                                                       |

Cyberia is an action-adventure game in which you must infiltrate a secret facility nestled deep in Siberia to investigate a secret weapon known as the "Cyberia Project". You play as a cyber-hacker equipped only with a low powered weapon. In order to succeed, you must use your wits to solve puzzles and negotiate with people you encounter. The game uses pre-rendered graphics, similar to the [Donkey Kong Country](https://retroachievements.org/game/337) trilogy, which provides a graphical experience which was very impressive at the time of its release.

The game has several modes, including an exploration mode where you must navigate through the facility and solve puzzles using tools such as a infrared scanner. While exploring, you will also encounter vehicle sections where you shoot down enemy ships using a turret. A large section of the game involves flying a ship through an on-rails sequence across several missions. While the ship is on autopilot, you must shoot down enemy planes and other weapons to avoid damage to your ship.

Fans of classic adventure games will enjoy the trial and error process of navigating the puzzles. While the game is relatively unknown today, it would be fantastic to see it get a set so that others may enjoy it.

Rayman Arena is set up as a sort of a party game, except with a focus on a single player campaign featuring racing and combat modes. There may be factors to keep the games interesting, but they're not as undermining as in other cases. The player does have some kind of control over them: while racing you can open up short-cuts to go faster or block off another player's path; while in combat you have access to different power-ups, offensive or defensive, to use, although so do the other players, giving you a reason to keep your guard up.

Single player is like a campaign mode, where you can play either races or combat, and you'll unlock other challenges as you complete them. There are also variations of said challenges that you can play that are also required to progress, though they vary just a bit to keep things interesting enough. Completing challenges can also award you with new skins for your characters. The GameCube version actually has skins for characters that do not have any on the PS2 and PC versions, including Rayman, even though he just has one.

Obviously, I wouldn't be talking about this game if it weren't for how fine it plays. The platforming and the combat are almost as if you're playing an actual [Rayman](https://retroachievements.org/game/7658) game. Of course it does come with a number of differences to be adapted to the style of game, like aiming being an actual factor in the combat challenges, and the ability to strafe so that you can hit speed boosts on the racing challenges.

While usually party games are not as fun to play alone as with company, Rayman Arena instead gives a more satisfying experience by giving you fun modes to play, with satisfying game mechanics that anybody who plays 3D platformers will be immediately familiar, with less caveats that you'd might think.

Yggdra Union is about a princess named Yggdra who must flee from her pursuers and other Empire soldiers as she seeks to obtain the legendary sword, Gran Centurio, reclaim her kingdom, and avenge her slain parents. It's a tactical, turn-based RPG with active combat and diverging choices that force you to decide who you recruit for your campaign and who you miss out on, even featuring a no-removal equipment system that makes every single choice significant. With its many classes and rock-paper-scissors gameplay, it stands out as one of the most interesting RPGs released on the GBA.

Ultraseven for the SNES often gets mistaken for a traditional 2D fighter, but that perspective doesn't capture the aim of the game. Instead, it's better understood as a strange yet fascinating attempt to emulate the suitmation combat of 1960s Kyodai Hero shows (Japanese TV series featuring giant heroes battling giant monsters). Instead of fast, fluid combos, the gameplay is clunky and stiff, much like the suit-based combat seen in the Ultraseven TV series.

The focus is on dodging, blocking, and timing attacks rather than rushing in with aggressive moves. Ultraseven's controls reflect the awkwardness of the heavy suits worn by actors in the old shows, so it doesn't handle like a typical fighting game. The Kaiju are slow and powerful, forcing the player to be defensive and rely on reflecting moves to win.

It's not a smooth or fast-paced game by any means, but its awkwardness does capture the feel of the slow, lumbering battles from the Ultraman shows. While it's far from polished, the game's attempt to mimic the old suitmation battles is where its charm lies, even if that sometimes makes it frustrating.

Crazy Taxi is one of my personal favourite games from [Sega](https://retroachievements.org/game/5879) besides [Super Monkey Ball](https://retroachievements.org/game/9510). There's a large open world and an addictive arcade loop which genuinely makes me want to find strategies that can prolong my run for at least a few seconds. I want it on the GCN because I primarily only do GCN sets, as the GCN has one of my personal favourite libraries. To have a set of one of my personal favourite arcade games on the GCN of course would be lovely for me.

It's 2004, springtime, my 14th birthday lands in the middle of spring break which means I have the perfect combination of free time and birthday money coming in. I've been scoping out each issue of Game Informer for the last few months and finally found the perfect target. I was never into sports games, but for some reason Fight Night grabbed my interest. The idea of having full analog control for throwing punches and dodging sounded like so much fun, and with it releasing right in the perfect storm of my time and money I decided it would be the game. I pre-ordered and picked it up from Gamestop on launch day. I got home, fired it up, and rage quit in an hour. I thought the thing must have been broken because nothing I did worked and I was absolutely getting wrecked. My entire birthday week was ruined. Fortunately, the next day I gave it a shot, and after some practice the controls stuck and I got good...really good. I was flying up the ranks, floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee. I got top scores in all the training exercises and quickly made it to second place. To this day I can't remember the name of the first place NPC, but I definitely remember beating him. The chance to finally claim the top dog title in Fight Night for all to see is something my younger self would be proud of, and as I get older those opportunities grow fewer and fewer. A set for this game would fill an empty void in my heart.

Rockstar's "The Italian Job", released for the PlayStation 1 in 2001, is a delightful gem that deserves a second look, especially for fans of classic heist films and retro gaming. Drawing inspiration from the iconic 1969 movie, this game invites players to dive into the thrilling world of heists, fast cars, and clever strategies.

At the heart of the game are the iconic Mini Coopers, and driving them through the streets of 1969 London with thrilling music from the movie is a very cozy experience. The controls are intuitive, allowing for sharp turns and exhilarating chases. Whether you're outsmarting the police or navigating through tight alleys, the driving mechanics provide a satisfying experience that keeps you engaged. The thrill of executing daring maneuvers, even if occasionally clunky, adds to the overall excitement and challenge of the missions.

The mission variety is a standout feature, offering players a mix of racing, stealth, and strategy. Each level presents a new twist, from timed races to heist simulations, ensuring that gameplay remains dynamic and engaging. The lively soundtrack, filled with catchy tunes that echo the film's spirit, enhances the overall atmosphere and makes every escape feel even more exhilarating. Aiming your Mini Coopers onto a moving car transport will have you at the edge of your seat!

I always find it interesting to read up on postmortems for classic games, and [this one](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/postmortem-pixelogic-s-i-the-italian-job-i-) does not fail to deliver.

Overall, "The Italian Job" is a fun and nostalgic experience that captures the essence of a classic heist. Its charm and unique gameplay mechanics create an enjoyable experience that can resonate with both newcomers and seasoned gamers. If you’re looking for a retro adventure that blends racing and strategy, this hidden treasure is well worth your time. Grab a controller, rev up those engines, and get ready to pull off the ultimate heist!
