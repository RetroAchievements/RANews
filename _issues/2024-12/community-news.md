## Community Manager
Please join me in welcoming {% rauserpic Nepiki %} as our first Community Manager at RetroAchievements.

Community Manager roles:
- Helping facilitate better communication between users and the various teams to ensure everyone feels heard and supported.
- Helping navigate misunderstandings and conflicts, ensuring our community remains a welcoming space for all.

## Hash Compatibility Testing

The QA-team is happy to announce a new process for hash compatibility testing! This allows users to help test hash compatibility for existing sets. You can work with the developer on testing new hashes while mastering the set to verify compatibility.

More information can be found in the docs at [Player Compatibility Testing](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/player-compatibility-testing.html).

## RADocs Overhaul

[RADocs](https://docs.retroachievements.org/) has gone through a much needed and overdue overhaul. Along with a new look, the new docs have better searching accuracy, language support, and a dark mode theme. Edits to the docs are no longer wiki edits, but rather proper Pull Requests that get reviewed and merged. Information about how to contribute to the new docs can be found [here](https://docs.retroachievements.org/general/contributing-to-the-docs.html).
