# Episode 24 - The Voice of Reason

With RA being around for over a decade, we have users who have gone the distance seeing and contributing to the wheels of change in many shapes or form as the years progressed. From what started as a small hobby amongst friends, has morphed and transformed several times into the community we enjoy today. 

One user in particular has been on all sides of this experience. From user, to developer, to active RA sanctioned tournament organizer - The good, the bad, the drama, and the success; because when you put in that many years you will be bound to have battle scars. 

For exactly that reason, I have my guest here today, VoiceofAutumn - to dig in deep on their history with the website, the community, and some fun events we have on the horizon for all users to test their mettle in.
