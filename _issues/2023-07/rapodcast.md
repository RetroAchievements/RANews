# Episode 12 - Zelda Lore and More: From Agahnim to Zant - Pt 2

Hello everyone! Welcome back and thank you for tuning in with us for another episode of The Retro Achievements Podcast, where we cover a variety of genres, topics, and discuss the bits and bytes of yesteryear! Today we are finishing out our (unintentional) two part deep-dive on the Legend of Zelda story and lore, give our thoughts on Termina as a whole, and spitball some off the wall ideas that may have been spitballed at one time by Nintendo themselves!

Joining us again are {% rauser Sutarion %} and {% rauser Gollawiz %} as our fairy companions to keep us from getting lost in these convoluted lands, a feat easier said than done.

# Episode 13 - As Seen on TV

Today we are setting our Saturday morning alarm early, pouring a hasty bowl of cereal; and rushing to dial in that channel where all our animated treasures await on a segment I'm calling, "As Seen on TV"

Throughout the decades since videogames became a cultural staple, television has always been right there to jog alongside - after all, with gaming being completely dependent on the latter at the time; games played ON a television - it would only make sense to explorer what other alliances could be forged here: games expanded upon by VEWING a television. Just like any freshly burgeoning industry that dares pioneer into the unknown however; there were few paths to success - while many opportunities to fail. 

For exactly that reason I have my guest here today, {% rauser MaxMilyin %}; to dig in on those victories and blunders we've encountered through the years - from line animated to live action and everywhere in between. Don't adjust your set folks, this is TimeCrush at the RetroAchievements Podcast with: "As Seen on TV"
