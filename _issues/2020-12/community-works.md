Some cool works being done by the RetroAchievements fans.

## RAPodcast

In the last month the guys behind the official RetroAchievements Podcast released one new episode:

[RAPodcast Episode 11 - The Melody of Mystery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8st4S_FGDts)

Kudos to {% rauser Draco655 %}, {% rauser Shootzy %} and {% rauser KingS1zzle %} to keep this running.



## The Sega Lounge Podcast

Have you ever wondered "How the heck did {% rauser Scott %} come up with the idea to create the RetroAchievements?"

In this episode of the Sega Lounge Podcast, hosted and produced by {% rauser kc %}, I talk a bit about myself but also about the RetroAchievements inception. How it was created and how it is evolving. Where it came from and where it is going.

Check it in [The Sega Lounge website](https://www.thesegalounge.com/133-retroachievements/) or in your favorite podcast app.
