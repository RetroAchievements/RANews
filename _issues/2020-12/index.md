## What's RANews?

RANews is a monthly digital magazine that aims to summarize what is happening in the RetroAchievements scene.

## What's New in this Issue?

We're starting in this issue the RAViews segment. It's where a community member shows a more in-depth review of a game, or game series, or a franchise, or whatever they want to write about.

## How to Contribute

If you have an idea for an article to be published in the RANews, please go to the {% rauser RAdmin %} profile page and send us a message.

Keep in mind that the article must be written in markdown format. If you don’t know it, you can learn it in 10 minutes following this online tutorial here: <https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/> (it’s pretty similar to what you may be already using on discord).
