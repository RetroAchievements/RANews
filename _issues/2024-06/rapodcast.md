# Episode 21 - Extra! Extra! Front Page with Mr O!

Over the years how we choose to consume media has rapidly changed. From the early days of archaic chisling on a stone tablet, to the newsboy on the corner with his soapbox crying Extra, all the way to our instant access of nearly any piece of information using the computer in our pocket, text and print has remained pivotal. 

For most in the generations which find such enjoyment in RA, we have a nostalgic spot for print in the form of Gaming Magazines of old. Be you a Nintendo Power subscriber, Game Informer, or one of the many others; knowing this was waiting in your mailbox when you got home was a treat.

In another episode where we take a look behind the scenes at RA, we find that the tradition and enjoyment doesn't have to end there. 

For exactly that reason I have my guest here tonight, {% rauser MrOwnership %}!
