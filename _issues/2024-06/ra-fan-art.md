Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up and Challenge League Top 100 events.

**If you have made fan art for Bendyhuman's Challenge League Top 100 task and you want us to showcase your art, please send them to our inbox or let any of our members know, thank you! Any other fan art is also welcome!**

Adol took off on his boat, crashed into another mysterious land as usual... but then, something strange happens. Rather than fighting demons or gods, he is faced by... Falcus?!

Now this! This is the perfect reference picture to a user there can be! We have Kirby, with Kirby-Fridge, enjoying Fridge's favourite pastime: fishing! This picture can not be any more perfect.

Sonic is supposed to be the fastest creature right? Then explain me... how can Mario so suddenly steal Sonic's chilidog? The key to success looks to be a triple jump. We could ask Mario how he does it, but he's already off in the distance wahooing!

Spiderman has done his job of defeating evil, and it's time for a rest. And what better rest could he ask for than to sit high up in the city with a Game Gear? Enjoying the beautiful scenery and the fact that the Game Gear has colour, Spidey is having the time of his life.

Sonic finally learned his lesson and decided to put on clothing. It only took him more than 30 years. And hey, if you wear clothing, might as well have some cool merch apparel right! And who better to sell it to him than our good ol' knucklehead?

Link has fought a lot of enemies over his many years of adventuring, but angry pink clouds might be an adversary he has not dealt with before. Let's see how he fares against them, hyaah!

Pokémon has crossovered with Tekken before in Pokken Tournament, so how about giving Street Fighter a go too? Ryu and uh, Pikachu are setting the stakes high. What Street Fighter and Pokémon characters do you think would be perfect for this game?

Ash, Misty, and Brock are in the safari zone, witnessing one of the most infuriating moments there can be in it: trying to catch a Pokémon with a low catch rate who does not care about your Pokeballs. Give it another 50 balls Ash, maybe you'll have it by then!
