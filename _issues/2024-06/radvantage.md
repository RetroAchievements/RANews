As you progress through the chapters, you'll unlock cars and it's safe to buy them. After all, there are some time limits that the first car won't be able to beat. The barricade type events are the best way to know if you need a new car. You'll need RNG to be in your side during races, specially in the Razor boss race. I just used Porsche Carrera GT for it. Besides some skills to know the right angle to make turns, if you win or lose it's entirely up to RNG.

If you fall behind a bit, it's imperative that you try to stick close to them and keep them on sight. If you can't see them, it's probably already too late. I'm not privy in how the game renders traffic vehicles, but you're going to need them to block your adversaries. If you can't see them, then nothing will stop them and you'll see how they speed up on the minimap. Just restart the race.

You can also use the classic strat of any racing game to check the rear and get in front of them. It will give you a temporary boost and give you some time to stay ahead. Police cars will also do the same in the section of the map that you see at the bottom. I noticed that the police will put the spike strips on the right side of the road, so make sure to stick to the left side. They are close to do it when they get far ahead of you, so be mindful when making turns.

In the last section of the map, the angles are very tight and you have to make sure to memorize them so you don't oversteer to the right in the very last tight corner, since you're going to need to steer to the left right afterwards. Just remember how terrible the controls are.

Another tip in general, but not sure if it works in the Razor race, is that sometimes I noticed that the adversaries slow down when there's a police car far ahead. I guess they don't want to trigger it, but it gives you a chance to get ahead on the race.
