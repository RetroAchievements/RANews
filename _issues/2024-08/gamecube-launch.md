RetroAchievements is proud to announce support for its 52nd console, the GameCube!

The Nintendo GameCube launched in Fall 2001 as a successor to the Nintendo 64. It features a handle so you can whack people with the Gamecube and yell "that's my purse, I don't know you!". The system used mini discs which actually spin backward as an attempt at anti piracy. This primarily worked until the end of the system's lifestyle. Unfortunately the mini disc format was hard to develop for by third-party developers. Although the GameCube was not the lowest powered system of the generation (that honor went to the PlayStation 2), it did often receive buggier versions of ports. Still, the system was not short on power or exclusives and boasts some of the most memorable exclusives in the generation.

With this launch, RetroAchievements is proud to announce this was our **Biggest Launch** of all time with over 100 games here at release. That means GameCube will launch with over 25% of the system's library already available!

This project was spearheaded by [LillyJade](https://retroachievements.org/user/LillyJade) at the coding helm, and the entire project at this point was a good 2 years of work. We also have to thank our partners at the Dolphin Team for working with us to get this product out the door.

We also need to thank the Writing Team led by [Nepiki](https://retroachievements.org/user/Nepiki) who have made sure these sets are up to a high standard for English readability. We also can't forget to thank the Dolphin Testers for taking the sets and beating them with a hammer to find lingering bugs and errors. Finally, thanks go out to the Rollout Team who have helped over the past two years including [Snow](https://retroachievements.org/user/Snow), [StingX2](https://retroachievements.org/user/StingX2), [TheMysticalOne](https://retroachievements.org/user/TheMysticalOne), [AuburnRDM](https://retroachievements.org/user/AuburnRDM), [pinguupinguu](https://retroachievements.org/user/pinguupinguu), [televandalist](https://retroachievements.org/user/televandalist), and [Sutarion](https://retroachievements.org/user/Sutarion).

Furthermore, an event for the GameCube launch is now ongoing as well. Check out [this forum post](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=27246) for all the details regarding this event!

**With RANews, we wanted to take a look at each of the games released during this rollout and give you a short introduction on what to expect. This will be split up into three articles, with each covering a random set of games! Here is the second set for you to check out:**

The real Art of War is to understand all of its aspects. If you've found through Advance Wars that you were a genius tactician, take direct control of your troops and run in the hills, fly in the sky or roam the roads in a vehicle to now prove that you have what it takes to lead the Frontier's Force to victory. You will need Power, you will need Technique, you will need Speed and most importantly you will need GUTS if you want to be the best at war!

Clap, clap, clap your hands! We have Taiko no Tatsujin at home: Bongos edition. There really are no surprise when you launch this game: you want a classical rhythm game and you've got it. Exception made of a few minigames that are a bit tacked-on the core gameplay loop is to play the songs, get points & money for it and then buy more songs. Once you've warmed-up enough try your skills on Gorilla difficulty and aim for that high-score, those gold medals and even the classic Full Combo. On the menu exclusively for the European release you'll find songs such as 99 Red Balloons, a bit of Supergrass, some Jamiroquai or the world famous Don't Stop Me Now from Queen. US release wish it could be half this cool! Well, I guess they do have a few good things for them as well such as We Will Rock You or the Pokemon main theme... And if not weeb enough then hop on the Japan release for an almost entirely different song list full of various anime opening, most importantly including the Hamtaro opening theme song! Don't have any bongos? No worries: you can also play the game perfectly fine with a regular GameCube controller!

By: {% rauserpic Snow %}

The GameCube version of Sega's pioneering online multiplayer action-RPG, Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II Plus features new class & race combinations as well as a brand-new second episode of content just as large as the original game! While online multiplayer is currently not supported for the set, players can still experience the full variety of areas, enemies, items, and quests in offline mode as they journey into the depths of planet Ragol in search of the missing colonists from the ship Pioneer 1. The core set emphasizes plot progression and quest completion for both Episodes across the game's four difficulty levels, but you can also hunt for rare items and reach the towering height of Level 200 with the Grind subset as you explore more of Phantasy Star Online than ever before!

Grab your explosives and get ready for another bombtastic adventure in Bomberman Generation! Six crystals of unfathomable power were collected, but the freighter carrying them gets attacked and the crystals fall to planet Tentacalls. Thus it is up to our hero to restore peace to the galaxy by going through a variety of levels, blowing up enemies, solving puzzles, and finding treasure. The iconic charabombs also return, and are featured in Pokemon-like battles within these levels as well. Collecting all of the Charabombs, as well as Lightning Cards will be the main gist of the set alongside progression, but of course we can't forget about the various minigames as well as classic Bomberman gameplay!

By: {% rauserpic tsyque %}

You know, there are far too many games this rollout. Let's instead sit back and just watch TV for a bit with our favourite electric mouse! Pokémon Channel puts you in the shoes of a player with his Pikachu, where Professor Oak has already handed out too many Pokédexes so he forces you to stay at home and watch television instead as a beta tester for his new network. You got your classic channels like the news with Psyduck, working out with Smoochum, and of course the shopping channel where Pikachu unapologetically steals your credit card to buy whatever it sees. Some channels are interactive while others are not, but your attention will still be required to answer questions about what you saw to other Pokémon! You get cards in return, which will be the main thing standing between you and a mastery, so good luck and enjoy a break with Pokémon Channel!

| {% ragamepic 6238, 075893, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat %} | 2D Platforming |

By: {% rauserpic MGNS8M %}

A DK Adventure with Bongo-Pounding Controls! From the team that would later make Mario Galaxy, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat was a return to form for the most popular videogame gorilla. After a controversial (if very funny) DK64, no one had heard of him in a while but the King of the Kong is back better than ever. Wild beasts roam the jungle and a new group of baddies have staked their claim on all the bananas! This simply cannot stand so clap and punch your way through the competition!
Be assured that if you don't have access to the official Bongos (or don't want to use them) this is a game that can perfectly be played without. 

| Game                                                                     | Genre                         |

By: {% rauserpic Jenettebaghead %}

The Tales series would return to the GameCube with the first ever 3D game in the series, and what a hit it was. Commonly seen as one of the best games in the franchise with protagonist Lloyd even being part of the logo, Tales of Symphonia is the fifth entry in this long-running series of action RPGs. With the land dying due to a steady loss of mana, it is up to the chosen one Colette to travel around the world on a journey of world regeneration, awakening the summon spirits and becoming an angel at the end. She is a bit of a klutz though... so good thing Lloyd and friends are ready to help out! After all, he fights with two swords, and that makes him twice as strong! Spam Demon Fang and Double Demon Fang, defeat enemies and collect all titles and items to show you are the true master of Sylvarant. And if you're especially brave, check out the Gung Ho Run subset as well to prove you don't need levelling to fight your enemies!

Step into the wild, rugged region of Orre because it's time to add some much-needed edge to the Pokémon franchise on RetroAchievements! This entry flips the script, putting you in the shoes of Wes, a former Team Snagem member who steals their prized Snag Machine, which allows him to capture other trainers' Pokémon. Oh, and he bombs their hideout in the process... Wes meets a mysterious girl in the next town who insists on keeping him in line. Can't have a Pokémon game be too dark now, can we?

The game features stunning 3D graphics with unique animations for each Pokémon, reminiscent of Pokémon Stadium. Story Mode battles are exclusively Double Battles, adding complexity to each encounter, while Battle Mode supports both Doubles and Singles. The achievement set will test you in every mode, as you catch and purify all Shadow Pokémon and reach the peak of Mt. Battle. Overcome all challenges, and become a legend of Orre!

The GameCube had another exclusive golf game next to our Italian plumber, namely Swingerz Golf! In this simulation game, choose from 14 different characters and play across 6 courses, all varying in difficulty and atmosphere. Change clubs and control the power of your swing to get the ball as close as possible to the hole, with stamina being lost- or regained depending on the accuracy. Choose from a variety of modes like the usual normal matches and strokes mode, but also a tour mode to stimulate the career of each character, a mission mode consisting of multiple challenges, and a bunch of minigames. With a beefy set at your hands, this is one of the most detailed golf games you can find on RetroAchievements!

GOOD MORNING! Morning Land has been invaded by Crows and now it is time for Billy and friends to show that they are no chickens! Rolling (an egg) around at the speed of sound, you will have to traverse colorful levels to save the elders and restore peace to the place. No gorgeous chick to save this time, just a group of kids in their fursuit having an eggcellent time. Truly a game that has never had its vibe replicated since, proving once more that Yuji Naka (of Sonic fame) will never make a bad game in his entire career.

His mortal enemy Black Manta has returned to once again attempt to destroy the kingdom of Atlantis, and it is up to Aquaman to prevent the city falling into doom in a story told like it was ripped straight out of a comic book. Swim through more than 20 levels, fighting opponents in underwater combat and sometimes piloting crafts to shoot down enemy crafts. Several of these missions also come with challenge achievements, like doing it under a specified time or not engaging in combat at all. I hope you are ready to show off your swimming skills!

A lot of Nintendo's franchises had a spotlight on the Nintendo GameCube, be it completely new franchises or the ones we are already used to. While technically not new, Doshin the Giant would see its first game get re-released, as well as making it the first time the west got to see this friendly giant... at least, if you lived in Europe. In this god simulation game, you take control of the titular giant who goes around the island to help them with all things they need to live a happy life... or do the opposite as his evil alter ego Jashin the Giant, making the life of the inhabitants a living hell. Focusing on one side at a time makes the giant absorb emotions and grow in size, just to repeat the same the day after. For this set, you'll have to prove you can please both sides, inspiring the villagers to build monuments as well as picking up the variety of animals around the island. Whatever you do is up to you because after all, you are god, and therefore the fate of the inhabitants lay in your hands!
