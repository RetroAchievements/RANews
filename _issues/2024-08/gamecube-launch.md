RetroAchievements is proud to announce support for its 52nd console, the GameCube!

The Nintendo GameCube launched in Fall 2001 as a successor to the Nintendo 64. It features a handle so you can whack people with the Gamecube and yell "that's my purse, I don't know you!". The system used mini discs which actually spin backward as an attempt at anti piracy. This primarily worked until the end of the system's lifestyle. Unfortunately the mini disc format was hard to develop for by third-party developers. Although the GameCube was not the lowest powered system of the generation (that honor went to the PlayStation 2), it did often receive buggier versions of ports. Still, the system was not short on power or exclusives and boasts some of the most memorable exclusives in the generation.

With this launch, RetroAchievements is proud to announce this was our **Biggest Launch** of all time with over 100 games here at release. That means GameCube will launch with over 25% of the system's library already available!

This project was spearheaded by [LillyJade](https://retroachievements.org/user/LillyJade) at the coding helm, and the entire project at this point was a good 2 years of work. We also have to thank our partners at the Dolphin Team for working with us to get this product out the door.

We also need to thank the Writing Team led by [Nepiki](https://retroachievements.org/user/Nepiki) who have made sure these sets are up to a high standard for English readability. We also can't forget to thank the Dolphin Testers for taking the sets and beating them with a hammer to find lingering bugs and errors. Finally, thanks go out to the Rollout Team who have helped over the past two years including [Snow](https://retroachievements.org/user/Snow), [StingX2](https://retroachievements.org/user/StingX2), [TheMysticalOne](https://retroachievements.org/user/TheMysticalOne), [AuburnRDM](https://retroachievements.org/user/AuburnRDM), [pinguupinguu](https://retroachievements.org/user/pinguupinguu), [televandalist](https://retroachievements.org/user/televandalist), and [Sutarion](https://retroachievements.org/user/Sutarion).

Furthermore, an event for the GameCube launch is now ongoing as well. Check out [this forum post](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=27246) for all the details regarding this event!

**With RANews, we wanted to take a look at each of the games released during this rollout and give you a short introduction on what to expect. This will be split up into two articles, with each covering a random set of 50 games! Here is the first set for you to check out:**
