## Stunt Race FX (SNES/Super Famicom)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Console            | Genre         |

Some older racing games really wanted to sell you on the illusion of going through a 3D environment while racing. However, the technology of the time couldn't truly do 3D, so developers would have to use sprites and clever programming to provide the illusion of 3D. Enter the SNES, and the Super FX Chip! This little chip could allow the SNES to output very basic 3D graphics and polygons.

And so, Stunt Race FX came about; an early 3D racing game, and one that's very fun in my opinion! Choose between 4 cartoon vehicles and race through a variety of environments, along with a Stunt mode that's more of an obstacle course mode than racing. The graphics are pretty charming and the music is really good, too. However the main drawback of the game is the framerate; it's not the greatest, thanks to the tech. But it doesn't ruin the enjoyment too much.

The fact that this game doesn't have a set yet is kinda surprising to me. The cheevos could be very standard for a racing game, such as completing each cup and time trial achievements, but there's also a bonus game, and the aforementioned obstacle course mode, so there's lots of potential for a cool achievement set for this game. Not to mention there's unlockables!

So, if you want to experience a wonderful racing game with great graphics and cool music, then I urge you to wish this set!

## My Chinese Coach: Learn to Speak Chinese (Nintendo DS)

Gamer, as you sit before me reading this RANews edition on break from grinding whatever game you're grinding, you are clearly interested in a chance to sit, read, and perhaps learn something new. What if I told you there was a way for you to do that while grinding a game, and to have that "something new" be, that's right, Mandarin Chinese?

I know you're starting to get excited, but you'll need to calm down a little bit as I explain. My Chinese Coach, a member of the illustrious [My Coach](https://retroachievements.org/game/7543) series of educational games, contains compact lessons that will teach you Chinese vocabulary as well as memorization drill minigames that allow you to match the characters of Chinese words to their spoken versions or their romanized spelling.

The real question is: will you actually be able to meaningfully learn Mandarin from this game? And the answer to that is: absolutely not. Why, then, do I want a set for it?

To put it simply: language should be celebrated and highlighted. While I am immensely pleased that already have sets for the [Spanish](https://retroachievements.org/game/14963), [French](https://retroachievements.org/game/14965), and [Japanese](https://retroachievements.org/game/14961) versions of the My Coach language series, I feel that all of these games deserve sets. They're an interesting artifact of video game history, and I truly feel that they are a great first way to interact with the basic concepts behind second language acquisition. Just as Duolingo is a jumping off point from which you cannot become fluent in any language alone, the My Coach games can be seen as more of a gateway, a gateway into something very grand and fulfilling: the humble beginnings of learning a second language.

Maybe someone who only speaks English sees a set for My Chinese Coach and laughs because educational games have historically been seen as a little silly. But then maybe they try it out to see what the set is like. Then they learn about the tonal system in Mandarin, a system of vowel contrast far different than anything they're familiar with in their own language. Even the smallest discovery like this can spark a lifetime of learning.

So the reason I want a set for My Chinese Coach isn't because I think it is a genuinely good learning tool in its own right, but rather that I think it could provide inspiration to pursue learning. And we can celebrate a language and the cultures surrounding it along the way!

## Destroy All Humans! 2 (PlayStation 2)

| Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Console       | Genre                                                       |

You ever feel like yeeting a hippie into a tank while hiding inside the body of a Russian soviet?
Well, look no further than Destroy All Humans! 2. Picking up after the events of the first game, Crypto, the Furon, heir to the Sacred Crotch, is now the president of the United States via some body-snatching mind control shenanigans and is enjoying the age of the hippies - that is, until the KGB sent a nuke at his mother-ship and blew it to hell, killing his mentor Pox in the process. Much to Crypto's annoyance, however, Pox downloaded his consciousness into a drone and is guiding Crypto along to find out who was responsible for the attack.

Throughout your journey you get some insane weapons that include a disintegration ray, a taser on steroids, a gun that just picks up stuff and flings it around, a gun that just channels your inner Sephiroth and summons meteors from space, a gun that summons an ALASKAN BULL WORM but more alien-like, and several other fun weapons. You get to go around the world and even the moon on this game, compared to just staying in the US in the first game, and your missions have more variety as well, usually requiring you to "destroy all humans" so to speak. The game even has splitscreen multiplayer so you can cause destruction with a friend if you're so inclined. Oh, and don't forget about your alien saucer, where you use death rays, alien nukes, the power of sound, and abduction beams to destroy and terrorize the populace.

This game needs a set, if the memory can be cracked.

While I'm aware not a lot of Americans (as in North AND South) have heard of Asterix and Obelix, this franchise was the bread and butter of many a European kid's childhood, and this game was one of the many highlights. The remake on Steam was alright, but you gotta experience the OG. In my honest opinion, it's one of the best 3D action-adventure games I've played! The vibes are immaculate, the art style is fantastic, the gameplay is clean and enjoyable - what more could you want out of a PS2 beat 'em up/3D platformer/adventure game? Definitely recommend!

The game I want to get a set is Cars 1 for PSP for a few reasons:

I'm a pretty big fan of the Cars franchise and the series has plenty of great games, so I think it's a crime that [Mater-National](https://retroachievements.org/game/20700) for PS2 and both of the [GBA](https://retroachievements.org/game/7221) [games](https://retroachievements.org/game/7299) are the only games with achievement sets.

This game is actually pretty bad in my opinion. The controls and the story are the only positives for me; the graphics are ugly as hell for PSP standards, the CPUs cheat at times, and the game is quite glitchy. So why do I want this game to get achievements? Simple - I played this entire game in a Discord call with a few friends and we laughed a lot playing it. The game was so bad that it became a running joke in my friend group, and I promised them that once this game gets a set we would make a Let's Play of it and get every achievement, because if we ever decide to play that game again, it has to be worth it.

Here's a few achievement ideas for it:

* One achievement for winning each race in the Story Mode
* A few achievements for getting all the Postcards in every track, which is a mode similar to the CTR Letters in [Crash Team Racing](https://retroachievements.org/game/10438)
* One achievement for completing each Time Trial
* Achievements for unlocking every character and winning a race with each one (some of the characters are only unlockable via cheat codes)
* A achievement for beating the story mode without using McQueen or Mater

Please and thank you.

## Bujingai: The Forsaken City \| Bujingai: Swordmaster (PlayStation 2)

A couple years ago before I was big into RA, I was going crazy with PS2 emulation and playing any and every game I could find. I stumbled onto this one and realized I had struck gold. Bujingai is a hack and slash game where you play as Lau Wong, a swordsman embarking on a journey to rescue the soul of his kidnapped lover from his possessed former friend Rei.

The presentation of the game is meant to be serious, but it's so outwardly eccentric that it tips into the realm of being funny every time there is a cutscene. I mean, you're playing as Gackt, it can't be that serious. Combat is very fun and has a counterattack system that is quite easy to get sucked into. Fights with enemies later in the game will turn into a flamboyant dance of death. God, I love Wuxia. The music in the game is quite epic as well; its like a mix of heavy metal and Chinese instrumentals, which fuels the feeling of immersing yourself into being a swordmaster cutting down demons.

Overall I'd say this game has very good potential for achievements, as there are upgrades you can make to your health/counter/magic meters, multiple difficulties, and coins throughout the levels you can collect for bonus content like behind the scenes videos, character viewers, and a special costume for Lau.

Many people who are into gaming probably know who David de Gruttola is, or perhaps by his better known name David Cage. He is the founder of the game studio Quantic Dream, known for games like Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls, and Detroit: Become Human. His games have a heavy emphasis of telling captivating and intriguing stories, while giving the player several choices on how the story goes.

This all begun with the game Fahrenheit released in 2005. A man from New York City called Lucas Cane was in the toilet of a diner, as his body was in a trance-like state, committing a murder. As Lucas tries to find out the truth behind this mysterious night, two Detectives of the NYPD called Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles are trying to find the murderer. What all three don't know is that they will go down a rabbit hole that they never could've imagined.

For its time this game was an incredible achievement in video game storytelling. While people argue if the story of this game is actually good or not, you would do yourself a disservice not playing this game. There is no other game like this one on the PlayStation 2.

You can make a good set with this game, with the different routes and the different collectibles you can get, and also a few hilarious scenes that I don't want to spoil here (all I'll say is aspirin and alcohol).

Big Bang Mini was one of the DS demos that I spent a very long time playing back when DS Download Stations were around, and it was one that stuck with me. The game feels like it was put together with so much love that it's hard to dislike. While technically a shoot 'em up, Big Bang Mini plays very differently from other games - everything is controlled by the stylus, and you can pick up and move your character to dodge attacks, while swiping on any part of the screen to launch a firework/attack from that point in the same direction that you swiped. It's the kind of game that would have been extremely well received as a smartphone game, and yet it ended up on the DS instead - allowing it to receive RetroAchievements now, 15+ years later.

It has a set under development, but I just want to express how badly I want a set for Custom Robo. This is my favorite game on the GameCube. It has everything: huge amount of customization to suit your playstyle, 2000's era DeviantArt-style dialogue portraits, funny writing that takes advantage of your assumptions of the world you exist in (flat earth is literally canonically true and grass isn't real. These are not exaggerations or embellishments and I won't be elaborating), and the game even has a small competitive scene out there.

Ah, Cars. The tie-in game that brought a lot of us our childhoods. Whether you're a fan of the movie, or racing, Cars is sure to bring you a delightful journey across Carburetor County. As someone who has fully completed the PC version of the game several months ago (100%, so all trophies, paint jobs, and bonus content), I would love to see a set for this game. I am aware of the difficulty that the PS2 version has when it comes to developing achievements, because of the messy, inconsistent, and often changing memory. I am hoping that the GameCube version is void of these transformative memory addresses, or at least not containing as much of them, so that we have another Cars game to try out and get points for it. What will the set contain? I'm not entirely sure, but possibly doing stuff around the open world/road would provide some great ideas for achievements.
