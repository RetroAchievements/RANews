Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

Gex is on his way to become a Jedi Master, but is not ready yet... says who! Gex himself decided whether or not he is a Jedi Master, and what are they going to do about it? It's Gex after all!

Bulbasaur used Gun. It's super effective! Witness the epic duel between the tag team of Bulbasaur and... Kermit, and Beedrill and.... Bee. What an epic match up!

Happy birthday Mario! All of his friends have come over to celebrate, with Banjo providing the music on his... banjo, Dixie and Peach celebrating with champagne, and Pikachu electrifying the cake. Good thing Kirby ate the cake and became one himself!

Link is ready to go on another journey, bringing his trusty steed Epona and that slightly annoying fairy Navi. Where will the adventure take him today? Death Mountain is looking ready to take of challengers!

We have another edition of Pokémon vs. Pocket Fighter! This time, Impferno93 brings up the cover of Lucario and Ryu duking it out with each other in a puzzle game to see who is the strongest fighter of them all.

Ash, Misty, and Brock head off to the safari zone. Lucky for them, two Pokémon are awaiting to be caught, with our favourite Dratini in the water making an excellent edition to Ash's team! ...if he evolved his Pokémon for once that is.

Link keeps having trouble with those three pink clouds, but this time he is ready. Clouds may not take damage from a sword, but being sucked up is another story. Enjoy this pixel art rendition by Kuriboh908!
