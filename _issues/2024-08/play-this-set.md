Greetings to everyone who is in RA or is somehow connected with it. Today, I have TWO sets of achievements in mind. First, a little bit about the game itself: it's a fighting game in the universe of the blue prickly friend. Eggman finds a special robot, referred to later in the Story as "Emerl". The story is divided into several chapters and is interesting to read. In addition to a simple "story", there are tests and other features.

The most remarkable things that I discovered while going through these sets many years after originally playing were secrets that I did not even suspect were in the game, like "speeding up history", "mini-games", or even "6 points for a clean victory over two bots". Apart from the secrets, I was surprised by the HONESTY of the two sets equally. And this is not a joke, I believe that these sets are fair and just. If you want to pump up your skill to the maximum and discover every secret hidden in the game, a BONUS set is at your service.

Personally, besides the fact that I enjoyed these sets, I also immersed myself even more in the game. THANK YOU to the authors of these sets. Respect and embrace.

Baby Felix Halloween, originally released for the Game Boy Color on December 19th, 2001, is a short 5 level platformer. The story involves Felix and Kitty having to save their friends during Halloween night. It's definitely a simple story. The gameplay is a usual 2D platformer. You have an health bar and 2 ways of attacking: Felix using his hat (or wand if you are playing as Kitty), which deals a good amount of damage, and Felix's slingshot (Kitty's magic) which is used to fire projectiles but can only fire 25 shots until you have to refill by finding ammo in the stages. The controls themselves are decent. Climbing up is a bit clunky, but other than that they are fine. The sprites look decent. However, the best part of the game is the music, which is pretty good - I would recommend it for a listen.

The set itself is pretty great and covers the game pretty well. The hardest achievements were [Bee master](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/77593), [Cat Who Kept His Lives](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/77599), and [Unstoppable](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/77598).

Everybody here should know about [Super Mario 64](https://retroachievements.org/game/10003), a revolutionary 3D game back then, shaping 3D Gaming as we know it today. The innovative controls and Mario's moveset make this a fun platformer, and it has very iconic levels such as Bob-omb Battlefield, Cool, Cool Mountain, and more. Trust me, I love this game way too much, but if you think about it, doesn't the game give weird vibes sometimes? Like, Peach's Castle is more like a giant empty art gallery, with very little hints of furniture and some bare Toads scattered who will always repeat the same things over and over. Maybe I'm going too deep into this, but there is a potential reason for this... Well, not really, but something that tries to replicate that feeling, and that is this hack.

B3313 is based off the various SM64 hoaxes and rumors, the "Greenio: CLASSIFIED" series, and found beta footage of SM64. It builds on top of the PERSONALIZATION AI concept, one of the biggest myths of beta copies of SM64, being a trapped consciousness in lost copies of the game. I won't go into too much detail since it's a lot, so check it out if you're interested. "Oh, it's just another one of these gazillions of creepypastas" you may say, but... Well... You're partially right, but please standby, as this isn't the game's focus at all. In fact, you'll find very little spooky stuff in it compared to the rest of the game, and wow, it's massive. You'll find areas similar to known areas, beta-based areas, areas you might've seen in your dreams, areas based on the past and future, and even more areas. It's all a giant maze of connecting doors and twisting hallways to explore, while keeping a beta aesthetic and feeling AI generated, which adds to the surreal experience. I won't go into more detail since this game is best played blind.

So, if you like SM64 and are curious about beta-ish stuff and the like, check this out, you will definitely have a one of a kind experience. So lets get inTo The Sh0w, ITs connEcTed TO A vaRIEtY Of WORldS, SO OPeN tHE dOORS AHEAD AND GET ADVENTURING!

"Don't worry Jak! I'll save you before you know it!"

Have you ever wondered what Daxter was doing that time? Saving Jak? Rebelling against the Krimzon Guard's oppression? Beating the snot out of Metal Heads? WRONG! In this game, you play an unexplored side of Daxter - down on his luck and unsure of what to do after the events of [The Precursor Legacy](https://retroachievements.org/game/2774). After being offered a job by a bug extermination company, Orange Lightning starts to find his feet again, without the help of his sidekick Jak, girlfriend Keira, and her grumpy old daddy Samos.

Rather than using traditional firearms, Daxter relies on a bug swatter and a spray-gun to traverse the more civilised parts of Haven City not shown in [Jak II](https://retroachievements.org/game/3062), as well as a few returning areas. These include the Lumber Mill, Tanker, and the Fish Cannery. You may even see a few familiar faces along the way. Apart from the traditional gameplay shown in most of the Jak games, there are also QTE mini-games that pay homage to pop culture films, such as The Lord Of The Rings and The Matrix. They are well worth the effort, as these will help Daxter in combat, as well as increase his health.

In terms of the actual set, I would consider it fair compared to the rest of the series, which include obnoxiously difficult combat challenges. It's a lot more of a leisurely journey - and certainly not a necessary one if you don't want to play it, but anyone who adores the character Daxter surely must give it a try!

Does each person come into this world with a set destiny, or is it their life experiences that define them? Could the same person go through completely different life stories and still hold onto the same personality and worldview?

Breath of Fire IV asks this question a few times, trying to explore the nuances through the eyes of Ryu and Fou-Lu. Yeah, it's one of those games where you can play as the supposed "villain" (with lots of air quotes), a narrative style I'm really into. Throughout their journey, both characters will face similar experiences, but with wildly different intensity levels, shaping the thoughts of both Fou-Lu and YOU toward different conclusions about humanity.

I emphasize YOU for a good reason because in this game we're dealing with the classic silent protagonist, which, in my opinion, fits perfectly with what the story aims to achieve. Right from the start, Ryu enters the world like a newborn (almost literally, since he's lacking even clothes), no background, no acquaintances, no memories of anything in his life up to that point. All his experiences and worldview will be purely shaped by the journey that kicks off right then and there, meaning Ryu is basically just like the player, making it a lot easier to step into his shoes and taking the conflict of these "worldviews" to a more personal level.

The game throws in some mechanics to help you really connect with the characters beyond just going over a "progression" checklist, such as the camp, where you can talk to your party and find out what they're thinking or how they're feeling about a certain point in the story — something that's common in certain Western RPGs but not so much in JRPGs of that time. Each character is deep and complex enough to feel authentic; they fit into their own archetypes but don't get boxed in by them, and those campfire chats really add to their charm and individuality.

Leaving the narrative part for a moment but still sticking to the story, it's worth highlighting Breath of Fire IV's world-building, which, despite not being the focus, still has enough detail to make anyone curious. I'd definitely like to know more about the world bathed in a sea of mud, where the salty ocean's just scraps of water scattered across the globe; or perhaps more about the first gods summoned to this world and their purpose; or even more details about the history of the Fou empire itself (which clearly takes some inspiration from Chinese culture) and what its reality was like before unification.

Breath of Fire IV is my favorite of the series, one that delivers the most in terms of story and immersion, something I value a lot in RPGs. I hope that everyone who has the opportunity to play this game (thanks {% rauserpic Searo %} for the great set) will have the same feeling... tight lines, I mean, good game

For my Play This Set, I'd like to blab about Pikmin and by extension Pikmin 2, which operates on most of the groundwork that Pikmin 1 does with some slight tweaks to things.

Pikmin is an interesting game to discuss, both from the ongoing perspective of those foreign to the series and those who aren't. The collective consciousness seems to deem Pikmin as a "calming farming-esque game", which I can only assume is because of the cute mascot creatures on the covers with flowers on their heads, when the core theme around the entire series is survival and how that embodies different scenarios and goals of survival, including the moment-to-moment gameplay. Pikmin 1 stars Captain Olimar who crash-lands on a planet with poisonous oxygen, no way to return to orbit, and a life system that lasts for 30 days. He discovers the Pikmin and uses them to recollect his missing ship parts, hoping to do so before the 30-day time limit eventually claims his life. The Pikmin embody the bottom of the food chain; they have no great power individually and are frequently preyed upon by close to every living creature. Only through Olimar's command can they become a deadly force through swarm tactics, careful evasion, and throws. At its core, it's a Real Time Strategy game with an emphasis on traversal through a hostile environment and weighing your options against a constantly ticking timer, whether that's prioritizing safety at the cost of time or more risky plays to maximize efficiency.

It's also not a difficult game or complicated RTS, as you can very comfortably beat it only getting one part each day, though there is incentive to fine-tune your tactics and efficiency to complete the game in a minimum amount of days. The core achievement set asks you to beat the game in or under 12 days, and a bonus set for beating the game in 6, where you get every single part in each area in a single day (barring the tutorial). There is also a challenge mode, which tasks you to get as many Pikmin as possible in each of the games' levels, though getting a perfect score is likely not intended by the developers and requires near literal machine precision to get. Pikmin 2 has the same style of gameplay, introduces two new Pikmin types, but does away with the day limit (and subsequently a hard-end game over that requires a full restart) and focuses more on treasure hunting and exploring caves. It goes up the hierarchy of needs from surviving to keep living to surviving to keep your job. Neither game is particularly long, but both embody specific feelings that I fail to see reflected in many other games for multiple reasons.

The most prominent draw of Pikmin is its world, which does wonders at making it come off as a living, breathing ecosystem. Enemies are animalistic in nature and have territories, some more varied than others, but come off more naturally than just being an enemy in a room. They don't respawn immediately on the start of a new day, some appearing only on specific days, and the threat of Pikmin not within your squad or near base are at risk of being consumed by the nocturnal creatures by nightfall. It helps build the feeling that they are living creatures, with those that respawn being new animals who migrated into the empty territory whose previous owner was removed. Pikmin might be at the bottom, but they make use of all other animals above them to propagate their species, much like how our real food chain has animals feast on vegetation but at the end of their life feed back into the soil. Pikmin 2 even has a database of all animals and plants encountered during gameplay, where Olimar writes a log about their features and involvement in their ecosystem.

Pikmin also scratches a specific itch that I can only describe as the "scavenging genre". Somewhat similar to collectathons, though rather than collecting a level-focused collectible like a star or shine sprite, it's random junk found in your pocket and in the dusty corner of the room. Of this vague genre, I could name Thief, Escape from Tarkov, and the odd survival game like Abiotic Factor. Scavenging isn't the core identity of these games, but it is an element that I feel has a strong enough presence to denote mention. Pikmin 1 and 2 do have unique collectibles through 1's Ship Parts and 2's Treasures, though I find it's through the varied types of random things you get that makes it stray away a slight bit from the general vibe of collectathon games, as well as collecting types of enemies to grow your Pikmin numbers. It reaches its fingers into the crevices in my brain and gives it a good scratch being able to take a look at my varied bounty of stuff and see what characters think of it.

Shigeru Miyamoto stated how he wanted Pikmin to be a household name like Mario, though I feel that its lack of "immediate ease of access" (both in regards to its style of gameplay and the setting not being as easily transferable into other scenarios) is what will keep it from being as globally renowned, but it's also what helps give it its identity. There isn't any other game like Pikmin (though some have focused on some elements akin to Pikmin and I adore them, they're just not the same in the specific feeling it brings) and that's the strongest incentive I can give to anyone who wants to experience either game on GameCube. It's a lovely series that I'm happy exists as it does, and I can only wish that others who play see it the same way.

The granddaddy and [very first true 3D game ever made](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-platformer-in-true-3d), Jumping Flash is a really fun and relatively simple game where you play in first person and can jump and shoot! The objective is simply to just gather all the EXIT Muu's in the level and step on the exit pad. There's also a boss at the end of every world you'll have to deal with, so it's a bit standard. However, I find that it holds up extremely well, as the platforming is really tight and fun thanks to having a double jump and the fact that you look straight down while you're falling down. Combined with a shadow, I had no troubles at all with depth perception in the game and, despite it being the first of its kind, still fixes a problem games like that have to this day.

The set itself is also really fun, and encourages you to play every element of the game. Yes, it does have the ever divisive "no damage boss" runs, but the bosses are all relatively simple, you can use power-ups from previous stages and it still counts, AND once you beat a boss you can do a fast retry. The final two bosses were tough but if I can do it then anyone can with a little practice! There's also a couple of time attack achievements but there's room for error, and it's not every single level, so it's very doable!

Overall it's an excellent set for an equally interesting game that honestly I think should get more attention especially for how it's a historical landmark, being the first true 3D game and all. It's an overlooked gem in favor of other early 3D games such as [Mario 64](https://retroachievements.org/game/10003), but this game holds up well and, if I may make a hot take, holds up better than Mario 64! If you haven't tried it, this game is worth a shot, and I have fond memories of it here at RA since it was one of the first games I'd ever mastered!

Though the PS1 might be less famous for its FPS output than the N64, it still had a bunch of interesting games in that genre. Among those games is [Insomniac](https://retroachievements.org/game/843)'s debut game, Disruptor, a fantastic [Doom](https://retroachievements.org/game/8101) clone that might have been a little late to the party in a rapidly evolving industry, but today is a fascinating game that oozes of the 90's in the best possible way.

Told through wonderfully cheesy FMV cutscenes, the story does a good enough job to give context to what you are doing. It provides the narrative drive that pushes you to jump from one level to the next across the galaxy. From techno corridors to foggy open spaces, the levels are a nice balance of frenetic action and exploration. With hints of Starship Trooper in its storytelling, the journey of Jack Curtis, top recruit from the academy, climbing through the ranks of the military will see him gain a whole suite of new powers, called psions, that add variety to the gameplay by offering more options than just your typical weapon arsenal.

It might take some time to really gel with the movement if you are not used to tank controls. Juggling with all the weapons and powers is no easy task on a PS1 pad, but sticking with it will reward you with some great 90's sci-fi schlock and a really fun and well paced game from a team that will move on to make [Spyro](https://retroachievements.org/game/11279) and [Ratchet & Clank](https://retroachievements.org/game/3070).
