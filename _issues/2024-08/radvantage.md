| {% raachpic 181117, 201697, Angry Wings %} | Get the Profit Bird twice in one Run. | 4      |

On the surface this seems like an easy-peasy achievement, I mean, it's only 4 points.
And it is, but without the strat I will lay upon you, you will be grinding this for longer than you would want. So, what you're gonna do is equip the Free Ride gadget. Crash your vehicle and die over and over until you get the profit bird. Now, you're gonna want to crash the bird on the first obstacle, should appear around 115-140 meters. Continue playing until you find another Ride box. Pick it up and see what it is. If it isn't the bird, press start and then Square to retry the run. You will notice that your free ride will still be the bird, however, because you picked up the second box, the next box you will see will have a different vehicle. So you just retry this method until the second box also has the bird. It's essentially like jamming one reel of a slot machine and spinning the other 2 until they land on triple.
