To defeat a bird, spray it until it drops a coin. The birds fly all through Delfino Plaza, so just keep exploring until you find and defeat them all. There are a few different groups of birds, and each group follows a specific pattern.

| {% raachpic 395109, 446617, Pianta Paradox (10) %} | Obtain a Blue Coin from the Pianta with mushrooms on his back on your first visit to Delfino Plaza |


**Missable**: This can be missed if you reveal the entrance to Bianco Hills before obtaining the Blue Coin.

This is meant to be obtained later in the game once the Pianta catches on fire. Thanks to what is likely an oversight, we can profit earlier than intended! Spread some goop to the Pianta's path by sliding. After the Pianta is submerged, spray him clean and talk to him.

A Chuckster becomes enraged when you step on top of them. This is used to force them to face the direction that you want them to throw Mario in. However, Mario is an upstanding individual who is trying to recover his reputation, so let's be nice.
