When the original Xbox came out I was a diehard Sony fan, but for some reason I got it in my head that I needed the new Xbox that was coming out. I ended up being a first day owner of the system (the only system that has ever happened for). This was going to be my Christmas present but I got it months early so I could use it. This is a selection of games I think show why the system was special along with some guilty pleasure games that maybe don't hold up.

## 1. Fusion Frenzy

Microsoft's answer to the Mario party series. While not as good as the best of the Mario party series it holds its own with fun minigames!

## 2. Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge

A great aerial combat game and my first exposure to what online play with a console could look like. Just a fast paced flight shooter done well!

## 3. Star Wars: Obi-Wan

This was the second game I owned for the system after Halo. As a big star wars fan, having all the unique star wars experiences is a must. This game takes place around the time of the phantom menace with you playing as Obi-Wan. While it isn't the best star wars game it is still fun.

## 4. Steel Battalion

This is a game that I would mainly like to see a set for to see how it could be emulated. Do you just have all of your keyboard buttons mapped to different buttons on the giant controller?

## 5. NightCaster

This is an action adventure game where the main gimmick is elemental magic that is used against enemies of opposing elements. This is a gimmick that I have always thought was fun and the execution here was my first experience to this type of gameplay.

## 6. Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes

Some of the most fun I have ever had with couch co-op are from this game. I usually have fun with dungeons and dragons games anyways and this one is no exception.

## 7. Panzer Dragoon Orta

I never owned this game and I didn't learn about it until the price was too much to justify the purchase. I have only heard great things and would love to have the opportunity to play it and earn some achievements!

## 8. Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus

This game has combat damage to fighters and always seemed ahead of its time to me when I would play it.

## 9. Hunter: The Reckoning - Redeemer

Based in the World of Darkness universe (Werewolf, Vampire). There is a first Hunter the reckoning also for Xbox but that was multi system and I have no idea which version is better. This was only on the OG Xbox and is a fun hack and slash themed in a world I like!

## 10. Azurik: Rise of Perathia

Another elemental based action adventure game. This time you are able to mix and match elements to create new effects. A set using different elemental combinations would be really cool to see.
