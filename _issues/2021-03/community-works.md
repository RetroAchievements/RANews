Some cool works being done by the RetroAchievements fans.

## RAPodcast

In the last month the guys behind the official RetroAchievements Podcast released one new episode:

- [RAPodcast Episode 17 - RARoundtable #2](https://youtu.be/0mMUOCUEq3c)
- [RAPodcast Episode 18 - Pulse_XP](https://youtu.be/dcESUWJXDQA)

Kudos to {% rauser Draco655 %}, {% rauser Shootzy %} and {% rauser KingS1zzle %} to keep this running.


## RetroBattle

{% rauser Thoreau %} has been hosting battles where the participants compete to win several challenges. Each battle is focused in only one game.

Here's a list of the previous battles:

- [Retrobattle #6 - Mega Man](https://youtu.be/vYyhL0nyVAU)
- [Retrobattle #7 - Sonic](https://youtu.be/I4lqynpl-Xw)
