## Intro

:no_entry: **\*\* NOTE: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FOR SOLVING ACHIEVEMENT PUZZLES \*\*** :no_entry:

Spoiler solutions for the boss strategies and a potential order to earning the achievements will be hidden in a collapsible entry that you must click to expand so that only the solutions you need assistance with will be viewable. Some of the more minor achievements will have strategies written outright without a collapsible dropdown so use the guide at your own risk.

Names of characters, places, etc. used in this guide are based off of the [Namingway Edition romhack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2337/), which is an update of the Final Fantasy II (US) ROM to bring it closer to Final Fantasy IV (J). The hack brings the names of people, places, items, etc. are as close as possible to the current naming conventions used by Square Enix in modern re-releases of this game.

The [Namingway Edition romhack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2337/) is **THE** recommended way to play the game for these achievements as one or two of them seem to be designed with this particular romhack in mind (in particular, the [Salve of Salvation](http://retroachievements.org/achievement/108663) achievement).

## About

This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a simple guide for the current achievement set available on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/3528). This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility, and any other necessary or useful information.

## Introduction

Final Fantasy IV is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Famicom. Released in Japan in 1991, it is the fourth installment in the Final Fantasy series. This game features a more story-driven approach (a la Final Fantasy II), centered around the dark knight Cecil. However, many of the mechanics introduced in Final Fantasy III make their return here: character job classes (though they are fixed for the most part), the Fat Chocobo, many vehicle options, graphic designs, and some dungeons that require specific mechanics to traverse. The similarities to Final Fantasy III are probably due to the game being initially designed for the Famicom/NES [(source)](https://web.archive.org/web/20161216181140/http://matotree.com/2012/08/final-fantasy-iv-for-the-famicom-was-80-complete/).

With the focus on plot, Final Fantasy IV will push you into situations that can lock you out of areas, characters, and abilities as you progress. As a result, many achievements for this game will become missable if you are not diligent. However, all achievements can be earned in one playthrough. This guide will attempt to help you in identifying the missable achievements if you'd rather not play this fantastic, but lengthy, game multiple times.

## Trivia

- This achievement set, created by [MrGauss](http://retroachievements.org/User/MrGauss), uses lines from Dante's Divine Comedy for the story achievements. The demons known as "Malebranches" in the Divine Comedy are the inspiration for the Four Arch-Fiends.
- Final Fantasy IV has had numerous ports and remakes. Notoriously, the US version released on the Super NES was censored and made easier for the American market. In Japan, Square re-released Final Fantasy IV on the Super Famicom, called "Final Fantasy IV Easy Type". Many refer to "Easy Type" as the US version, but it is actually another iteration that builds off the US Version. You can read more about the many versions for the SNES/Super Famicom [here](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV_version_differences), as well as all of the numerous other ports and their differences.
- A sequel game was developed for Japanese mobile phones, subtitled "The After Years". This game was eventually ported and released worldwide on the WiiWare service of the Nintendo Wii system and also experienced it's own share of ports and remakes.
- A 3D remake was released on the 3DS, similar in appearance to the Final Fantasy III remake and made by the same studio, Matrix Software.

## Save Support

The game uses a battery to save game data across four slots. Players can save the game at any time while on the overworld map or in certain safe spots in dungeons to any one of the slots.

## Leaderboards

There are two leaderboards currently associated with the game.

- [Game Speed Run](http://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=8113) - The fastest time needed to finish the game
- [Sum of party level](http://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=8114) - The lowest level of all characters at game's end

## Achievements

There are a total of 130 achievements, which can be broken down into the following categories:

- **Story**: 14 achievements earned naturally through the course of gameplay
- **Summons**: 4 achievements related to summons for Rydia earned by going to out-of-the-way locations (**1 is missable**)
- **Boss Challenge**: 18 achievements (**17 are missable**) that require special action during boss fights by the player to successfully earn the achievement
- **Commands**: 24 achievements (**15 are missable**) that require use of the special commands of characters in certain situations or completion of a specific objective in one gameplay session
- **Treasure**: 33 achievements (**4 are missable**) which require finding all treasure, including hidden items, in a specified location
- **Dancer**: 8 achievements which require talking to specific NPCs
- **Chicobo Quest**: 15 achievements which require you to find a specific, out-of-the-way, location hinted in the achievement description and pressing the [Y] button.
- **Endgame Items**: 3 achievements (**1 is marked as missable for it's difficulty**) for items which are earned by events and grinding
- **Miscellaneous**: 11 achievements (**1 is missable**) that don't fit in the above categories, including 2 related to a specific endgame item to help avoid missing it
- Out of all of the achievements, **39 are missable**

## Potential Order

The following is a breakdown of the order of achievements based on my personal playthrough. Note that your mileage may vary due to the path you may desire to take, such as getting Odin before going to the Moon.

Each section is grouped under story achievements and hidden under a dropdown to avoid spoilers. If you want to see the achievements, **click on the arrow** next to each section to reveal the table. I have call outs to sections where a grind may be appropriate for the three grind achievements. If you want to see the entire thing, [click here!](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki/Final-Fantasy-IV-Achievement-Order)

:no_entry: **MINOR SPOILER SECTION** :no_entry:

The tables only reveal when achievements can be earned and possibly missed. No strategies on earning the achievements are provided here, just the order I earned them in.

### The Departure âž¡ A Heart's Resolve

**Grind alert!** Goblins in the overworld very rarely drop their eponymous summon. The only other Goblin type that drops the summon is in the Lunar Subterrane with the same drop rate.

### Savior of Mist âž¡ Pride of Fabul

**Grind alert!** Balloons in the Tower of Babil can very rarely drop their eponymous summon. You can also get it from them and the Grenades on the Moon later, if you'd rather wait, since the drop rate is low.

### Forever Loved âž¡ Mysidian Legend

**NOTE:** Elemental Cure is broken. It triggers when a FellKnight uses Absorb in the Defender Sword Monster-in-a-Box fight. It should be available to earn when a character has a Cursed Ring with an elemental reducing armor equipped. It isn't too big of a deal that this one achievement out of 130 pops early, given that you still need to grind for a Cursed Ring anyway... ðŸ˜‰

**Grind alert!** If you didn't get the Bomb summon earlier, grinding Balloons and Grenades in the Lunar Path caverns or the Moon overworld may be the next best opportunity.

### To the Dark Depths âž¡ Life's Triumph

**Grind alert!** If you don't have the remaining summon items, now is the time to get them. You will also be grinding for Pink Tail(s) in the Lunar Subterrane, and the Cursed Ring from the Souls and Spirits at Mt. Ordeals if you didn't get that earlier.

The final boss must be fought more than once to complete the set. I would think it may be best to beat the game with the full party first, reload the save, then grind to get Cecil ready for the final fight...

Special call out: The incredibly grind heavy Evil Jewelry, Summoning Mastery, and One of a Kind. They are not included in the order list above because of the rare drops involved in their achievements: 1/64 chance for the applicable item IF an item drops from the monster. See the Grind section below for strategies on how to complete the grind.

## Story

No discussion on the story achievements here as you simply need to play through the game to earn them. You can't miss them!

## Summons

The three non-missable summons achievements are standard boss fights with no special requirements for boss challenge achievements. Therefore, have fun with these fights and experiment on your own or refer to your favorite strategy guide/GameFAQ for details.

The only missable achievement in this section is [Loyal Friend](http://retroachievements.org/achievement/108637). **It is only available between when Kain leaves the group before going to the Moon!** When the opportunity presents itself to go to the Moon, it would be wise to fully explore the world to wrap up any loose ends before departing.

- Find Yang in the Sylphs' Cave
- Go to Fabul to see Sheila and get the Frying Pan
- Go back to Sylphs' Cave and use the Frying Pan on Yang.

This series of steps is also closely related to the [Bull's Eye](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108675) achievement and why that is also marked as missable.


## Boss Challenge

:no_entry: **HERE, THERE BE SPOILERS!** :no_entry:

This is where the meat of the achievement set is at! If you wish to challenge yourself, I recommend not expanding the strategies I used to complete these fun and puzzling achievements. Make use of nearby save spots where possible and experiment with the skills and items you have to complete these very awesome challenges!

- [![Mist dragon](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109793.png "The Steel and the Mist")](http://retroachievements.org/achievement/108640) - [The Steel and the Mist](http://retroachievements.org/achievement/108640):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Don't attack while she is in Mist form, only while in Dragon form. Take a couple of rounds of attacks for both Kain and Cecil and then wait for it to change forms. Repeat until dead. Use mist form rounds for healing if necessary. </details>
- [![Soldier with a sword](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109814.png "No Messengers Left")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108641) - [No Messengers Left](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108641):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Take out two guards, then concentrate on the General. Killing all three guards first will result in the General fleeing the battle. </details>
- [![Giant squid with an evil toothy smile](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109818.png "Tako Express")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108642) - [Tako Express](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108642):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>This is your first test of speed and strength. I recommend lowering the battle speed to 6 in order to give your characters more chances to attack. If you are still having trouble defeating Octomamm with a large enough hit to kill him before he goes to one leg remaining, you may need to grind a bit for levels to raise your base strength. </details>
- [![An insectoid monster with bug eyes and gaping toothy mouth](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/110965.png "Reactionless Jaws")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108643) - [Reactionless Jaws](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108643):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>_Unfortunately, I didn't keep notes on this fight and don't have a save nearby to verify my memory here..._ Don't physically attack! Using Cecil's Dark is key, since that is not a physical attack and doesn't consume MP. Keep Cecil's health up with potions from Edward and Rydia. Another possibility is to have Edward Sing and hope that it causes the Charm status effect so that the Antlion attacks itself. </details>
- [![Large red bomb-type monster](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/111289.png "Explosive Sync")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108644) - [Explosive Sync](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108644):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>When Mom Bomb grows full size, cease attacks. A party member will say, "It's gonna blow!". As it explodes and begins to split into the six bombs, use a Silk Web item to slow the bombs immediately. Have Yang use Kick to knock down the health of all the bombs slightly. Now cycle to Edward and have him attack each blue bomb individually to get their health in range, hopefully without critical hits. Once all three blue bombs were attacked without dying, a single Dark command from Cecil should take them all out in one shot and the achievement will be awarded. </details>
- [![Horned zombie demon](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113138.png "Malebranche of Earth")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108645) - [Malebranche of Earth](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108645):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Use Palom's Boost command until maxed out (6 times?). Then have Palom cast Fira on Scarmiglione. This will meet the requirement of taking out the boss with only one action **on him!** My Palom was Level 19 when I got this achievement. </details>
- [![Serpent faced humanoid with snakes for hands](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113431.png "Minimalist Struggle")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108646) - [Minimalist Struggle](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108646):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Note that party members can die but must be alive before the battle ends! Make sure to save in the Ancient Waterway. Have Tellah cast Mini on your party prior to entering the central hall of Baron Castle. Since you are Mini, Palom cannot use his Boast command to strengthen his spells. Palom should use his strongest spells: Quake, or Bio if Quake isn't available yet. I recommend getting Quake unlocked in the Ancient Waterway if you don't have it though. Buff your party with Tellah and Porom casting Blink to avoid taking too much damage. Since Baigan's body counters spells with Reflect, use low level spells on his body to wear off the effect. I used Cure twice on him to bounce a healing spell back at my party while wearing off his Reflect. It can take two hits before the Reflect wears off. Once it does, use Quake again to win. </details>
- [![Turtle demon surrounded by raging waters](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113433.png "Malebranche of Water")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108647) - [Malebranche of Water](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108647):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>No one can die this time around. Since you just fought Baigan, it would be wise to return to the Ancient Waterway to save your game again. You can use a Tent here or use Cecil's bed to heal up as well. If you have your battle speed at or near "1", you may want to lower it. I found that Cagnazzo is too quick and fires off Haste before Tellah is even able to cast a spell when the battle speed was at "1". Once I lowered the speed down to "6", this challenge was in the bag. Have Palom cast Bio and Tellah cast Thundaga, skipping everyone else. Those two spells should put Cagnazzo inside his shell before he casts Haste if it doesn't kill him outright. Cast one more Bio or Thundara/Thundaga to finish up the fight. </details>
- [![Squat, yet long limbed, creature with long hair and a horn](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117082.png "Winds of Victory")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108648) - [Winds of Victory](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108648):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Only the Dark Dragon phase of this fight matters for the achievement. Dark Dragon is susceptible to Tornado (hence the name of the achievement). Care must be taken to not have actions queued when the Dark Elf changes into the Dark Dragon as any extra actions taken will invalidate the achievement. In my many attempts, I found that my party took 10 attack actions on the Dark Elf before it changed. Your party levels may be different though so use caution around 7-8 attacks on the Elf. Once it does change, use Tornado and then follow with an attack from any other character. Do note though that Tornado still has a chance to fail. If it does fail, it still counts as an action on the boss and thus a reset is required. It can be annoying to reset and then deal with the story stuff and equipment changes but fast-forward is your friend... </details>
- [![Three women: one tall with a spear and one short with a knife](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117122.png "Magical Miscalculation")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108649) - [Magical Miscalculation](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108649):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Some have talked about Tellah having Dispel and using that to cancel out the Reflect status on Cindy; however, my Tellah did not have Dispel. I also saw people talk about casting Silence on Sandy so that she can't cast Reflect. I was never able to get Silence to stick though. So, I attacked Cindy until her health was low, doing approximately 4000 HP of damage. Note that Cid's Study and Libra spells don't work, so you'll have to keep track of the damage dealt in your head. When you think you are close, kill Sandy. While Cid, Yang, and Cecil attack Sandy, have Tellah cast Cura on Cindy to try to wear down her Reflect status. I found that when Sandy puts Reflect on Cindy, the status will stay on just until I have killed Sandy, which will then expose Cindy to Mindy's spells. If you time it right and have Cindy's health low enough, Mindy will end up killing Cindy and the achievement will pop. There may be better ways to do this, but this is the process that worked for me. Make sure you save right after this fight since another boss challenge follows shortly after this! </details>
- [![Woman with long hair wrapped around her like a whirlwind](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117137.png "Malebranche of Wind")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108650) - [Malebranche of Wind](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108650):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Yang's Focus will be the primary damage dealer since you can't use Kain's Jump to break up Barbariccia's whirlwind form. Focus will ignore the defense of the whirlwind. So, focus your efforts on keeping everyone alive and not fully petrifying. Cecil and Rosa can provide healing and Esunas. Cid and Kain can use Gold Needles and healing potions. There is some luck involved in this with Barbariccia's Tornados landing their hit or not. If the Tornado does connect, heal that character immediately (Yang should still Focus though). If Barbariccia does her follow up physical attack on the tornado'd character, they'll die. You may benefit from lowering your battle speed on this fight. Barbariccia's Ray does gradual petrification. So you have a few rounds before you need to cure the effect. You'll know it is close when the character looks like they are fully stone but still standing and able to act. If Gold Needles are running low, take a chance and only recover the debuff when they look like they are fully grey. Do note that Ray cast on the same character multiple times speeds this up. If a character gets hit by Ray twice in a row, focus on curing the affected person. </details>
- [![Large and creepy doll with crown and hair in pigtails](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117225.png "Danse Macabre")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108651) - [Danse Macabre](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108651):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>For every Calca doll taken down, a Brina doll must also fall. Attack on Brina doll, then kill one Calca. Continue attacking the dolls in pairs like that. When there is only one pair remaining, the Brina doll is weaker so that should be the last doll standing. Concentrate attacks on the last Calca doll and all attacks will then shift to the final Brina, which should fall quickly before it can change to Calcabrina. </details>
- [![A small person pilots a giant humanoid robot](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117412.png "Clockwork Destruction")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108652) - [Clockwork Destruction](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108652):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>The first phase of the fight, when Dr. Lugae and Baranab are separate, use Haste spells and Hermes items to speed up the entire party. Attack Baranb until it falls. Bring up Yang's menu. As soon as Dr. Lugae talks about taking manual contrl, select the Focus command. Have the next character use a Silk Web item or cast Slow on Barnab-Z. Now have everyone attack. I managed to get lucky on my attempt and Rosa did a critical hit with Aim, followed by Yang's standard attack killing Barnab-Z. I think even without the crit, I was on track to beating out Baranb-Z's explosion with everyone attacking, Rosa Aiming, and Rydia casting Thundara. </details>
- [![Red faced demon draped in red and blue cape with hand extended](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117556.png "Malebranche of Fire")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108653) - [Malebranche of Fire](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108653):
  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Perhaps the toughest challenge?? Rosa needs to know Reflect, which she learns at level 36. This fight is a matter of timing. Since you cannot target Rubicante directly, you will need to set Reflect on a party member and then have Rydia bounce Blizzara off that character. This will take about 11 hits to accomplish (my Rydia at level 36 required that many hits). Rubicante's pattern: opens his cloak and uses his Scorch technique, closes his cloak, physically attacks one or two characters, and repeats. Rosa should cast Reflect on a surviving party member after Rubicante's physical attacks, which should be cast before he opens his cloak. Ensure Rydia is ready to cast as soon as Rubicante opens his cloak, then select the Blizzara spell and target your party member that has the Reflect status. This should hit Rubicante before he uses Scorch. If Rubicante Scorches, he will close his cloak immediately after, so it is very important to cast Blizzara as he opens his cloak or you will miss. Contingencies will be needed as party members are attacked and die. Edge, Cecil, and Kain should be using Phoenix Downs to revive characters. If Rosa or Rydia are taken out, you may miss a cycle. Take time to breathe and think through every action. I found this challenge to be very intense because of the concentration needed and finding the rhythm. It was very satisfying to accomplish! In my first attempt at this, I didn't have nearly enough Phoenix Downs and needed to leave the Tower of Babil to stock back up. In my second attempt, I was trying to keep people healed with Cecil's Cura or Hi-Potions, but found that would cause problems with the cycle so I only focused on raising dead party members. Keeping people alive increases targets for Rubicante's attacks and thus less chance of targeting Rydia or Rosa. Of course, balance is key. If you can't get back into a cycle because he keeps taking out your party, take some rounds to restore with stronger spells or items and then get back into the rhythm again. Good luck!! </details>

  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>After the final save point in the Sealed Cave, there is one more TrapDoor to face before entering the Crystal Chamber. You may want to defeat the door before setting yourself up for this fight and possibly go back up to the save point, just in case. Set battle mode to Active and lower battle speed AND battle message to 6. Active is required for the achievement and a speed of 6 will give you more time to react. If you cleared out the Sylph Cave prior to going to the Sealed Cave, the Avenger Sword can be beneficial. Use a Silk Web or cast Slow to slow down the Demon Wall, use Bacchus Wines or cast Berzerk on your front line, and have Rydia summon Leviathan. The Silk Web will cause Demon Wall to retaliate with a gradual petrification spell, but you can ignore it since you will beat the boss before that takes full effect. Characters won't be able to do anything until the wall has already moved two times and probably won't make their first actions after the third movement. I tried this a few times, changing the battle speed to see when I can get my party to act sooner, but a speed of 6 for both battle speed and message was key. Additionally, I got good damage rolls from Rydia's Leviathan and a crit from Edge, so luck may play a part in this. I also moved items and spells around in order to put them where the cursor appears in the menu to speed up my actions. Another possibility could be to Haste party members, especially the one with the Avenger Sword or Rydia (but I haven't tried this...). </details>

Fusoya's Bless keeps health bumped up with Rosa supplementing healing. Rosa should focus on anyone who get's dangerously close to low health (especially Edge). Use Rydia's opposing third level elemental spell or Bahamut if you have him at this point, Haste Cecil and have him attack, use Edge's opposing elemental Ninjutsu as appropriate also. </details>

  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>The order to take down the nodes is Defense, CPU, Attack. If the Defense and Attack nodes are killed before the CPU, you will lose this challenge. So, the biggest concern is accidentally killing the Attack node before the CPU is defeated. Since the CPU casts Reflect on itself, you have no choice but to physically attack it. Have Fusoya keep your health up with Bless to negate the Attack node's paltry attack beams and keep on attacking the CPU. Once that is down, kill the Attack node and the achievement will pop! </details>

  - <details><summary>Strategy</summary>This should be easy enough if you have been grinding for the Adamant Armor. Have a healthy stack of Elixirs available as well, which you should have enough money to buy a bunch from the Flan Princess fights. When the battle with Zeromus begins and everyone is revived by your friends, kill them off again before using the Crystal. With the final battle now beginning, switch between attacks and using Elixirs. You may have some opportunities to get two attacks in, depending on if Zeromus used Flare, Meteor, or Holy on you successfully. You should have too much difficulty with this at this point though, if you have been working on getting everything you need for all of the achievements in one playthrough. Do note though that you will have to fight Zeromus twice in order to get this achievement as well as Shadow Hands. I opted for Shadow Hands first and then followed up with Cosmic Duel. </details>

## Commands

The intent of these achievements is to showcase the utility of the character's various special abilities, as they were not present in the original US release. They provide a great preview of how they work and their nessecity in completing some of the boss challenge achievements. It is recommended trying to get these achievements as soon as the necessary character joins your party, because a lot of them are missable.

## Treasure

There are **four** locations that are missable: Tower of Zot, Tower of Babil first visit, Tower of Babil second visit, and Giant of Babil.

I am not going into details on treasure locations since there are a ton of pre-existing resources out there that map the locations of every treasure and hidden item in the game. I made use of mostly excellent maps at [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588330-final-fantasy-iv/faqs) to get all of these achievements.

Some minor notes:

From the beginning of the game, you can start on the Chocobo Forest Treasure Hunter achievement. Don't forget to grab the Gyshal Green in the grass of every Chocobo Forest.

The Chocobo Village has two Gyshal Greens hidden in grass on the far right. There is a path through the trees by the "back of the head" of the Chocobo.

A chest with 1000 gil in Kokkol's Forge is hidden to the right of the stairs going to the second floor.

## Dancer

Talk to every NPC in towns to ensure you get these. Since none are missable, I won't go into detail here on where to find them. The dancer in Fabul Castle is VERY close to the King's bedroom though, so that is the perfect opportunity to get the [Regal Rest](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108729) achievement as well!

## Chicobo Quest

The achievement set creator, [MrGauss](http://retroachievements.org/User/MrGauss), made great descriptions that help to hint at the correct location. However, they also provided close up images of the badges for the Chicobo Quest achievements if the image in the locked achievement is too blurry. These can help in finding the correct location to stand and press the "Y" button on your controller.

## The Grind

**Setup:** When I do grinding for achievements, I make good use of the tools at my disposal to make the grind a bit easier and more comfortable. Since this is a Super NES game, I make use of the triggers (or L2/R2) to do fast-forward toggling. If I want to speed up the action, I hold down the trigger to activate fast-forward. For extended grinding sessions, rather than hold the trigger, I keep fast-forward active (using the '-' key on the keyboard) and then my trigger is used to temporarily turn off fast-forward until I let go.

In the late game, grinds can be done easily by quickly moving left and right (or up and down) in the area where the desired encounters are and hold down the "B" button to run. When the battle starts, I let go of "B" and hold down the "A" button so that everyone attacks. When the battle ends, I make sure to continue to hold down "A" through the item menu if it appears. If you switch back to the "B" button, you could lose the item!

In all item grinds, quantity of the desired enemy matters. Every enemy instance has a chance to drop an item and then if they drop they have a 1/64 chance of dropping the required item for the grind. For example, three Spirits and a Soul in one battle will provide a greater chance at dropping a Cursed Ring rather than one Dinozombie.

[![Ring topped with jeweled skull emitting evil aura](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118270.png "Evil Jewelry")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108718) [Evil Jewelry](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108718): A great time to initially grind for this item would be right after Cecil becomes a paladin. To support this, purchase the armor for a paladin (Light Shield, Light Helm, Knight Armor, and Gauntlet) from Mysidia before going to Mt. Ordeals. Since Cecil is level 1 when he becomes a paladin, you can now grind for levels for him as well as attempting to get the Cursed Ring from the Souls and Spirits on Mt. Ordeals. Once Cecil class changes, go down to the base of the mountain and look for Souls and Spirits to grind on. There is a group of three Spirits and one Soul that is perfect. Make use of **Twincasting** with the Twins to speed up the battles! If you need to heal, you can run out of Mt. Ordeals to the Chocobo Forest to the south and restore your MP at the White Chocobo. If you don't find a Cursed Ring by the time Cecil reaches level 20, then it may be better to wait until later to get it. I personally didn't get the Cursed Ring until the end game, having to grind at Mt. Ordeals while watching Twitch so that I wouldn't get board and leaving the game on fast-forward the entire time. Do note that the achievement pops as soon as you win the battle, since the item drops are determined at that time.

[![An open book with a bubble containing fire floating over it](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118132.png "Summoning Mastery")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108681) [Summoning Mastery](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108681): There are four monster summons you can get as very rare item drops: Goblin, Bomb, Mindflayer, and Cockatrice. See the below chart for enemies and locations to grind for the drop:

|   Spell    | Monster                      | Location                                  |
| :--------: | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
|   Goblin   | Goblin, Li'l Killer/Murderer | Outside Baron, around Mt.Hobs/Antlion Den |
|    Bomb    | Grenade, Balloon             | Lunar Surface                             |
| Mindflayer | Mindflayer                   | Magnetic Cavern                           |
| Cockatrice | Cockatrice                   | Around and outside of Mt. Hobs            |

[![A glittering armored breastplate](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118808.png "One of a Kind")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108720) [One of a Kind](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108720): This is the grind that most people think of when it comes to Final Fantasy IV. Getting the Pink Tail actually isn't as bad as it could be, if you are prepared. This achievement set actually provides a couple of achievements to aid you in this grind: [Alert!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108732) and [Avatar of Patience](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108733).

The Alert! achievement is designed to let you know the ideal area to grind for the Siren item: the Giant of Babil's head. While this is a great location to grind for experience, you don't actually need to grind for the Siren items from the Searcher enemy. That's because Sirens are for sale in the Hummingway Haven on the Moon if you are playing the Namingway Edition patch, like you should be. If you do want to get Sirens from the Searchers, kill off your party except for Edge and steal the item from the Searchers over and over again.

 The Avatar of Patience achievement tells you the room to use the Sirens in when you explore the Lunar Subterrane. Using a Siren in this room will make a group of five dancing Pink Flans appear. This fight can be difficult if your party is weak and Cecil doesn't have his Crystal gear or the Ribbons for Rydia and Rosa. Pink Flans can be killed easily with a couple Bahamut summons or just attacks if your party is at a high enough level. Just take care to heal. A lot of progress can be lost with a party wipe.

Once you **finally** have a Pink Tail, return to Earth and give the item to the tail collector in the Adamant Grotto.

The intended method of getting this is to wear the Cursed Ring with armor that has elemental resistances, such as the Adamant Armor. This causes the armor to absorb the element rather than reduce the damage. |
