Hello all and welcome to This Month in Retro! After two console launch months and a break, we return to 1994 where we... funnily enough have another console launch! Though this time I won't dedicate the entire article to said console since it was the PlayStation 1 in Japan. As big as PlayStation is now, people at the time were still uncertain what this completely new company would bring to the table, resulting in a launch line-up that is better left forgotten. Most of it was just Mahjong and Shogi after all. My original plan was actually to have a Christmas-themed TMIR, but there wasn't a single Christmas-themed game released this month soo... we have a very normal month to look at. A very tame month even, since November 1994 was absolutely nuts when it came to game releases, so they cooled down a bit to prepare for the year after. Except for in Japan where they still continued to pump out absolute bangers, and this month is especially special for me in that regard. Why? Well, find out when you reach the Japanese side of today's This Month in Retro!

The usual still applies: I take a look at some of the highlights released this month, as well as the low hanging fruit and the hidden gems. If they have a RetroAchievements set, great! I'll tell you all about how to approach the set based on community feedback. If the game doesn't have a set, then maybe I can somehow convince you to put a set request in. While doing so, I take a look at what critics had to say (only before 2000 since we want opinions of the time from them, not now), what fans around the internet think of the game, and maybe put some sales figures and the legacy it has left behind. Data from the 90s can be a bit wonky however, so please keep that in mind. Without further ado, let's take a look at the releases of December 1994!

# Western Releases

I already slightly eluded to it, but the western side this month took it a bit slower compared to the month before where we had such massive hits as _Donkey Kong Country_. That's not to say that this month was complete drought though, as there were still somehow two Mario-related games released!

What's better than one puzzle game? If your answer is two, then you are a genius. _Tetris & Dr. Mario_ are enhanced remakes of the originals for the NES and Game Boy. Both games feature the same block- or pill-dropping gameplay beloved by puzzle fans all over the world, with the unique feature being the "mixed match" multiplayer mode. In this mode, two players have to play matches between both games interchangeably to end up with the most points at the end. If you only prefer one of the two games though, don't fret as there is still an independent multiplayer mode for both. Features from both the originals have been taken as well, such as the music and A/B-type modes from Game Boy _Tetris_. Suffice to say, for fans of both puzzle games this ended up being a really neat package, with the unique multiplayer mode getting the most praise. Fans are unsurprisingly in agreement since well... it's _Tetris_ and _Dr. Mario_ but better and in one package. It would be hard to mess this up, and fortunately, they didn't.

The achievement set covers both games and will test your skill in both to the max. After all, both puzzle games have higher difficulties and speed, and you won't be getting the mastery if you can't beat either while enduring multiple matches back to back.

And that wasn't the only Mario-related puzzle game either! Released on two consoles at the same time with the NES version being the last officially-licensed NES game in North America, _Wario's Woods_ is another object-falling puzzle game, but this time with Toad waiting at the bottom to line them up together horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Both monsters- and bombs drop, and the player needs to get rid of all the coloured monsters by having at least one bomb in the line-up. Toad does have a few moves up his arsenal to make it easier, give that he isn't able to reach everything. Oh, and as for why the game is named after Wario... he's the villain who only shows up during cutscenes, as he took over the peaceful woods and branded them as his own. That's the only relation it has to Wario really. Critics at the time weren't too fond of the game however, citing it as being a bit too complex--especially on the controls side. And of course, critics loved to compare such a game to other similar games in the genre, and mentioned that it couldn't compete with either _Dr. Mario_ or _Tetris_. It was seen as nothing more than a Tetris clone with a slightly unique twist, but fans were a bit more positive on it, mostly appreciating the difficulty that came with it.

The NES version doesn't have a set yet, but is currently claimed so maybe we'll see it soon! The SNES version does have a set, in which the players have to go through the lengthy story mode to beat every boss, and also make it all the way to round 199 in game mode! As indicated by people in the forums and comment wall, this is extremely tough to do, so a mastery won't come easy. Players have been asking for a rescore due to it being so difficult, so maybe some changes will happen to this set in the future as well!

That's enough puzzle games for today. There's only so many I can talk about before my descriptions growing stale after all. Instead, let's go see what the Atari kids were getting this month!

So, I stray away from the Nintendo consoles and the first character I come across is Bubsy huh? I see how it is. Alright, let's get this over with then. _Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales_ is the third entry in the much beloved Bubsy franchise, that has remained exclusive to the Atari Jaguar to this day. Like its two predecessors, this game is a 2D platformer starring Bubsy the Bobcat, taking place across worlds inspired by fairy tales such as _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ and _Hansel and Gretel_. However, these all end up corrupted and Bubsy is the chosen one set out to fix them. This game was part of an agreement between Atari and Accolade to bring five exclusive titles to their platform, with this originally being a port of the first game that ended up becoming its own project. It does still largely play like the first game for that reason... for better or worse. It didn't get bashed by reviewers too much as it did end up with an average score in the end, citing that the 14 Bubsy fans would really enjoy this, but others may look elsewhere due to high difficulty and sloppy controls. Player scores were far lower, but whether that's due to it being a bad game or just cool to hate on Bubsy is a question I can't answer. After all, it was on the Atari Jaguar; it was doomed from the start not to have many people play it, so it's rare to find opinions about it in the first place.

Despite its reputations, _Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales_ was the first achievement set to be released for the system! It's a pretty straightforward set without too many challenges, but it does cover the entire game and that's what matters the most after all. So if you can get the Jaguar emulator running fine and can endure this game, then a new mastery might end up in your possession!

***

Although it would be easy to give the title of "Worst game of the month" to Bubsy, it actually had some pretty fierce competition from games all about competition. This resulted in not just one, but two Fighting games aiming for that title. One of them is _Rise of the Robots_ on the SNES, and as much as I would like to talk about it since it's a childhood game of mine, it was a game released on pretty much everything and also earlier than December. So instead, I'll just be talking about _Kasumi Ninja_ today.

There is no better way to describe _Kasumi Ninja_ than by directly calling it a _Mortal Kombat_ rip-off. That's not even meant to be mean-spirited as that was literally the intention behind the game: bring the ultra-violent fighting genre to the Jaguar. Digitized graphics are here, one-on-one fighting, and the bloodiest blood the bloody Jaguar has seen. So yeah, _Mortal Kombat_, just with a sprinkle of bad controls and slow gameplay. Ironically the story is kind of okay though? There is a secret island in the ocean where ninjas are trained, with three elder ninjas keeping the cosmic balance between good and evil to keep the netherworld portal closed. One of the elders is possessed, kills the others and wants to destroy the world. But yeah, despite the score still looking to be in the positive digits, it was panned by critics. Somehow a sequel was in the works, but that was cancelled once Atari went out of business, and probably for the better. Gamer opinions were yet again a bit tougher to find due to, y'know, this being an Atari Jaguar game, but the ones I could find do cite it as one of the worst fighting games ever so I think it's safe to say most people didn't like this very much.

Somehow though, this game ended up getting an achievement set! It features fights against all characters on various difficulties, with added requirements to not lose a round against them. While those may sound menacing, the game is so uh, specific that there seems to be specific strategies to accomplishing them. I'm not going to find out though, thank you very much.

...Let's just move back to Nintendo instead. The SNES was during its prime in 1994, so as much as I try to look at other consoles, all interesting releases simply just happened here. I just talked about two of the worst received games released this month, so time to move on to some better games. I'm going down the list first with games that already have a set, until we reach the ones that don't have one yet. So let's move on to some lightning rounds of interesting games released this month!

First up is an adaptation of the animated series by the same name, _Biker Mice From Mars_. The series started in 1993 and lasted three seasons, and like anything that can be turned into a video game, Konami took a shot at it. It is a racer in an isometric perspective, where the player controls one of the mice through various races, earning money in the progress that can be used to upgrade your bike or hinder other racers. Each of the mice also have their own strengths in racing, so there's definitely a mice for every spice. It got an overall positive reception from the critics, and even more so from the fans who really enjoy this game.

The achievement sets focuses a lot on the upgrading aspect, with all bike- and weapon upgrades seeing their own achievement. Of course, due to how different the mice are from each other, beating the game as all of them will bring you closer to you goal as well, with the final obstacle being that you have to beat the game on the highest difficulty. From looking at the wall and the forums the set may be a bit buggy so do keep that in mind.

Sticking with the racing theme for now, we have a very unique one with _Uniracers_, or _Unirally_ for our European brethren. It is unique in multiple ways in that it not only features unicycles without an actual rider on them, but also that the entire game takes place in 2D--something not commonly seen in racing games. And given that the unicycle isn't really known for being a speedy vehicle and rather for stunts, the developers integrated that in the gameplay as well, making you go faster after each successful stunt. And you really do go fast, so it's a good idea to read up on this game before playing because the developers were clever enough to make sure you always knew what was coming up by colouring the rails you're riding on. The reception on the game was positive from both the critics and especially the fans, but it unfortunately just wasn't meant to be as the game faced a lawsuit due to having the unicycles look similar to Pixar's _Red's Dream_. Pretty much everyone can agree that it is complete nonsense, except for the judge himself, resulting in the game having to cease producing copies and for it to never be seen again beyond the SNES, with no hopes of it happening ever either.

Go for gold with this achievement set, as there is an achievement in doing so for every tour! Master some tricks while you're at it and you'll have the mastery of this simple- yet effective set in no time!

Next up are a few games that don't have a set yet. Some of these look really interesting so if you got a set request remaining, one of these may be up for consideration!

_Super Mario Kart_ surely wasn't the only Kart Racer on the platform! Although if you were expecting this to be a _Street Fighter_ Kart Racer, I'm sorry to disappoint but you wouldn't be far off either, since this game does take inspiration from both mentioned games and combines them into one, resulting in a go-kart themed game where you punch the other racers in the face. It also puts in a dose of comedy, having a bunch of unique characters that do also come with their own power-ups, encouraging to test out different characters. Aside from that, we have a standard racer here with multiple championships to go through! Though there weren't many reviews to be found by critics, the one that were online were all fairly positive, sometimes even calling it a Kart Racer that surpasses the king. Gamers were slightly less positive on it but still regard it as a solid racer for any fan to check out. _Street Racer_ would also see multiple ports to systems such as the Game Boy, PlayStation, and Sega consoles, but the SNES version is generally agreed on to be the best.

_Metal Morph_ is a blend between two genres, alternating between a run and gun and a rail shooter. But what the developers have added to differentiate itself from the competition in both genres is the titular MetalMorphosis. The main character and the ship he is controlling can transform into a metal blob at any time, navigating through otherwise inaccessible spaces and negating all damage. Still, not everything is at it seems, since the main character also dies in one hit. And with deaths having the potential to be very cheap such as being off-screen, this can lead to some anger moments. Critics and gamers also 100% agree with each other that the shooting segments weren't very fun, resulting in _Metal Morph_ being a mixed and eventually forgotten game, leaving no legacy behind whatsoever.

Normally I wouldn't look twice at a game like this. I mean, it's football-related; everyone knows that football and I are arch enemies. But, to give credit where it is due, it is a platformer. Still with a football theme, but it is a platformer. Based on the animated show with the same name, _Hurricanes_ follows two different protagonist going through 2D Platforming levels, using their football skills (also known as just kicking a ball) to prevent a villainous team from stopping them to participate in the World Cup. Simple premise, but what works that works. Critics didn't really think too much of it though, and gamers were pretty much on the same line: it's a functional game, just very much what you would expect from any 2D Platformer.

It is time to bring the western side to a close this month. There's one final game I wanted to look at... or rather, games, since we got both an SNES and Game Boy game with the same name! Hey, I talk about something not from the SNES, we're moving up!

Two for the price of one, what a way to end today's Western release. _Tiny Toon Adventures: Wacky Sports_ is a sports party game, taking a bit of a more cartoony approach to some Olympic sports like bungee jumping and obstacle courses. This is one of the few games that works with the SNES Multitap, allowing up to four players at once. This doesn't apply to the Game Boy version however, which is completely single player and also features its own events, making both games share the same idea but with different gameplay. It's a very straightforward concept and one that should work well for any big cartoon, yet critics somehow weren't too fond of it. I couldn't really find out why since almost every negative review is in a language that's not English, but gamers are at least more positive on it... at least, the few I could find. I really wish I could find out more since they look like harmless games, but apparently they went completely under the radar. Fortunately that didn't mean too much to _Tiny Toon Adventures_ as a whole since that series kept pumping out games at a nice rate, but these ones definitely aren't talked about often.

The Game Boy version does not have a set yet, but the SNES version does with a pretty extensive one at that! The game has a total of four difficulty modes, and the three highest have to be approached in regard to every event. Qualify, get some high scores, and beat the game as each of the four characters without losing a life! It is one of the older sets of the site but also one that doesn't have too many masters, so be prepared for a difficult journey.

# Japanese-exclusive Releases

Remember when I teased at the beginning that the Japanese side this month would be a bit more special to me? Well, here we are. You may have heard of the backlog site [Infinite Backlog](https://infinitebacklog.nl/) before. There was a news post made both in the Discord community as well as on the site itself. Very recently, a list feature was introduced where people can create their own personal- and/or informational lists to the public. I myself took a shot at this as well, resulting in three separate lists:

* [All Western-released RPGs on the SNES](https://infinitebacklog.nl/users/nepiki/lists/212)
* [All Japanese-exclusive RPGS on the SNES with fan-translation](https://infinitebacklog.nl/users/nepiki/lists/56)
* [All Japanese-exclusive RPGS on the SNES without fan-translation](https://infinitebacklog.nl/users/nepiki/lists/58)

And it just so happens that this month, a surprising amount of those lists were released. I'll go only over the translated ones since the non-translated ones will be tougher to get a set due to how much knowledge of the Japanese knowledge is needed. This includes the following titles: 

* _The Last Battle_
* _Sugoro Quest ++ Dicenics_
* _Albert Odyssey 2_
* _Hao Taikai Ryu Knight_

 I'll also go through them a bit quicker since like I said, the amount of Japanese games released this month is pretty high and I can't talk in-depth about every single one while also talking about non-RPGs. So let's get on to it!

| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| **Release date** | JP: December 9, 1994 |

There's no better place to start than with the only game that has an achievement set, and very recently too! _Wonder Project J: Kikai no Shounen Pino_ is technically not an RPG, but it's difficult to truly attribute one genre to this game so close enough. This game is loosely based on the story of Pinocchio, with the main protagonist being a robot named Pino, developed by Dr. Geppetto, and accompanied by a fairy named Tinker. It's not even hiding the inspiration really, but that's fine since _Wonder Project J_ is a really interesting and unique game where you raise the robot to become more human, with a ton of emotions to keep in mind while doing so. As a result, most people refer to this game more as a "Life Simulation" game, and that would definitely be closest to what it is. Very unique, and also a highly impressive game for the system that did end up seeing a sequel due to its success.

If you want the mastery, it is time to prove whether you have what it takes to make the lovable robot into a human. Raise all its emotional stats to the max and activate circuits in the heart, and that mastery will be yours in no time.

| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| **Release date** | JP: December 2, 1994 |

Since we were talking about one game that defies genre, we might as well cover the next one too. If you've heard the title _Dokapon_ before, you're probably familiar with them being board games with a heavy emphasis on RPG mechanics, like leveling up, gaining gear, and battling it out. _Dokapon 3-2-1_ is exactly that as well, and it coincidentally is also the game where the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Wii title _Dokapon Kingdom_ is a remake of. It is the second game in the franchise by the same name, where a group of heroes duke it out with each other to see who can save the kingdom first rather than making the logical decision of working together. Overall the games are pretty fun, but I hope you can deal with a bit of RNG getting in the way of your prize!

| Game                                                                                                                         |

| **Release date** | JP: December 22, 1994 |

Alright, let's move on to the true RPGs, starting with _Daikaijuu Monogatari_, commonly known by the unofficial fan-translated title _Super Shell Monsters Story_. A hero is summoned from another world due to the awakening of the evil demon king Fat Badger, and this hero must go out to find friendly shell monsters around the world to form a team and defeat this evil once and for all in turn-based combat that looks to be similar to games like _Lufia_ in terms of display... and high encounter rate. It's a solid game all-around which resulted in it getting a sequel on the same system, as well as a manga adaptation. It's certainly one of the more overlooked translated RPGs on the SNES, so for that alone it is definitely worth giving a shot!

| Game                                                                                                                |

| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| **Release date** | JP: December 29, 1994 |

_Dual Orb II_ is the sequel to the other Japanese-exclusive title _Dual Orb_, released a year prior. That game unfortunately has not seen a translation patch yet though, but from what I could gather, knowledge of the first game isn't necessary to enjoy this game. While the first game had a more Dragon Warrior-like setting, this plot features the revival of an evil scientist by, who else, the empire. This scientist worked together with another to make major advancements in the world of science- and technology, but after discovering an orb of infinite power, the other scientist had to stop him from using it for world domination. Now, many years later, it is up to an heaven-sent Paladin and his teammates to stop him once and for all with a battle system looking very much like it was the predecessor to the likes of _Grandia_! Fans who have played the fan translation are overall positive on it, though they do pretty much all comment on the difficulty being pretty high, so beware.

| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| **Release date** | JP: December 02, 1994 |

The second game in a trilogy exclusively developed for the Super Famicom, _Aretha II: Ariel no Fushigi na Tabi_ is a direct sequel to the first game. Fortunately, this time the first game also has a translation ready, but none of the games have an achievement set yet. Following the events of the first game, young princess Ariel enjoys her time of peace until that peace is threatened... again. Insert shocked face emoji here. It will probably happen in the third game too. She gathers her old companions and set out to destroy evil again so she can rule in peace without having to worry about an ultimate evil. This is done in a first-person perspective, with the unique feature of this battle system being the collecting of souls after battle that have multiple purposes like creating armour.

***

Alright, that's enough RPGs for now. I will be sticking on the Super Famicom just a bit longer though, simply because most games were released for that system not just in the west, but in Japan as well. For now though, let's take it a bit easier with some sweet platformers, with two of them already having sets!

| Game                                                                                                                                    |

| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| **Release date** | JP: December 22, 1994 |

Released exclusively for the Super Famicom is _Pokonyan! Henpokorin Adventure_. A very unknown game as it has barely any information on the internet, which is a shame since it looks like a fun platforming time! It features a tanuki as main protagonist, prankster creatures who are known for transforming into other objects or creatures, and that's exactly the selling point of this game. Our main protagonist can transform into various animals like a bird or kangaroo to change up the platforming, but on his own he's nothing to scoff at either as he's very fast on his feet to reach speeds seen usually on the Genesis instead. Unfortunately this game does not have a translation patch, but due to its nature as a platformer, knowledge of the language is barely needed.

The game is fairly short, therefore being a good candidate for more challenging achievements that have to do with beating the game, such as no deaths or a specific amount of points. There's an achievement for beating the game within 10 minutes after all, so this is a game designed to be mastered! Are you up for the task?

It was always a bit odd to me that some Disney games were never localized during the 16-bit era, but this one is at least slightly understandable. After all, it's based on the Tokyo version of Disneyland, with all of the levels being designed after attractions from this theme park as well. Mickey has to go through all of these places because Pete told his friends that they had a day-off, and slave driver Mickey won't allow that to happen. He goes through a bunch of platforming levels not too different from other Mickey platformers, though what separates this game from the others are the unique balloon mechanics. Mickey can blow up balloons at any time to float upwards or shoot across the screen by popping them, as well as using water balloons for puzzles or destroying his enemies. If you are looking for another solid Disney platformer to add to your line-up, this is definitely one worth considering.

A translation patch is available for this game, but this is not yet linked to the achievement set so keep that in mind. Not that you really need it but it's always good to keep in mind. The achievement set it pretty extensive with a lot of collecting to do in levels and taking no damage or deaths, so there's a lot to do here!

| Game                                                                                                                    |

_Wagyan Paradise_ definitely wins the price for cutest game this month and, as a result, probably the game I would like to see get an achievement set the most. This game does lack a translation patch unfortunately though, but as it is a platformer, minimal knowledge of the language is needed to enjoy the game. It is a follow up to _Wagyan Land_ for the Famicom which did get a translation patch, so that could possibly get a set too. Anyway, I'm getting off track. After choosing your gender and age, resulting in you controlling either Takuto or Karin, with the difficulty also being influenced by whether you are six years or younger. Strange events occur around their home island, so they go out on a side-scrolling platformer adventure to find the cause. The cute robotic animals are pacifists though, so they won't hurt enemies but stun them instead, with the ability to use them as platforms afterwards. It's just a really cute platformer overall with great level design. A translation patch would be ideal, but it is certainly playable as is!

Alright, this edition of This Month in Retro is looooong so there's one final game I wanted to talk about. After all, remember that the PlayStation 1 was born this month? There weren't really any Japanese-exclusive launch games worth talking about... that is, except for one. What else but the king of them all, the debut game of one of the greatest game development studios ever? Of course, I'm talking about...

| Game                                                                                                                         |

| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| **Release date** | JP: December 16, 1994 |

_King's Field_! Arguably the daddy of the Souls-like genre, the very first _King's Field_ game was released during this month. And to avoid confusion: The _King's Field_ that we got is actually _King's Field II_ in Japan; we never got the very first game. Which is a big shame since this game is highly influential to pretty much everything FromSoftware has created afterwards. _King's Field_ is a first-person Action RPG taking place in an underground labyrinth to discover the source of the invasion of monsters. This is done through a difficult combat system that needs to be carefully approached, as it is pretty easy to leave yourself open and defeated as a result due to the stamina system, where you can only slash and cast spells when the bar is full. The dungeon itself has five levels which can be backtracked between after unlocking portals, and there is also a bunch of gear to be found so exploration is always encouraged. This high difficulty did initially result in bad sales, but word of mouth eventually did the job and the game became a commercial success, making FromSoftware's debut game one for the ages.

This game has a translation patch that is fortunately linked to the achievement set. And what a nice set it is with over 100 achievements to get! A lot of them are focused on collecting items and learning about your enemies, but of course, there is also the classic: beat game without die. You can do it!

# Conclusion

1994 was a huge year for gaming, and even though it already looks like I talked about so many games, there were far more released this month than I was able to talk about. But despite the quantity, the amount of stand-out games was on the lower side. On the western side, it's really tough to determine any game that stood above the rest, while it is quite easy to find out which are the worst. The Japanese side had even more games where it was the opposite; tough to find the worst games, easy to find great games. Quite a funny contrast isn't it?

Since we went to the 2000s two times in a row last time, let's go back further to 1990 for January. Hope to see you there!
