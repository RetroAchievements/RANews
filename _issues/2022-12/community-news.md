## Emulator Updates

### RAIntegration v1.1.0
- Support for indirect code notes (code notes derived from a note on a pointer)
- If the first line of a code note contains the keyword "pointer", then any following line that starts with a plus (no indent) immediately followed by a number (hexadecimal [0x prefix] or decimal, no whitespace) is treated as an indirect code note. After the number, any number of whitespace characters and/or a single non-alphanumeric character separate the indirect note from the offset. Following lines that don't start with a plus are also considered part of the indirect note. Some examples are shown [here](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAIntegration/pull/902#issuecomment-1180878607).
- Support for local code notes
  - Allows making temporary notes while trying to narrow down addresses
  - Fixes loss of note-in-progress if selected address is changed
  - Note modifications are kept locally until published to the server
  - Unpublished notes will appear in red in the code notes window
  - Notes are deleted by reverting (if not published) or by setting to blank and publishing
- Support for offline development (if the game was previously loaded in online mode)
  - Offline mode is only activated if the server cannot be contacted during login.
  - It's not meant to be something a developer can just activate whenever they want.
  - Changes will be saved to local file (XXX-User.txt)
  - Publishing is disabled
  - Achievements unlocked in offline mode will not be sync'ed to the server, and will not be eligible for manual unlocks.
- Add Open All and Code Notes items to RetroAchievements menu
- Add MBF32 LE memory size
- Add BitCount search type
- Add XOR (^) AddSource/SubSource modifier
- Add ASCII as selectable size in bookmarks window
- Add warning when serialized size exceeds limit
- Add Export button to search results
- Automatically change asset filter to local if local assets exist and no published assets exist
- Changed points field on achievement editor to dropdown
- Allow Invert to be selected for non-value logic
- Allow rich presence monitor to be resized
- Fix app title being updated on login/logout when not using `RA_UpdateAppTitle`
- Fix search results being cleared when switching between disks of a multi-disk game
- Fix crash enabling highlights without a loaded asset
- Fix comparison against initial values for aligned searches
- Fix redundancy warning between trigger and non-trigger conditions
- Fix decoding of denormalized floats (values where exponent is 2^-127)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAIntegration/releases/tag/RAIntegration.1.1.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RALibretro/releases/tag/1.4.0)

## RATools Updates
- new internal representation of logic
  - small performance boost due to not having to reevaluate on each usage
  - allows for more optimization opportunities<br>
    **NOTE**: this causes errors to be generated for several previously allowed syntaxes:
    - Implicit `always_true()` and `always_false()` are no longer supported in logic chains. Logic such as: `0=1 && never(byte(0x1234) == 3)` will now collapse to `false` as `0=1` can never be true. Script authors must replace the `0=1` with an `always_false()` to preserve the logic in the output.
    - Memory addresses can no longer be compared to `true` or `false`. Compare to `1` or `0` instead.
    - `always_true()` and `always_false()` are no longer supported for leaderboard values. use `measured(repeated(0, always_true()))` and `0` instead.
    - Integer division is no longer implicitly converted to floats for leaderboard values: `byte(0x1234) * 3 / 2` will no longer be automatica0lly converted to `byte(0x1234) * 1.5`. use `byte(0x1234) * 3.0 / 2` for automatic conversion.
    - Calling `repeated` or `tally` with a count of 0 is no longer supported outside of a `measured` clause of a value expression. Doing so implies an unbounded hit requirement which cannot be reached and is equivalent to `always_false()`. Using these to generate an AndNext/OrNext chain was not intended. If you absolutely want to prevent the OrNext from being converted to alt groups use the `__ornext(condition)` function. If you have a valid reason for forcing an AndNext chain let me know.
    - `measured(A && B)` will now generate an error instead of just setting the Measured flag on B. The actual logic it previously generated was `A && measured(B)` or `measured(repeated(0, A && B))` depending on whether it was being used in a trigger expression or a value expression.
    - `once(A && once(B))` will now keep a separate hit count for B and for the entire clause by reordering the conditions or injecting an `always_false()` condition to hold the total count.
    - `once(unless(A))` will now generate an error. use `unless(once(A))` or `disable_when(A)` instead. Similarly, `unless` cannot be used inside `repeated` or `tally` clauses.
    - `repeated(10, trigger_when(A))` will now generate an error. use `trigger_when(repeated(10, A))` instead.
    - `repeated(10, measured(A))` will now generate an error. use `measured(repeated(10, A))` instead.
- support for local code notes
- add Progression analysis dialog (open from Game Stats dialog)
- add ability to autogenerate function names in New Script dialog
- fix `measured(bitcount(X) == 8)` being converted to `measured(byte(X) == 255)`
- fix `measured(X + 100 > 200)` being converted to `measured(X > 100)`
- fix `float(X) < 0` being converted to `always_false()`
- fix `never` in `tally` clause being replaced with AndNext
- fix Copy to Clipboard not working on Rich Presence and Leaderboard title/description
- fix duplicating of file extension for local badge images
- fix dumping Rich Presence with measured value in display string
- fix viewing Rich Presence diff where lookup was removed

## Discord Updates
- `art-requests` channel has been updated to be forum based to make it easier for the art team to organize, track and discuss art requests.
- `rapatches` forum channel has been created allowing users to request patches to add to the [RAPatches GitHub](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAPatches), help creating or converting patches, general reports, etc.
- `site-feedback` channel created for quick feedback. The official [RAWeb GitHub](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb) should still be used for more in depth discussions regarding site issues and enhancements.
