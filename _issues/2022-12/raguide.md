## **Introduction**

Zillion is a classic Sega Master System game from 1987 based on the anime by the same name. The premise of the game is to infiltrate the Norsa base and program its main computer to initiate self destruction. The game is a somewhat Metrovania where the main gimmick is using codes found nearby computers to unlock access to new rooms.

It is the year 2387 and you start off as the young protagonist JJ, a member of the paramilitary group the White Nuts. The other two members of his squad, Apple and Champ, have already attempted to infiltrate the base, but were captured and are imprisoned. During the mission, JJ can rescue Apple and Champ and switch to them as additional characters during game play.

Your mission is to find the five floppy disks in the Norsa base and use the red ID card to access the main computer and input the explode command to initiate its self destruct sequence and return to your ship before the base explodes.


## **Compatibility**

The achievements require the following linked hash:

## **Road Map**

The best way to tackle the set would be to do the full game run first. This will require you to rescue Apple, Champ, get all the level up items, gun upgrades, blue ID cards, bread and learn the lay out of the base. You can earn all but two achievements in this run.

The next achievement you should tackle requires another play through, but without rescuing Apple or Champ. You will be more resource constrained as you only have access to JJ, but it is manageable with your prior knowledge.

The final achievement you should attempt is No Time to Waste, the timed achievement to rescue Apple. This achievement will require a solid understanding of the code recognition and entering that can only be learned through practice. Fortunately, you'll have had two complete play throughs and will have a great start at building the proficiency needed for it.


## **Resources**

The single most useful resource for the vast majority of the run is the map available at: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/sms/588176-zillion/map/1176-game-map

[Zillion Longplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKhwO571-1U)

The symbols in Zillion may appear difficult to remember as your first impression of them maybe to think they are things like an M, heart, bug, etc. By far the best technique is to recognize the symbols as numbers:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106546659/179338697-9b67a3ec-a8ca-4f5a-aa43-7c6ecba4bdbc.png)

This will drastically improve your ability to memorize the room codes as you learn them and save you from having to take copious notes. Without learning to quickly memorize the symbols, the No Time to Waste achievement will not be possible.


## **Achievements**

The only missable achievement is a time based challenge to rescue Apple within 8 minutes and 45 second of starting the game. This is a very difficult achievement and all that needs to be done to try again is start a new game.

- No Time to Waste

_Rescue Apple from the Norsa base_

Apple is located in the middle section of the base. On the gamefaqs map, Apple is located in the top row of red rooms near the center in the yellow rectangular symbol.

Note: There is a leaderboard for rescuing Apple the fastest.

_Defeat the dragon after initiating the main computer's self destruct sequence_

After initiating the self destruct sequence, the dragon will be in your way as you begin the escape. The dragon is vulnerable when its mouth is open to shoot fire balls.

Note: There are two leaderboards associated with this fight. One for killing the dragon the fastest and the other for killing it in as few shots as possible.

_Escape the Norsa base before it self destructs and return to the ship_

After defeating the dragon during the escape you must run back to the surface through the base. There will not be any more enemies nor traps during the escape. The fastest route is to take the first exit from the elevator into the room where you found the red ID card, go left three rooms, down one, then left three more to reach the elevator back to the middle section of the base.

When you reach the first red room, head up twice, then right into the elevator and take the first exit and go right until the fourth red room. Go up once, left once then take the elevator up to the upper section of the base.

Go left to the third room, then go up, then right all the way to the elevator. Take the elevator up to the surface. As long as you reach the surface before time expires you will be safe. The ending and achievement will trigger when you return to the ship regardless of how much time is left on the countdown.

Note: There is a leaderboard for returning to your ship the fastest.

_Use a computer code to temporarily disable a laser barrier, an alarm sensor, a moving walkway and an auto gun_

As you progress through the base and come across various traps, use the following codes to disable one of each kind at some point. Note you will lose a blue ID card for inputting these codes so make sure you have at least one left.

Disable alarm sensor: 3 3 3 3

_Get another blue ID card after your inventory is already full_

Pick up a blue ID card when your inventory on the status screen is already showing you possessing 10. Blue ID cards are plentiful and this should naturally happen unless you are burning through them by using preset computer codes in virtually every room.

_Find the secret room in the upper section of the Norsa base_

At the first hallway in the first elevator, go all the way left, past the mines until you reach another elevator. Shoot the bottom left wall about eight times and a passage will be revealed allowing you to enter the secret room.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/259570.png) **What Is That Doing in There?** (3 points)

_Uncover a hidden loaf of bread within a wall_

There are three walls in the hallways of the base where if you shoot them about eight times a loaf of bread will appear, although you cannot get it. The easiest one is the top left room of the base, just above the secret room at the end of the hallway. There are two more at the bottom of the elevators on the left side of the middle section of the base. The map depicts the locations of the hidden breads.

The room nearest to the main elevator shaft on the top row if you initially head left, up, then back right has a capsule locked behind two doors. To unlock the doors, you need to lay down and shoot the lower wall next to the capsule on the right wall that contains bread. After about eight shots the doors will open.

_Complete the mission with all members of the White Nuts alive without using a continue_

_Rescue Apple in less than 8 minutes and 45 seconds without using a continue_

This is by far the most difficult achievement in the set. From the time you get control of JJ, you have to rescue Apple in less than 8 minutes and 45 seconds. I created a tutorial video to help people learn how to very quickly recognize and enter room codes as well as see the required route needed to be taken. There is a little margin for error, but very little.

In the demo below, I complete the achievement with about 20 seconds to spare, but those 20 seconds can be lost very quickly. If it took just 1 second longer per room with a code then this demo would have been down to the wire. The biggest thing within your control is your ability to quickly memorize and enter the codes so make sure that isn't your limiting factor, but knowing and practicing the routing is key.

_Complete the mission without rescuing Apple or Champ without using a continue_

Simply complete the game without saving either Apple or Champ. This will limit you to just JJ's health, but you can take advantage of the many extra level up items available to restore some lost health.
