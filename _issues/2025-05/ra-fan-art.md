Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

And here we have Guile from the Street Fighter series, donning some glasses, his favourite gun, and his beloved pet bald eagle. A true family guy if I've ever seen one.

All the generation 1 starters have gathered around the television playing the Nintendo 64! Pikachu is very focused, and Squirtle has his glasses on to show the rest who is truly the boss.

You know Ashley, that infamous character from Resident Evil 4 that shouts Leon and makes you hate escort missions? Well, Leon had a thought... maybe he could just bribe her with cheese? Hey, if it works it works!

And to finish off the day, we have the younger version of Link also going on a journey! This time it's Wind Waker Link trying to save Hyrule... but more importantly, complete the Nintendo Gallery! Will he manage to complete the task?
