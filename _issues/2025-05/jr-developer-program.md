| ⭐    | {% ragamepic 21988, 097818, Super Farm %} | {% rauserpic Candyiela %} | {% rauserpic wolfman2000 %} | 4/11/2025    |

What's better than Kirby using his wheel ability? A game that is just about this, a car tire racing to the end of each track while shooting everything that is in its way. In this Shoot-em-up game you need to race to the finish line as fast as possible while avoiding obstacles on the track that you need to avoid through tight maneuvers and jumping, while continuously shooting enemies that want to stop you. Start your engine and hop right on the track.

|      | {% ragamepic 15499, 083368, Death Note: Kira Game %} | {% rauserpic streetbackguy %} | {% rauserpic Layton %} | 4/18/2025    |

|      | {% ragamepic 16287, 110914, Porsche Challenge %} | {% rauserpic TheAdmiester %} | {% rauserpic RyCuLe %} | 4/24/2025    |

Porsche Challenge is a fun, bite-sized, arcadey racing game for the PS1 that has some surprisingly in-depth mechanics, such as driver relationships - where the other drivers behave differently depending on whether or not they like yours - and interactive variants of tracks where the route shifts between laps. Add in a Jason Page soundtrack, some rather advanced lighting for its time, and some great FMVs from the Porsche archive and you have a fun overlooked title!

|      | {% ragamepic 7216, 082742, Charlotte's Web %} | {% rauserpic KombuchaMush %} | {% rauserpic Whithbrin %} | 4/28/2025    |

Charlotte's Web follows the story of a children's book, and later a movie, in which a livestock pig called Wilbur meets with a barn spider named Charlotte which saves his life. In this action-platformer players follows the story of the movie with several minigames being sprinkled in every once in a while. Cute and highly detailed graphics, as well as the gameplay designed for kids make this game a very chill and comfy game to play.
