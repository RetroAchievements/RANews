## Overview

### The achievements can be grouped into a few types.

- Story Achievements (these cannot be missed).
- Tournament related (you will need to complete them anyway to progress the story).
- Trading related (ALL of these are missable).
- Digi-Beetle parts (Buy/find the Digi-Beetle parts, and fully upgrade them).
- Digivolutions (Recruit or Digivolve into specific Digimons).

### General Tips / Walkthrough Notes for Missable Achievements

- The game only have 3 save slots. It is recommended to make multiple backup of your save files, in case you missed some missable achievements or messed up your DNA Digivolve.
- Check the Digivolution chart before DNA Digivolving. Some Digimon trees cannot go further than `Ultimate` or even `Champion`.
    - `SandYanmamon` is an example `Champion` Digimon that cannot digivolve. If you accidentally DNA into it, you will lose all your `Ultimate` skills.
- Be sure to check the `Digimon Center` every time you progress thru the story, and try to trade them as soon as possible.
- When you reach `Disk Domain`, be prepared for the "**Angemon's Gift**" missable achievement.
- When you reach `BIOS Domain`, be prepared for the "**MetalGreymon**" missable achivement.
- The `BIOS Domain` is also your final chance at trading the `ToyAgumon` for the "**So Many Different Agumon**" missable achievement.
- When you reach `Device Dome`, you will gain access to buy the `PegasusEG1`. Keep this engine and fully upgrade it before you reach `File Island`, for the "**Pegasus Engine**" missable achievement.
- When you reach `File Island`, the first domain there is `Power Domain`. Be prepared for the "**Jurassic Park**" achievement.
- When you reach `Core Tower`, make sure you are prepared for the missable "**Proven Your Worth**" achievement.
- Continue until you beat the game, watch the credits, and you will be back to the world. Complete the rest of your achievements via the final `Tera Domain` grind.
- The final grind will be recruiting every Digimons listed in the achievements set.
    - Most can be found in the `Tera Domain`.
    - Some of them are very hard or impossible to recruit, so manually digivolving them might be easier. Check the Digivolution section of the guide for tips.

This is the only Digi-Beetle part that is missable, because you cannot install it back once your Digi-Beetle is upgraded to the `Admantium Body`. Be sure to fully upgrade it before you install the `AdmantCore`. |

These do not appear in the wild, and can only be obtained via Digivolving them.

Easy steps for getting all 3 above:
- Recruit the following: 1x `WarGreymon`, 1x `Airdramon`, 7x `Greymon`.
- DNA `Airdramon` + `Greymon` = `Veemon`.
- Level him up into Champion (`Veedramon` at first, and later `Flamedramon`).
- DNA the `Veedramon` or `Flamedramon` + `Greymon` = back into `Veemon`, to increase its DP.
- Repeat until you reach DP 7, then DNA the `Flamedramon` + `WarGreymon` = back into `Veemon`.
- With a DP 8 `Veemon`, level him up into Mega. You will get `Flamedramon`, `Raidramon`, and `I-dramon` in one go.

Although they do appear in `Tera Domain`, they are very rare and very hard to recruit. Because they only appear on higher levels of the domain, and they usually spawn in a small room accompanied by `Rookie` Digimons that move 2 squares per turn. Digivolving them could be an easier option.

Steps for obtaining all 3 achievements above:
- Recruit lots of `Triceramon` and DNA them into `Tyrannomon` over and over again, to build up its DP.
    - `Triceramon` + `Triceramon` = `Tyrannomon`.
	- Level `Tyrannomon` up, he will digivolve into `Triceramon`.
	- DNA the `Triceramon` with another `Triceramon` again, and repeat.
	- At DP 8 onwards, `Tyrannomon` will digivolve into `MasterTyrannomon`.
	- Continue DNA the `MasterTyrannomon` with `Triceramon` back into `Tyrannomon`.
	- Repeat until your `Tyrannomon` is DP 18, level him up into `MasterTyrannomon`.
- At DP 18, DNA the `MasterTyrannomon` + `WarGreymon` back into `Tyrannomon`.
- Now DP 19 `Tyrannomon`, level him up into `Mega` to get `WarGreymon`.
- DNA the `WarGreymon` + `Machinedramon` = `MetalGreymon`.
- At DP 20, `MetalGreymon` will digivolve into `Omnimon` (achievement pop!).
- DNA the `Omnimon` + `M-Garurumon` = `Meteormon`.
- `Meteormon` will digivolve into `Baihumon` (achievement pop!).
- DNA the `Baihumon` + `GranKuwagamon` = `Okuwamon`.
- `Okuwamon` will digivolve into `Diaboromon` (achievement pop!).

### Rest of the Megas

They can all be found in the `Tera Domain` that opens up after endgame.
You can find where they are in MetalKid's Digipedia. Some are easier, and some requires a bit more luck.
