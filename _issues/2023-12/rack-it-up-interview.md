Hello! I'm {% rauserpic jamesbuc %} and I was given the fun little task of doing an interview with one of RA's members for Week 3 of the Rack it Up challenge! I instantly knew who I wanted to get some Q&A's out of. Say hello to user {% rauserpic GrampyBack %}, a user who previously did a lot of speedrunning, but who now streams on twitch and creates videos on YouTube chronicling his path on RA with his "Road 2 Rank 1" series.

<code style="color : orange">jamesbuc</code> - For everyone who doesn't know you, tell everyone a bit about yourself.

<code style="color : #0E86D4">GrampyBack</code> - Howdy, My name is GrampyBack. I'm a father of 4 (SAVE ME). I was given this nickname during my time in the US Army. I love Fighting Games, RPGs, anything retro or indie. I've been gaming for 40 years. I held and lost multiple speedrun WRs. On April 14, 2023, I started making content on retro achievement hunting and never looked back.

<code style="color : orange">jamesbuc</code> - So you've been streaming and putting on YouTube your "Road 2 Rank 1" series. What made you want to do this?

<code style="color : #0E86D4">GrampyBack</code> - Multiple factors went into Road 2 Rank 1 Retro Achievements videos. I wanted to do something unhinged, something people would never think could happen, something else happen, something I would never expect. Supporters and people pushing me forward.

It warms my heart. I do have my doubters, but that's just a part of life.

I also wanted to take a break from speed running, but I didn't want to stop playing retro games. That's when I discovered Retro Achievements on Reddit. I saw a post that said, "I love retro achievements, but there's not enough content out there; it's all too similar." This motivated me to showcase RA and create well-put-together videos" so that people can join me on this unforgiving journey.

<code style="color : orange">jamesbuc</code> - What has been your toughest game so far?

<code style="color : #0E86D4">GrampyBack</code> - Vagrant story has to be that game right now. I try to play the game straight up before I pull out the Tips and tricks. At this time, I feel like I'm doing everything wrong, and this game has my number. That number is 25 out of 200 achievements.

<code style="color : orange">jamesbuc</code> - What game or system would you want to see in the future?

<code style="color : #0E86D4">GrampyBack</code> - GameCube 100%. I would love to see Xbox 360 in two years, but GameCube for the win. Mario Kart: Double Dash, Metroid Prime, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and the list goes on and on

For Games
1. NEO Contra (PS2)
2. Colony Wars Red Sun (PS1)
3. SaGa Frontier (PS1)
4. Ace Combat 4: Shattered Skies (PS2)

<code style="color : orange">jamesbuc</code> - Where can people catch up with what you're up to Retroachievement-wise?

<code style="color : #0E86D4">GrampyBack</code> - People can catch me live over at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@GrampyTV) (I try to post every Friday) or on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/grampy_back) ( M-W-F 8pm PST for the live stream). Of course, people can catch me on RA or on the RA discord. Always open to meet all people.

I want to say thank you good people for your time and energy.
