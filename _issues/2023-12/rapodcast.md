# Episode 17 - Breaking Fresh Land, with Wes Copeland

With our videogame website hitting new record breaking active users regularly, and having talked on episodes prior about where we started; I couldn't help but ask myself as I'm sure others do as well: Where are we going, and what does that look like? What started as a small but concentrated effort by a group of friends, has now morphed into a zeitgeist of entertainment that evolves by the month. 

Ultimately, while the end goal for all of us would appear to be "have a good time", what is considered an achievement can be quite subjective. With so many moving pieces on the board, some guidance and perspective from those who are putting the figurative pen to paper could be valuable.

For exactly that reason, I have my guest here today, Wes Copeland - Recent admin, official Guinness record holder, and web developer for RetroAchievements - With a rich history and catalog of experience built up through tech and real world application, this is sure to be a fantastic discussion.
