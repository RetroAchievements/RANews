## System Upgrade & API Enabled
We're thrilled to announce that our system has just undergone a major migration to brand-new servers, geared towards enhancing the performance of our platform. we've also reinstated the full Web API, now available for our community members to explore and utilize.

Our team is constantly working behind the scenes, making updates to optimize settings on the servers and in the codebase. Expect smoother interactions, faster responses, and an overall improved performance on the platform.

## Progression Features

With the release of RAWeb 5.2, the Progression feature has been fully rolled out. The web team has been hard at work for months implementing this feature, alongside several other site improvements. This feature enables the progression typing that the developers have been adding to their sets as well as the beaten game awards. There are several new ways to track beaten games, see summarized stats, view completion progress, and more.
