Gladly, the last checkpoint is right before the final boss, so you won't need to retry a whole stage in order to face Dracula like you need to when you die to other bosses (three whole stages when you lose all your lives and need to hit continue, which are infinite, gladly). So don't worry about that. Naturally, when you die you will lose all your hearts and any sub-weapon you might be holding, but the anti-chamber before Dracula's throne room has plenty of candles for you to break so you can get hearts (although you will need to use them wisely); as for the sub-weapon, in the far-left side of the boss room there's a Holy Water (which is is the strongest sub-weapon in the game anyway), but if you have died here you will have to save your hearts for Dracula's second form because of limited hearts (if you are here while being able to not die in the stages prior to this boss fight, then you'll have some more leniency in the use of your sub-weapon).

In his first form, Dracula will keep teleporting around the room while launching fireballs at you; he's prone to teleport right where you are standing, so it's a good habit to keep wandering around the room nonstop – go back and forth even when Dracula is nowhere to be seen because when he appears it will save you response time; since you are already in motion, you will avoid being hurt by his body hitbox. Wait for Dracula to reappear in the room and he will open his cape before shooting fireballs at you. Jump over the fireballs and whip him in the head (the only place that will deal damage to him). Be alert to the fact that if you jump too early, he will shoot upwards, aiming at you in mid-air, so only jump after you see the fireballs being hurled out of his cape. Repeat it until he dies... At least his humanoid form.

Then he will transform into a large bat-like demon creature, which will hop around the arena and shoot down fireballs. The cheesiest way of defeating him here is by tossing Holy Water at him and then jumping so you can whip him in the head several times while the Holy Water is burning – the Holy Water will keep the monster stunned as long as it is burning him, and that way you can walk through Dracula without taking damage while it is stunned, which is specially useful to change sides when you are cornered in either end of the screen – if you have enough room to maneuver, then you can bite a few more hits while the boss is stunned by the sub-weapon. This is probably enough to defeat his final form. In case you end up spending all you hearts, then you'll have to do it the hard way: when he jumps, get underneath him so you can get on his other side and attack him (do it specially when you are cornered, but attacking after going to his other side is almost guaranteed to avoid being stomped or burned). Be wary to jump over the fireballs he spits, and for that the same rule for the first form applies: only jump when the fireballs are alreay coming towards you, or else Dracula will shoot them higher to reach you while in the air.
