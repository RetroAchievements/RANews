# 2) Game Introduction

The Oracle games, both Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons, are unique entries in [The Legend of Zelda](https://retroachievements.org/game/7852) franchise. They tell two individual, complete tales that can be played standalone, but their legacy is with the ability to use passwords to continue the story from one game to the next, bring not only new story beats but also gameplay changes you may not expect.

# 3) Set Introduction

Oracle of Seasons has 59 achievements, with 37 written by {% rauser dude1286 %} and 22 written by {% rauser FBernkastelKues %}. Oracle of Ages has 55 achievements, with 34 written by dude1286 and 21 written by FBernkastelKues. These cheevos cover the entire games, both with and without the password systems in play.

# 4) General Approach

No matter how you ended up with your two Game Boy Color games, you will actually want to play on something recognized as a Game Boy Advance. This is to allow for purchasing specific rings later on.

As far as how to play the games, it is best to go in a specific order.

1. Play the first game (your choice on first). Beat it.
2. Copy the password you earn at the end of the first run, and start the second game using that password. Beat it.
3. Copy the password you earn at the end of the second run, and start a new file on the second game with the recently earned password. Beat it.
4. Copy the password you earn at the end of the third run, and start a new file on the first game with the final password. Beat it.

To translate the above into table form:

| First   | Second  | Third   | Fourth  |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| Ages    | Seasons | Seasons | Ages    |
| Seasons | Ages    | Ages    | Seasons |

This guide will assume the first iteration will be used, but both routes are valid. Make adjustments as you need to.

The general goals of each playthrough will be as follows (thanks to {% rauser CassetteCobra %} for the data):

|                      | First      | Second     | Third     | Fourth                           |
| :------------------- | :--------- | :--------- | :-------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Heart Containers** | Avoid      | Collect    | Avoid     | Collect                          |
| **Rings**            | Necessary  | All        | Necessary | All                              |
| **Bosses**           | Damageless | Damageless | Go Wild   | Go Wild (Damageless only at end) |

If some bosses prove to be difficult to deal with damageless, you have a second chance for most bosses when you return to the game for a later playthrough.

Take screenshots of any passwords/secrets you uncover. Spelling mistakes are easy to make.

When going for the no extra heart container runs, remember that the boss door will open without needing to pick them up this time. The heart containers will usually spawn close to the center of the room. There will be a minor graphical effect on the tile the heart container spawns on so you have enough time to move out of the way.

At the time of this writing, there are no cheevos associated with the child that you effectively help raise with the two newlyweds. You can decide how the child grows up.

# 5) RNG Mechanics

These two games introduced the concept of Gacha (or Gasha) to the video game masses, and as such it's important to document how your runtime will be heavily inflated by them. This does technically mean that the Oracle Games are Gacha games way before the concept of Loot Boxes were a thing. Fortunately real money is impossible to spend after acquiring the games themselves.

## The Rings

Each game can have up to 48 rings found within one game. The other 16 rings are found by exchanging Ring Secrets within your playthroughs.

Some rings are found in fixed locations, but 31 rings within each game can be found randomly. There are five classes of rings, with lower classes being easier to obtain than others.

## The Gasha Seeds

Spread throughout Holodrum and Labrynna are Gasha Seeds. They can be won in minigames, bought in stores, and found within treasure chests. To use these items, you must find (and sometimes uncover) dirt patches with soft soil. Place one seed in, destroy 40 enemies, and come back. Usually one or two loops around a dungeon will be enough to cover the quota. When you come back, the gasha seed has become a full tree. Attack the tree with the Sword to claim the Gasha Nut and the treasure held within. These treasures can include the following:

* Hearts for health recovery.
* A fairy.
* A lot of rupees.
* A ring.
* A piece of heart (one time only).

Not all dirt patches are created equally. The easier it is to locate the dirt patch, the lower the classes of rings will be produced if a ring is rolled.

Each game only has two locations that can generate classes 3-5, though keep in mind that Ages only has one of those spots available on an unlinked game.

Pieces of heart can only be generated on a dirt patch that can produce class 4 or class 5 rings. It is possible to get a piece of heart from dirt that generates classes 2-4, but it is not expected.

Gasha Trees can grow twice as fast with the Gasha Ring equipped.

## Maple

Maple will show up on certain overworld tiles after defeating 30 enemies. The music will change to be more obvious and a shadow will appear in the sky. Bumping into her causes a mini-game to start where you try to collect more munitions than she does.

Maple can drop rupees, hearts, bombs, seeds just like you can. She can also uniquely drop rings, healing potions, and pieces of heart! Once you get one piece of heart from Maple, no more will spawn. Be thankful for that because the piece of heart can be a pain to spawn in.

The rings that Maple can drop are in the 2nd and 3rd classes. For other classes, Gasha Seeds are your best bet.

Encountering Maple can be done roughly twice as fast if you have Maple's ring equipped.

# 6) Playthrough

This will be split into four sections, one for each game. Each cheevo will include its title, description, and custom tags to indicate special things.

* Story: You will earn this regardless.
* Bonus: Something that is optional, but can be helpful.
* Challenge: This usually comes with boss challenges or some of the harder collectables.
* Missable: Can this be missed? If so, the markings are placed here.
* Secret: Does this involve exchanging secrets between games?
* Unlinked Only: These cheevos can only be earned on odd playthroughs.
* Linked Only: These cheevos can only be earned on even playthroughs.

## Game 1: Ages Unlinked

The first playthrough will not only be the simplest playthrough to go through, but also potentially the hardest. It is best to get both damageless bosses and no heart containers on this run.

The following cheevos are missble and should be aimed for on this playthrough specifically:
* [Bested Pumpkin Head (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1896)
* [Bested Head Thwomp (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1901)
* [Bested Shadow Hag (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1903)
* [Bested Eyesoar (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1911)
* [Bested Smog (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1917)
* [Bested Octogon (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1921)
* [Bested Plasmarine (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1920)
* [Bested Ramrock (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1924)
* [Bested Veran (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1927)
* [Trial of Time (50)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1928)

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94240.png) [Royal Gift (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1885) _Obtain your sword from Impa._ (Story, Unlinked Only)

This is a freebie: just complete the intro section.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94241.png) [Buying Protection (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1894) _Buy a shield from a local shop in Labrynna and equip it._ (Bonus)

This one only requires you to spare some rupees. Don't forget to equip it after buying! If it is tricky to get all of the required rupees, this can be gotten easily before completing the second dungeon.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94242.png) [Ring Novice (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1887) _Obtain the L-1 ring box from Vasu the Jeweler._ (Bonus)

Here's another freebie: just find the ring shop, and talk to Vasu (the human). The snakes in the pots can be talked to, but will not be of use to you at this stage.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94243.png) [Bested Pumpkin Head (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1896) _Defeat Pumpkin Head without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Use both the Sword and Power Bracelet. Slash enough times and you can then lift up the head to toss onto the spirit. Make sure to dodge the fireballs it launches.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94244.png) [Eternal Spirit (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1897) _Earn the Eternal Spirit from the Spirit's Grave._ (Story)

Simply defeat Pumpkin Head, pick up the Eternal Spirit and this one is yours.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94245.png) [Passing the Time (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1898) _Acquire the Harp of Ages._ (Story)

You'll earn this cheevo while trying to enter the Wing Dungeon.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94246.png) [Bested Head Thwomp (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1901) _Defeat Head Thwomp without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Use both the Roc's Feather and Bombs. You want to throw bombs onto Head Thwomp's...well, head. Try to time it so that the bomb lands when Head Thwomp's color/face is red. Tossing a bomb when the face is not red will cause an attack to spawn. If you delay in throwing a bomb, an attack will launch regardless.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94247.png) [Ancient Wood (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1902) _Earn the Ancient Wood from the Wing Dungeon._ (Story)

Simply defeat Head Thwomp, pick up the Ancient Wood and this one is yours.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94248.png) [Bested Shadow Hag (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1903) _Defeat Shadow Hag without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Use both the Roc's Feather and Seed Shooter. Dodge the splitting shadows. When they start to recombine, face a wall. When Shadow Hag appears behind you, fire the Seed Shooter at the wall and get out of the way! When you are low on ammo, utilize the sword on either the corner bushes or the spawned butterflies.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94249.png) [Echoing Howl (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1904) _Earn the Echoing Howl from the Moonlit Grotto._ (Story)

Simply defeat Shadow Hag, pick up the Echoing Howl and this one is yours.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94250.png) [Friendly Flute (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1908) _Gain access to your animal friend through the use of a flute._ (Story)

This can be earned in one of three ways, and there is no penalty for selecting one over the other. Masteries can be earned regardless of animal friend.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94251.png) [The Current of Time (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1899) _Acquire the Tune of Currents._ (Story)

Utilize your Flippers to find the time researcher, and play the Tune of Echoes. You will learn the Tune of Currents. Make sure to equip the Tune of Currents to have this cheevo pop!

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94252.png) [Bested Eyesoar (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1911) _Defeat Eyesoar without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Use both the Switch Hook and Sword. Get some distance if you can, and fire the Switch Hook at the center eye. This will cause Eyesoar to flip, being vulnerable to the Sword. It is safe to re-grab Eyesoar with the Switch Hook to keep him stunned, and it may be a good idea since you have some invulnerability frames during the actual position swap. If the smaller eyes are getting too close for comfort, consider either the Sword or Roc's Feather, but know that the small eyes will respawn.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94253.png) [Burning Flame (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1904) _Earn the Burning Flame from the Skull Dungeon._ (Story)

Simply defeat Eyesoar, pick up the Burning Flame and this one is yours.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94261.png) [Amended Noble (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1889) _Have the broken sword fixed through the trading sequence._ (Bonus)

This is the soonest that you can earn an upgraded sword, and it's worth grabbing when you can. The steps are as follows:

1. After clearing Level 1, speak to the Friendly Ghost NW of the Spirit's Grave entrance. Take care of their final request to obtain the Poe Clock.
2. Visit Lynna Village and speak to the Postman inside the Post Office. You'll get the Letter Set.
3. Visit the Outhouse/Bathroom in West Lynna Village and give the Letter Set to the hand. You'll get a Stink Bag.
4. While on Crescent Island in the Present time, visit the Tokay in the lower-right hut. You'll receive Tasty Meat restoring their sense of smell.
5. West of the Bridge Switch is the Happy Mask Shop. Feed the owner the Tasty Meat to receive a Doggie Mask.
6. Mamamu Yan in Lynna City has a shy dog. Give her the Doggie Mask to receive a single Dumbbell.
7. The center house in Symmetry Village in the Past has a basement with a man that wants to work out, but only has one Dumbbell. Give him a second one to receive a Cheesy Moustache.
8. Lynna City has a dapper gentleman trying to be funny. Show the Cheesy Moustache and you'll receive a Funny Joke.
9. Go back to Lynna Village and find the house with the depressed boy inside. Tell him the Funny Joke and you'll receive a Touching Book.
10. In either time, trigger an encounter with Maple. Bump into her and instead of the usual item gathering mini-game, you'll drop the Touching Book. She'll give you the Magical Oar.
11. Re-visit Rafton's House with the Magical Oar and you'll receive the Sea Ukulele.
12. Go towards East Lynna Forest. Use the Switch Hook to cross some pits in the area and you'll find a Zora. Give him the Sea Ukulele and get a Broken Sword in exchange.
13. Re-visit Mr. Patch at the top of Restoration Wall. Complete the trap--err, ceremony to finish the trading quest and receive your new sword upgrade!

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94254.png) [Ring Apprentice (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1888) _Obtain an upgraded ring box from the shop's back entrance._ (Bonus)

The Tune of Currents is required for this one. Play at the right location in Lynna Village and you will gain access to the back entrance, where you can purchase this upgrade.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94255.png) [Bested Smog (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1917) _Defeat Smog without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Use the Cane of Somaria and the Sword, though consider the Roc's Feather at the start instead of the Sword. Place the blocks to force the split up Smog back together. Occasionally projectiles will spawn from the mini Smogs, so be prepared to dodge. Upon bringing all of the mini Smogs together, go on the offensive with the Sword. Do be careful: Smog can electrify himself, causing damage to you if you swing too haphazardly. Go through four rounds of this and you are good. If you ever feel you are in a bad situation, the corner button will reset the current round you are in.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94256.png) [Sacred Soil (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1918) _Earn the Sacred Soil from the Crown Dungeon._ (Story)

Simply defeat Smog, pick up the Sacred Soil and this one is yours.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94257.png) [You Make Me Feel Like Dancing (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/82376) _Win the platinum level of hte Goron Dancing minigame without a single fail._ (Bonus)

Platinum difficulty is only available in the past. For those unfamiliar with rhythm games, this may appear daunting. You must get through 8 rounds of dancing, with each dancing typically lasting 7-15 beats. Use the B button for regular beats, A for poses, and nothing when there are intentional breaks. You don't have to maintain the exact BPM, but keep the rhythm as close as you can. Feel free to practice with the easier difficulties to get used to the timing.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94258.png) [Bested Octogon (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1921) _Defeat Octogon without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Use either the Seed Shooter or Sword on the A button slot. Start on the center platform, and wait for Octogon to stop. Attack during his pauses, and prepare the dodge the rocks. Eventually, the battle continues under the water. Attack when you can under water and dodge the fireballs and bubbles that get launched. Patience will be key on this one.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94259.png) [Lonely Peak (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1922) _Earn the Lonely Peak from the Mermaid's Cave._ (Story)

Simply defeat Octogon, pick up the Lonely Peak and this one is yours.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94260.png) [Ageless Tune (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1900) _Acquire the Tune of Ages._ (Story)

Free Nayru and you will earn this tune. Don't forget to equip it to see the cheevo pop!

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94262.png) [Iron Upgrade (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1895) _Have a Tokay give back your shield, except it is not your shield._ (Bonus)

From the Ember Seed Tree in the Past, head all the way south using the Mermaid Suit (you may have to turn east once). Dive down and back up to access a cave where the Tokay gives you the polished shield.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94263.png) [Bested Plasmarine (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1920) _Defeat Plasmarine without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Use the Long Hook on the A button slot. Dodge the initial charge, and wait for an electric spark to be shot out. Use the Look Hook to trade places with Plasmarine and deal damage. Lather, rinse, repeat.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94264.png) [Rolling Sea (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1923) _Earn the Rolling Sea from Jabu Jabu's Belly._ (Story)

Simply defeat Plasmarine, pick up the Rolling Sea and this one is yours.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94265.png) [Bested Ramrock (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1924) _Defeat Ramrock without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Keep one defensive/evasive item equipped regardless. This battle has four phases, the order of which was foreshadowed as you entered the arena.
* Use the Sword to bat back the fists.
* Use the Bomb and have the hands close in on it before it explodes on its own.
* Use the Seed Shooter and target the back of the head. Any seeds will work.
* Use the Power Glove and pull back on the fists long enough until it bounces back.

The rest is just dodging where appropriate.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94266.png) [Falling Star (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1925) _Earn the Falling Star from the Ancient Tomb._ (Story)

Simply defeat Ramrock, pick up the Falling Star and this one is yours.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94272.png) [Bested Veran (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1927) _Defeat all forms of Veran without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

There are three phases to this battle. All must be defeated damageless to earn this cheevo.

* The first form, possessed Ambi, works the same way as possessed Nayru. Use the Seed Shooter with Mystery Seeds and angle your shots. When Veran is stunned, switch to the Long Hook and swap places. One sword swing is enough, and three rounds will move you to phase 2.
* The second form, that of a fairy, is tricky. Consider taking out the Dark Links (mimics) before using your Sword or Seed Shooter to take Veran out. Watch for the energy balls while attacking, and remember that Veran will move faster at roughly half health.
* The third form is a shapeshifting form. Veran will start in a Turtle form, but shift to Spider and Bee forms throughout (and back to Turtle too). Deal enough damage to win.
  * The Turtle will hop around, creating temporary lava pools. Judge the distance, and utilize spin attacks where you can.
  * The Spider form is protected from sword hits at first: use bombs to force Veran to be vulnerable. Be careful of the charge and web attacks.
  * The Bee form is additionally vulnerable to the Seed Shooter. It primarily attacks in a circular or figure 8 pattern. Dodge the stingers if you don't want to be slowed down in battle.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94273.png) [Trial of Time (50)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1928) _Complete the game without increasing your maximum health._ (Challenge, Missable)

It's best to do this one on either Playthrough 1 or Playthrough 3, though it can be done on any playthrough. It won't matter if you start with 3 or 4 heart containers: just don't pick up any containers from boss rooms and don't pick up 4 pieces of heart.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94274.png) [Nayru of Time (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1926) _Rescue the land of Labrynna from the chaos of time._ (Story)

Defeat all of Veran's forms and you will be awarded with this one.

## Game 2: Seasons Linked

On starting this game, you will have the sword in your inventory and a bonus heart container. This will speed up the early game by a few minutes, but this does mean [Heroic Deed](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1802) cannot be earned yet.

Most of the cheevos across both games will be earned in this part due to having to go back and forth between the two games now.

The following cheevos are missble and should be aimed for on this playthrough specifically:
* [Bested Aquamentus (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1806)
* [Bested Dodongo (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1808)
* [Bested Mothula (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1816)
* [Bested Gohma (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1819)
* [Bested Digdogger (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1842)
* [Fukai Mori (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70609)
* [Bested Manhandla (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1853)
* [Bested Gleeok (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1857)
* [Bested Medusa Head (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1874)
* [Pearl Ring (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70613)
* [Bested Onox (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1882)
* [Bested Twinrova (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70616)
* [Bested Ganon (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70617)

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91866.png) [Buying Protection (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1804) _Obtain the Wooden Shield from the shop and equip it._ (Bonus)

While this is intended more for Unlinked games, this one can theoretically be earned if you lose your shield to Like Likes. Don't forget to equip the shield!

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91867.png) [Ring Novice (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1803) _Obtain your first ring case from Vasu._ (Bonus)

Just like in Ages, you will get a ring box from Vasu just by talking to him. Note that you will _not_ get the Friendship Ring on this playthrough, but that is not an issue.

Use your Sword and Roc's Feather. Stay on the platforms, and attack when you are able to. The dangerous attacks include the fireballs and fire swirls.

Simply divine! Impeccably fine! Gorgeous design! Notably kind! Signs!!!

...except you must destroy 100 signs. Step a little away from a sign and slash your sword. You may require the Noble's Sword for that, but by this point the ability to work with the Sword Secret has passed.

Once you destroy all of the required signs, speak with the Sign-Loving Subrosian who will give you the ring. Appraise and equip the ring to earn this one.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91882.png) [Falling All Around (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1846) _Acquire the autumn power for the Rod of Seasons._ (Story)

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91888.png) [Noble Deed (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1809) _Acquire the Noble Sword._ (Bonus)

If you played Seasons first, complete the trading quest and learn how to navigate the Lost Woods to find where this sword is located.

If you played Ages first, this will pop either at the above location or when you bring the upgraded sword secret back to Holodrum. It's recommended to use the sword secret...

As far as the trading sequence itself, perform the following.

1. Visit Mr. left's house in Horon Village and use Ember Seeds to provide light. You'll get the Cuccodex.
2. Take the Cuccodex to Malon at her home to receive the Lon Lon Egg.
3. Bump into Maple and you'll be forced to trade the egg for the Ghastly Doll.
4. Visit Mrs. Ruul in Holodrom Plain to trade the doll for the Iron Bowl.

8. The Grandfather by Impa's place is trying to get his cat down. Give him the fish and he'll give you the Megaphone he tried to use.
9. Immediately west of the Dancing Dragon Dungeon is a cave. Enter it when it's not winter, and use it to wake up Talon. He'll give you a Mushroom.
10. Take the mushroom to Syrup the Witch in Sunken City. You'll receive a Wooden Bird in exchange.
11. The Clock Store in Horon Village will gladly take the bird and give you Engine Grease.
12. Give the Engine Grease to Guru Guru by the Windmill to receive a Phonograph.
13. Before entering the Lost Woods, enter the secret stairs for a deku scrub. It will tell you the path to your new sword.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91915.png) [Fukai Mori (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70609) _Receive the Master Sword in Holodrum's Lost Woods._ (Secret, Missable)

This is the only cheevo where the order of acquiring upgrades matters. The Master Sword will only be in the hidden grove if the Sword Secret is used first. Once that is done, complete the trading quest and access the grove where the Master Sword awaits.

This cheevo will NOT pop if you go to the grove and pick up the Noble Sword first!

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91889.png) [Bested Manhandla (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1853) _Defeat Manhandla without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Use the Feather and Magical Boomerang. If you have the Quicksand Ring, it may also come in handy. Control the boomerang to take out the four faces when they open. Jump around to avoid the projectiles. When the four faces go away, repeatedly attack Manhandla with the boomerang until a core crystal emerges completely. Immediately switch to the sword and attack it once to end this evil.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91890.png) [Blowing Wind (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1854) _Obtain the Blowing Wind from the Ancient Ruins._ (Story)

Finish helping the pirates and bridge, visit a Ghini near the Subrosian Graveyard. You will learn of a new secret.

Switch to Ages, and visit the Master Librarian back in the past. Go through the book maze a second time to receive a shield upgrade.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91891.png) [Bested Gleeok (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1857) _Defeat Gleeok without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Use the Roc's Cape and Sword. Attack the two heads when you can, but beware the fire attacks. Once both heads are defeated, watch out for the second phase. Gleeok can cause earthquakes. Jump to avoid the earthquake, dodge the charge, and land attacks after you get out of the way.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91892.png) [Seed of Life (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1858) _Obtain the Seed of Life from the Explorer's Crypt._ (Story)

This can be completed after getting the Roc's Cape, but it's best to finish the Explorer's Crypt first. Simply complete the cave. Make sure to bring plenty of rupees: the final challenge is pay-to-play. Get the ring to earn this cheevo.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91893.png) [Bested Medusa Head (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1874) _Defeat Medusa Head without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Medusa Head, also known in some circles as Medelock, can be a pain. Use the Roc's Cape and Sword. This battle can be frantic, so attack when you can. The fireballs are relatively simple to dodge. The laser attacks can easily be jumped. The tricky part is the scream attack, which can turn you to stone if you touch any phyiscal part of the scream. If you time your sword swing or spin attack correctly, you can damage Medusa Head while stoned, but it's not recommended unless you have been counting hits.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91894.png) [Changing Seasons (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1877) _Obtain the Changing Seasons from the Sword and Shield Maze._ (Story)

Simply defeat Medusa Head, pick up the Changing Seasons and this one is yours.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91895.png) [Season of Love (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1878) _Complete your life meter to full power._ (Challenge, Linked Only)

We now enter the cheevos that will cause pain. Ten of the pieces of heart are in static locations. The 11th is on the Gasha Trees, and the 12th is on Maple. Refer to the earlier sections for addressing RNG.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91897.png) [Slayer (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1844) _Equip the Slayer Ring to show off your killing capabilities._ (Bonus)

Defeat 1000 enemies in your playthrough, and then talk to Vasu to receive the ring. Don't forget to equip it! If additional kills are necessary, take advantage of the respawning Like Likes in the Lost Woods.

Just so it is clear, kills from prior or future playthroughs do not count.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91898.png) [Rupees! (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1845) _Equip the Rupee Ring to show off your acquired wealth._ (Bonus)

You must collect 10,000 rupees in your playthrough. Any rupees that are "wasted" from having 999 in your wallet still count towards the 10K goal. Consider using the Red Joy Ring and the Shovel to dig up multiple spots. While the Gold Joy Ring also works, using it on this playthrough would disqualify you from a later achievement.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91899.png) [Rings! (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1847) _Equip the 100th Ring to show off your ring collecting abilities._ (Bonus)

You must appraise 100 rings with Vasu. Duplicates are not only allowed, but necessary. The best approach is to go for this while also aiming for the Rupees! cheevo above. Buy more Gasha seeds at the Witch's Hut in Sunken City to accelerate the process.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91918.png) [Pearl Ring (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70613) _Collect every ring in Oracle of Seasons without using a password in a linked game._ (Challenge, Linked Only, Missable)

Have all 48 rings that you can obtain in your linked game playthrough. If any of the other 16 rings are in your possession, the cheevo will not fire. The forbidden rings are as follows (courtesy of [pitapocket17](https://retroachievements.org/user/pitapocket17)):
* Friendship Ring
* Armor Ring L-1
* Armor Ring L-3
* Blue Ring
* GBA Time Ring
* Pegasus Ring
* Heart Ring L-1
* Swimmer's Ring
* Light Ring L-1
* Light Ring L-2
* Bomber's Ring
* Gold Luck Ring
* Snowshoe Ring
* Gold Joy Ring
* Spin Ring
* Victory Ring

There are 22 rings in fixed locations. There are 31 rings that can be randomly rolled for things like Gasha Trees. Five rings are in common within those two groups.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91900.png) [Bested Onox (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1882) _Defeat both forms of Onox without being harmed._ (Challenge, Missable)

Onox has two or three phases depending on how you count the first one.

At first, Onox acts like a giant version of the ball and chain mace knights. Occasionally gale seed attacks will come in as well. Do what you can to attack, but don't be afraid to dodge and wait for a better opportunity to attack.

Partway through, Onox summons Din. If you use your sword against Din, you will be electrocuted. Instead, use the Rod of Seasons to send her away safely. Onox will still attack the same way, so remember to dodge.

The final phase is in a 2D perspective, so equip the Roc's Cape and Sword. Wait for the hands to slam down, then hitch a ride. Do a jumping spin attack on Onox's jewel on his head to deal massive damage. Watch for the fireball attacks and charge attacks. You can try to jump on a hand after a charge attack, but it is risky. Have enough patience and you will be victorious.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91902.png) [Din of the Seasons (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1883) _Rescue Din and save Holodrum from the destruction of the seasons._ (Story)

Simply defeat Onox and this cheevo will be awarded shortly thereafter.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91920.png) [Bested Twinrova (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70616) _Beat both forms of Twinrova without being damaged._ (Challenge, Linked Only, Missable)

The two phases against Koume and Kotake can be tricky to deal with.

For the first phase, you are playing tennis similar to the equivalent battle in [Ocarina of Time](https://retroachievements.org/game/10113). When Koume fires flame magic, use your sword to send it to Kotake. Likewise, when Kotake summons ice magic, send it to Koume. Three or four reflected shots should do, but be ready to dodge if the witches get too close.

For the second phase, the two witches become Twinrova proper. She will shift into a deidcated fire form or ice form. After the shift, attack Twinrova with sword swings and be prepared to dodge the elemental attacks. Eventually Twinrova will lose her specialized form and shift back to normal. At this point, launch a scent seed from your Slingshot. Repeat this a few times to stop the Gerudo witches.

This cheevo will pop at the start of the next battle if you are successful.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91921.png) [A Song of Ice and Fire (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70614) _Beat Twinrova and witness the revival of Ganon._ (Story, Linked Only)

This one is your freebie for defeating the witches.

Equip your Roc's Cape and Sword. Ganon will teleport onto the field and deliver one of five attacks: a triple fireball, a splitting fireball, a charge attack using the trident, an earthquake followed by a fast ball, and a strange blue field that reverses your D-Pad controls. There's usually enough time during the teleporting to charge up a spin attack if you wish, but it's advised to focus more on immediate dodging if the charge attack or blue field attack comes in. You've come this far: you can do it!

This will pop once you exit the arena.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91923.png) [Raison d'Etre (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70615) _Beat the newly revived Ganon and escape with Zelda._ (Story, Linked Only)

After defeating Ganon, approach Zelda and this will pop.

## Game 3: Seasons Unlinked

By this point, you are familiar with both games. Using the Hero Secret, you are ready to go through the journey again, but this time in the reverse order. You start with 4 heart containers instead of three, but this is otherwise the same as a new run. Damageless boss runs are only needed if you missed them on Game 2. Don't forget to not grab heart containers or heart pieces. Only go for the rings you feel you need. The Red Ring may be worth going for.

This particular playthrough will have the fewest achievements earned. The story beats are mostly similar to the linked game, and the few changes you will encounter will not cause major issues. Still, watch for the one missable cheevo below.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91865.png) [Heroic Deed (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1802) _Obtain the Wooden Sword from the Hero's Cave. (Unlinked Only)_ (Story)

Huh: the description covered my normal tagging of cheevos here. Anyway, the Hero's Cave in the Unlinked version is much simpler, and you will be awarded with a Sword in the end.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91901.png) [Trial of Seasons (50)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1884) _Complete the entire game without increasing your maximum health._ (Challenge, Missable)

You've gone through these bosses before. Now do so without losing too much health, and don't pick up the heart containers. You've got this.

## Game 4: Ages Linked

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91908.png) [Dark Cemetary (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70603) _Receive a heart container from the Graveyard in Holodrum._ (Secret, Linked Only)

Complete Spirit's Grave, then head north to see a Ghini outside of the Witch's Hut. Speak to the Ghini to learn a secret.

Switch back to Seasons, and head to the graveyard near the Explorer's Crypt. Dig around the grave that has no flowers by it, and you'll get to play a small mini-game. Simply answer correctly three times in a row to receive your prize.

The only missables to worry about are right at the end with the ring collection and re-visits with Twinrova and Ganon.

After clearing the Spirit's Grave, you'll likely run into a Deku Scrub in the Deku Forest. One of them will give you a secret.

Switch back to Seasons, and head to the Natzu region. Near the entrance to Moblin's Keep is a cave containing another Deku Scrub. Deliver the password, and he'll want you to have filled your Seed Satchel fully with seeds. Max out your seed inventory and the scrub will expand your satchel to contain even more.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94287.png) [Oracle of Secrets (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70594) _Transfer one of your secrets (excluding Ring Secret) back to your linked game._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Simply enter the Maku Tree in the present with one of your newly acquired return secrets, and communicate the secret of traveling through time to Farore. You'll receive a cheevo for this.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91912.png) [Temple From the Within (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70604) _Obtain Heart Ring L-1 from the Great Fairy in the Temple of Seasons._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Complete the Wing Dungeon, then return to this area in the present time. A Great Fairy will have a secret for you.

Switch to Seasons, and enter the Temple of Seasons where you got the Rod of Seasons. Enter the Waterfall of Seasons (alright, enough being silly) and speak to that Great Fairy to receive the Heart Ring L-1.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91907.png) [The Mayor of Simpleton (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70605) _Obtain a Ring Box upgrade from the mayor of Holodrum's Horon Village._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Complete the Wing Dungeon, then enter Mayor Plen's House. You'll find that Plen's Grandmother is around, and she has a secret for you.

Switch to Seasons, and enter Mayor Ruul's house. Give him the new secret and you'll have an expanded ring box.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91905.png) [Cursed Pirates of the Sea (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70611) _Obtain a bomb upgrade from the Piratian in Subrosia._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Complete the Wing Dungeon, then head to Rafton's House. From there, go north one and west one to find a lady who has a secret for you.

Head back to Seasons and enter the House of Pirates back in Subrosia. There will be a skeleton pirate that receives the password. In order to earn the reward, however, you must have 777 Ore Chunks in your possession. The best way to earn ore chunks is to use the shovel and start digging. Consider grabbing the Green Joy Ring: it's in a fixed location and not random, and will make the grind easier. Show the ore chunks in your possession and you'll get your upgrade.

If for some reason you need 777 exactly, you can always spend at the Subrosian Market.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94285.png) [Stranger in the Desert (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70588) _Meet up with a familiar face in Labrynna._ (Story, Linked Only)

This will be awarded automatically when you recover the first of your lost gear on Crescent Island. Just...don't ask how she traveled to the past.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94286.png) [25m (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70591) _Rescue Zelda in the Black Tower._ (Story, Linked Only)

After recovering from your first trip to Crescent Island, head to the Black Tower in the present. You'll be informed that Zelda was captured and placed there. Enter, and...well, it's a sdie scrolling area similar to Donkey Kong. Just reach where Zelda is located and you will receive the cheevo and a ring.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91903.png) [Clockwork Groove (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70621) _Receive a sword upgrade from the man living beneath the Clock Shop in Horon Village._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Complete the Skull Dungeon, then head to the Ember Seed Tree just south of Lynna City. An Old Woman will have a secret for you.

Switch to Seasons, and dig around the Clock Shop to find a secret staircase. You are challenged to defeat a number of enemies in a short time. Do so and the sword upgrade is yours.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91909.png) [Forged in Iron - Crowned in Steel (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70623) _Obtain the Biggoron's Sword from Holodrum's Goron Mountain._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Complete the Crown Dungeon, then enter the new passageway to East Rolling Ridge. If you head left, there should be a cave containing a lone Goron. He has a secret for you.

Switch to Seasons, and visit Biggoron. Deliver the secret and you'll receive Biggoron's Sword.

If he is still under the weather, complete the trading sequence up to and including giving him Lava Soup first.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91910.png) [Drop Da Bomb (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70624) _Receive Bombchus from the golden Subrosian._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Complete the Crown Dungeon, then explore the newly available caves. Some Subrosians have decided to visit, and one of them has a secret for you.

Switch to Seasons, and enter a cave in the Subrosia Volcanoes. There should be a bunch of random grass inside along with a new Subrosian. Give them the password and you'll be challenged to cut the grass in three attacks. Use the Magical Boomerang to great effect and you'll receive Bombchus.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91904.png) [Shield of Faith (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70622) _Give a password to the Subrosian Smith brothers to receive a secret shield upgrade._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Complete the Crown Dungeon, then warp to the Mystery Seed Tree in Rolling Ridge. A Subrosian will give you a secret.

Switch to Seasons, and head to the Subrosian Smithery. The master will request the password, so deliver it to receive a free shield upgrade.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91911.png) [Aquatic Interlude (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70625) _Obtain the Swimmer's Ring in the Sunken City._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Complete Mermaid's Cave, then head to Zora Village as normal. A Dive Master will be around, and he has a secret for you.

Switch to Seasons, and head back to Sunekn City. The Master Diver will, upon receiving the secret, challenge you to a swimming game. Complete within 30 seconds to receive the Swimmer's Ring.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94268.png) [I'm Slimey! (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1919) _Equip a ring to become a Like Like._ (Bonus)

This ring is a Class 1 RNG ring, but a guaranteed instance of this ring is available in Jabu Jabu's Belly.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94288.png) [Heart of Limestone (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70618) _Complete the Hero's Cave in Oracle of Ages._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Hero's Cave only spawns on a Linked Game, next to the Maku Path. You'll need the Long Hook to complete this dungeon comfortably, but once you do you'll be awarded with this cheevo.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94267.png) [Time for Love (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1919) _Obtain all heart containers scattered throught Labrynna._ (Challenge, Linked Only)

Similar to Seasons, there are 10 fixed locations for pieces of heart and two RNG pieces of heart in the Gashe Trees and Maple. Maple in this game sticks to the northern half of the world in both time periods, so keep that in mind.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94269.png) [Slayer (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1890) _Equip the ring that shows off your killing potential._ (Bonus)

It may be possible to encounter this during your unlinked game, but it's more likely to see this during the second playthrough. Should it matter, it is possible to receive this ring without grinding too much.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94270.png) [Rupees! (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1891) _Equip a ring that shows off your collected wealth._ (Bonus)

This one is easier to get than the Seasons counterpart due to having access to multiple mini games where rupees can be a prize. As such, searching for big rupees with the Shovel is not as necessary. Rhythm gamers may find Goron Dancing Bronze difficulty to be more profitable than most.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94271.png) [Rings! (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/1892) _Equip a ring that shows off your collector's side._ (Bonus)

Similar with the Rupees with the cheevo above, the mini-games help with getting you enough money to buy Gasha seeds. However, you don't even need rupees for that: the Goron Dancing game offers Gasha seeds for perfection on Silver and Gold difficulties. For those that struggle with rhythm mini games, the same methods in Seasons can be used for getting your 100 rings.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94289.png) [Diamond Ring (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70619) _Collect every ring in Oracle of Ages without using a password in a linked game._ (Bonus, Linked Only, Missable)

Similar to Seasons, you have 31 random rings to find alongside 17 more around the world. This game, however, has more mini-games, and thus more opportunities for rings in comparison to Seasons: 13 of the random rings are available elsewhere. The rings you do NOT want are the following:
* Friendship Ring
* Power Ring L-3
* Armor Ring L-3
* Red Ring
* Blast Ring
* Rang Ring L-1
* Steadfast Ring
* Heart Ring L-1
* Swimmer's Ring
* Snowshoe Ring
* Green Joy Ring
* Subrosian Ring
* Spin Ring
* GBA Nature Ring
* Victory Ring
* Sign Ring

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94290.png) [Platinum Ring (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70620) _Complete your ring collection in either game._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

While this can technically be done in an unlinked game, it's intended to earn this one on a linked game. This cheevo assumes you have earned Pearl Ring and Diamond Ring already.

* Go to your first playthrough save game (Ages), and enter Vasu's. Appraise any rings you haven't already: you may have the two rings from previous secrets. Speak to the Red Snake, and ask for the ring secret.
* Switch to your second playthrough save game (Seasons), and re-enter Vasu's. Tell that Red Snake the ring secret you learned, and you will receive the rings from that file. There is no need to appraise a second time: they just arrive fully ready to go. Now speak to the Red Snake again, and ask for the new ring secret.
* Switch to your third playthrough save game (Seasons), and re-enter Vasu's. Appraise the two rings from previously gained secrets if you haven't already. State the new secret to the Red Snake, and gain all of the rings so far. Ask for one more new ring secret.
* Switch to your fourth playthrough save game (Ages), and re-enter Vasu's. Tell the Red Snake the ring secret, and you should have every ring possible.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/91919.png) [Platinum Ring (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70626) _Complete your ring collection in either game._ (Bonus, Linked Only)

Of course, you aren't done with Vasu's yet. Immediately after getting Platnium Ring on Ages, ask for one more ring secret. Take it to either Seasons game playthrough, and communicate with the Red Snake one more time. Deliver the secret and the full ring collection is in that game too. Congrats: Seasons is now mastered!

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94291.png) [Bested Twinrova (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70599) _Beat both forms of Twinrova without being damaged._ (Challenge, Linked Only, Missable)

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94292.png) [A Song of Ice and Fire (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70597) _Beat Twinrova and witness the revival of Ganon._ (Story, Linked Only)

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94293.png) [Bested Ganon (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70600) _Beat the newly revived Ganon without being damaged._ (Challenge, Linked Only, Missable)

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/94294.png) [Raison d'Etre (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/70598) _Beat the newly revived Ganon and escape with Zelda._ (Story, Linked Only)

The four above cheevos act the same as Seasons, with only minor equipment changes on your end. You will have the Seed Shooter instead of the Slingshot for Twinrova, and only the Roc's Feather instead of the Roc's Cape. To make up for this, you now have every ring available to you. Go with what you feel is right, and take the right to the Gerudo.
