## Hash Compatibility Testing

The QA-team is happy to announce a new process for hash compatibility testing! This allows users to help test hash compatibility for existing sets. You can work with the developer on testing new hashes while mastering the set to verify compatibility.

More information can be found in the docs at [Player Compatibility Testing](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/player-compatibility-testing.html).
