Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up.

We start off today's edition conveniently with a magazine cover, this time being for Ultra Game Players! It features our favourite Italian Plumber, kart racing through a winter wonderland and being greeted by a very big snowman.

In today's episode of unlikely crossovers, we have Chuck Rock from the hit game Chuck Rock™ meet up with Ty the Tasmanian Devil from Ty the Tasmanian Devil™. Will the wild devil be understand the caveman's language, or will he chuck a rock at him instead?

And we have another magazine cover with internetghost's rendition of the 3DO Club Magazine, featuring three characters watching the TV playing the console who are probably happy not to be part of the console's history!

If you wanted more 3DO Club Magazine covers then crrool has you covered, with their rendition also featuring three characters watching the TV, all from the Mario series! I mean realistically people would probably rather read about them than the 3DO but who am I.

The Mortal Kombat roster has expanded itself, this time with everyone's favourite mature series character... Snoopy! Yeah bet you didn't see that one coming. But with him on his way to murder Subzero, it looks like he would make an excellent fighter. Just... please don't kill the dog.

And for another character we have... a leech man? And apparently he ate Sonic, which the colour of his clothes represent? Huh. Well, at least that saves me from talking about Sonic this issue, and that's good enough for me!

You know what those fishing games need? A story about a guy wanting to destroy the world, that's what! And who better would that be than the myth, the legend, Evil Fisherman? Yeah watch out, he's dangerous; his fishing skills will destroy everyone.

Just like everyone else, the Tetronimoes also need to go out and buy some groceries. Just uh, it's probably best they don't all go at once if they want to prevent merging together and dissolving before they can even finish their shopping... Oh wait, too late.
