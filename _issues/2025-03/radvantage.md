| {% raachpic 4656, 144989, Dry-bones Dance-off! %} | Earn 10 1-Ups in a row from the 3 Dry-bones in World 2 Fortress | 25     |

The Dry-bones Dance-off! achievement in Super Mario Bros. 3 presents a fun challenge that requires the player to utilize finesse, memory, muscle, and rhythm. Earn ten 1-Ups in a row by stomping the three Dry Bones in the World 2 Fortress. First, check out the video to see this in action:

Now that you see how this is done, my personal tips may provide the "ah-ha!" that I, too, learned as I earned this achievement.

### Enter the level wearing the Tanooki suit

Seems obvious. It might be tricky to make it there wearing that suit. If you have a power that you can use before entering the level to make Mario full size, use it. Fire flower, mushroom, etc. Why? Did you know that the pipe that takes you up a level can also take you back down to the starting floor? Yeah! I entered the level wearing the Tanooki suit, I screwed up and got hit, losing the Tanooki but SMB 3 is generous, unlike SMB 1. Lose the Tanooki but stay full size! I went up to the next floor, found a block that gave me a leaf, and I was back in the Tanooki suit. Backtrack to the pipe, go down to the starting floor, and make your way to the three Dry Bones section.

### Lure the three foes near to each other

Duh.

### Hold jump

Know how in other platforms you need to press the jump button again as soon as you make contact with an enemy to get a height boos on bounce-off? SMB 1, you need to do that with a spring, for example. In SMB 3, you can continue holding the jump button after initially pressing it, land on an enemy while still holding the jump button, and get launched high! I didn't know this before going for this achievement. Makes it much easier to get full height from a bounce-off. At the peak height when bouncing off of the first Dry Bones, release the jump button then begin tapping it to flap tail, float down. Land on whatever Dry Bones re-forms, remember to hold jump after connecting with it, then repeat.

Bonus, this also qualifies for the Evergreen AOTW 2015. Good luck!
