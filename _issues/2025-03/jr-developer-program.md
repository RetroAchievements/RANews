| ⭐    | {% ragamepic 31371, 107289, Pass the Pigs: Let the Good Swines Roll! %} | {% rauserpic Landa %} | {% rauserpic RyCuLe %} | 2/18/2025    |

Pass the Pigs: Let the Good Swines Roll! is a video game adaptation of the dice game Pass the Pigs. The gameplay insists of rolling pig shaped dice and carefully banking your score without Pigging Out and losing all your points for that turn. It's a silly, quick, fun game with humor, wacky designs, and it's very easy to understand. The set as well is fairly simple, the "hardest" achievement being to roll all of the high scoring rolls. If you enjoy simple chill games, you should enjoy this one.

| ⭐    | {% ragamepic 7429, 106586, SteamGear Mash %} | {% rauserpic lizstar %} | {% rauserpic cdpowe %} | 2/19/2025    |

Remember when a good character design could just be 2D orb made to look like it's 3D? Steamgear Mash is an isometric platforming metroidvania, and a true hidden gem on the console. Jump, shoot, explore, and blast your way to saving your kidnapped sister! Control the robot Mash and take on a variety of fun challenges for you to test your metal (get it? "metal" sounds like mettle)

|      | {% ragamepic 6726, 047424, The Adventures of Lomax %} | {% rauserpic CopperMoon %} | {% rauserpic scatter %} | 2/20/2025    |

The adventures of Lomax is a surprisingly unknown game despite being a Lemmings spin-off. The visuals are genuinely gorgeous and worth a play just to appreciate all the wonderful scenery! The gameplay's not too shabby either, allowing you to skip the more tricky platforming with power-ups if you ration them well. Take on the action and restore peace to Lemmingland, and maybe even rescue a few Lemmings along the way.

"Free Points"? YOUUUUUU GOT IT! At long last, the companion game for Mario Clock! It may just be a calculator, but 11 achievements await you in this meme set for the ages. Sit back, press A to jump (not that it does anything...), and most of all, have FuN wItH nUmBeRs!

|      | {% ragamepic 16652, 075841, Shrek Treasure Hunt %} | {% rauserpic rushmush %} | {% rauserpic authorblues %} | 2/21/2025    |

Shrek Treasure Hunt's game-play mostly comprises of hub world with light platforming, collectathon elements and several mini-games. Even though it came out well after the PS1 was released the game is a bit of a mess. The stiff controls, terrible camera, and poor frame rate make for at best a janky if not completely frustrating experience at times. While it does have all these problems if you are a Shrek fan and have a few hours, somebody once told me there's a little something here for everybody to enjoy.

If you're looking for a solid, classic 2D platformer, FX Unit Yuki: The Henshin Engine is here for you! With 8 stages that reference classic games, such as Castlevania, Monster Lair and more, and a variety of power-ups to help you on your adventure, and no shortage of interesting challenges, will you have what it takes to master this game?
