## Spot the Difference

While traveling to an unknown source of energy Sonic and Tails get sucked into a hurricane, causing them to land on an unknown island somewhere in the ocean. To their surprise, it seems like the hurricane was some kind of portal to another dimension which is slightly altered. Can you find all 10 differences between both dimensions?
