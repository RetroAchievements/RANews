## Intro

We are going to take a look at another metric for greatness, Mastery Awards. Mastery awards are given to users when they complete every achievement for a given set in hardcore mode. Users wear mastery awards as a badge of honor on their profile page representing all the hard work they put into truly becoming a master of the game.

Below we will take a look at which users rank among the best with the most mastery awards in several categories well as notable updates from the previous month to each individual category. Check to see how you rank among the rest of the community members.

Special thanks to {% rauserpic Nydaxn %} for creating the ranking images.

### Updates

- We have decided to remove ~Hack~ mastery awards from the individual leaderboards given that they have their own leaderboard.
- There will now be two Total leaderboards, one including hacks and one excluding hack.
- Events Leaderboard will now be featured each month.
- The Current Champions list below will now include all supported consoles, giving recognition to those who have the most mastery awards for some of the consoles with only a few achievement sets.
