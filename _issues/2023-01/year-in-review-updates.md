# Developer Rule & Policy Updates

<!-- ## Rule Updates
* Sudoku/Picross Scoring Update. "1 point for easy, 2-3 points for medium, 4-5 points for hard"
* Logic backups required by developers when updating achievements that are not their own.
* Set icons should be representative of the game and its common themes, and therefore should be instantly recognizable.
* `Bonus`, `Multi`, and `Subset` naming conventions updated to `[Bonus]` rather than `~Bonus~`.
* Unfinished sets should stay in unofficial until finished. Sets that fail to cover the content to at least game completion would fall under this rule.
* Bonus sets are to be treated like revisions and will require and set plan and vote in #revision-voting, unless release alongside and existing set claim. If a junior developer wants to publish a bonus set alongside a core set, they need to have their plan approved by code reviewers.
* Changing the description to clarify or correct it to match the logic that is already present does NOT require a revision vote.
* Altering the achievement's objective in any way does require a revision vote as always.
* Leaderboard edits or entry removals must now come with a comment from the developer to avoid ambiguity as to the nature of a change or reason for an entry removal that's not their own.
* Do not declare your plans to work on a game if you have unaddressed tickets. A ticket is considered as addressed when the developer acknowledged the ticket, commented on it explaining the situation but is unable to resolve the problem immediately due to reasons such as waiting for saves states or more information from the reporter.
* New rules on [Editing Leaderboards](https://docs.retroachievements.org/Developers-Code-of-Conduct/#editing-leaderboards).
* If a fellow developer has already started to handle a ticket thru action that can be proved with comment of intent, leave it to them. The user would be given a time of 7 days to handle the ticket after comment.
* Softcore ticket handling updates:

```
Does the achievement have hits?
If Yes > Verify what current version of RetroArch are they using. 
If 1.9.1  or newer > Ticket handling is the same as a hardcore ticket being submitted

If prior to 1.9.1 or DuckStation Standalone> Investigate like normal.
It IS possible that the achievement could have not triggered due to
save-state abuse, but is still important to check.

If there are no hits > Ticket handling is the same as a hardcore ticket being submitted.
```
* Professor Oak Subsets no longer require approval.
* Reminder to make a new post when reclaiming a set, don't just update the original claim post.
* Ability to hold a finished set in unofficial for a future event, or holiday without it taking a claim spot. Must be approved by QA Team.
* Sole/Majority devs can now request forum topic transfers so they can now be the author of the first post and can edit it freely. -->

## Policy Updates
<!-- * Updates
  * _DevCoC - Reservation + Ticket Handling_
    * `"Open tickets" was changed to "Unaddressed Tickets" + additional info`
  * _Docs - Achievement Set Revisions - When Making a Revision_
    * `Resolve any open tickets for achievements that will be kept in the set. Tickets for achievements that are being demoted can simply be closed with the demotion cited. In cases where the revision is simply the demotion of one or more achievements, the developer does not need to handle the tickets for other achievements in the set.`
  * _Docs - Icon Gauntlet_
    * `Updated Discord Template`
* Changes
  * _DevCoC - Unwelcome Concepts_
    * `12. Sets for compilations featuring games that share the same console as the compilation. An example of this is 6-Pak for Genesis/Mega Drive, which contains six Genesis/Mega Drive games.`
  * _Docs - Respecting Revision Plans_
    * `If you are one of or the original set developer(s) for a set that is currently undergoing a revision, you must communicate with the developer carrying out the revision before making changes to the set. This is to prevent potential extra work for the revision, overlapping or redundant changes, etc.`
  * _Docs - Icon Gauntlet - No Need for Approval_
    * `5. You are one of the existing set's original developers as part of a collaborative set, all parties agree to the change, and no other developer has changed the icon/badge(s).`
* Removals
  * _DevCoC - Reservation Limit_
    * `8 claim limit for Veteran Devs. It was voted on to be removed a while back, but was not changed in the docs until the Veteran Developer badge was ready.` -->

# Artists
<!-- The new Discord @Art-Helper role was created to help aid developers with their set icons and badges. Developers can make art requests in #art-requests channel. The Artists have worked on 2 boxart requests, 14 badge requests, and 29 icon requests this year. Here is the current Artist team:

| {% rauserpic ArcaneJames %}   | {% rauserpic Ch0senlast %}     | {% rauserpic GalacticSpear %} |

# Code Reviewers & Junior Developers
<!-- The Junior Developer program is responsible for aiding and assisting aspiring achievement sets developers as they try to earn the rank of a full developer. New this year is the much needed and requested [Junior Developer site role](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=13332). This new role allows Junior Developers access to several site features, that were previously Developer only.

# Development Tool Updates

After the number, any number of whitespace characters and/or a single non-alphanumeric character separate the indirect note from the offset.

* [Version 1.10.0](https://github.com/Jamiras/RATools/releases/tag/v1.10.0) - Released on 1/14/2022
  * new internal representation of logic
    * small performance boost due to not having to reevaluate on each usage
    * allows for more optimization opportunities
    NOTE: this causes errors to be generated for several previously allowed syntaxes:
      * implicit `always_true()` and `always_false()` are no longer supported in logic chains. logic 
        such as: `0=1 && never(byte(0x1234) == 3)` will now collapse to `false` as `0=1` can never be
        true. script authors must replace the `0=1` with an `always_false()` to preserve the logic in
        the output.
      * `always_true()` and `always_false()` are no longer supported for leaderboard values. 
        use `measured(repeated(0, always_true()))` and `0` instead.
      * memory addresses can no longer be compared to `true` or `false`. Compare to `1` or `0` instead.
      * integer division is no longer implicitly converted to floats for leaderboard values:
        `byte(0x1234) * 3 / 2` will no longer be automatically converted to `byte(0x1234) * 1.5`.
        use `byte(0x1234) * 3.0 / 2` for automatic conversion.
      * calling `repeated` or `tally` with a count of 0 is no longer supported outside of a `measured`
        clause of a value expression. Doing so implies an unbounded hit requirement which cannot be
        reached and is equivalent to `always_false()`. Using these to generate an AndNext/OrNext chain
        was not intended. If you absolutely want to prevent the OrNext from being converted to alt groups
        use the `__ornext(condition)` function. If you have a valid reason for forcing an AndNext chain
        let me know.
      * `measured(A && B)` will now generate an error instead of just setting the Measured flag on B.
        The actual logic it previously generated was `A && measured(B)` or `measured(repeated(0, A && B))`
        depending on whether it was being used in a trigger expression or a value expression.
      * `once(A && once(B))` will now keep a separate hit count for B and for the entire clause by
        reordering the conditions or injecting an `always_false()` condition to hold the total count.
      * `once(unless(A))` will now generate an error. use `unless(once(A))` or `disable_when(A)` instead.
        Similarly, `unless` cannot be used inside `repeated` or `tally` clauses.
      * `repeated(10, trigger_when(A))` will now generate an error. use `trigger_when(repeated(10, A))` instead.
