# Developer Rule & Policy Updates
* [Subset Rule](https://docs.retroachievements.org/Subsets/) Updates

```
- Naming scheme for Bonus and Multi sets. Instead of [Bonus] and [Multi], they
 should be [Subset - Bonus] and [Subset - Multi].

- The list of pre-approved Subsets has expanded. Before it was just
"Professor Oak Challenge," but now includes the following:
- Bonus/Multi
- DLC/Expansions
- Glitch Showcases
- Regional Differences
- Low Level Games/No Leveling Runs
- Solo Class/Monotype Runs
- Checkpoint Challenges (such as POC)
- Perma-Death Challenges

Other challenge run ideas (such as Rare Drops) will still need to be approved.
 The pre-approved list will likely continue to expand as more Subsets are made.

- Claims
Before: Bonus/Subsets would not need to be claimed if published alongside a
 base set. If published later, they would require a revision vote and
 count as a claim. That has been abolished to be more in line with revisions.

Now: Subsets will not count as a claim and do not require votes if the dev
 is the sole author of the base set. Otherwise, they will need to post a
 plan in the forum and have it approved via revision voting.
```

* [Developer Inactivity](https://docs.retroachievements.org/Developers-Code-of-Conduct/#expiration-of-developer-status) Updates

```
If a developer is inactive for six months or longer, meaning within six
 months they have not created any new achievements or resolved any incoming
 tickets, their developer status will expire.

If this happens to you, you are very welcome to come back to the scene if
 you want to create new content for our community. First, you'll want to
 review and understand this document (the Developer Code of Conduct).
 When you feel ready to adhere to it, message us to user RAdmin here
 on site or speak to the admin or mod users on the RetroAchievements
 Discord server to check how to get your developer status back.
```

* [Set Plagiarism](https://docs.retroachievements.org/Set-Plagiarism/) Rule Introduced
* Rules updated to reflect new Developer Set Claim system.
* Reservation Renewals
  * Added details about the progress reports requirements.
  * Adjusted of the cooldown after denied progress reports (from 3 months to 1 month) to align with the "drop and resume before 1 month" rule.
  * Added the requirement to post progress reports after every renewal if a 1-month cooldown happened.

# Moderation
Thanks to the Moderation team for keeping the RA Discord Server a kind, enjoyable and welcoming place for all the users. Moderating a server with nearly 6,000 users can be difficult at times with heated arguments, clash of opinions, and internet trolls. It can sometimes seem like a thankless job and may require an insane amount of self-control to diffuse heated situations. Your dedication to keeping the server as safe, positive, and enjoyable as it can be is very appreciated.

Thank you for everything you do.

# Code Reviewers & Junior Developers
The Junior Developer program is responsible for aiding and assisting aspiring achievement sets developers as they try to earn the rank of a full developer. The program is always growing and improving on to meet the needs of the users interested in creating achievements. Reviews are now being completed in their own threads in the `#jr-dev-forum` channel to reduce clutter in the main channel, this channel also tutorial and guides created by the Code Reviewer team, a new voice channel has been created for additional help, site permissions have been updated to allow Junior Developers more control over their sets without needed to ping Code Reviewers for simple tasks like updating box arts. This year the team had nearly 150 new Junior Developers join the program, almost 200 reviews being completed, and promoted almost 50 new Developers.

# Discord Updates
Discord is a main area for communication and work in the RetroAchievements community. Here are some of the updates and role/channel additions that have occurred over the past year.

* Icon Gauntlet rule updates
  1. `@Art-Helper` will be responsible for uploading any changes to badges or icons that pass through the gauntlet
     - If you are an active developer and wish to help finalize icon-gauntlet results, please DM {% rauser gollawiz %} for our contribution tracking Google Sheet. You will need to verify and finalize your results there.
  2. 24 hour cooldown on repeat gauntlets
     - 24 hours must pass before submitting the same game to the icon-gauntlet. Note: Achievement badges and game icons are considered separate and may be run alongside each other. Future gauntlets are still subject to the 24 hour rule.
  3. Updates to your gauntlet
     - If you have any mistakes in your current gauntlet, let `@Art-Helper` know. Your original poll will be deleted and you must re-poll for accurate results.
  4. Multiple Icons
     - Completed Gauntlets for multiple images in the same set must be labeled according to the order they appear in the achievement list. (Do NOT use the achievement ID) A .zip for the badges must then be posted in the “Icon Gauntlet Uploads” thread found in gauntlet-discussion.
* We had several channels transition into forum channels, allowing users to create forum topics for their issues or requests. This reduces clutter in the channel and makes it easier to track issues or requests without them getting lost.
* ClaimBot and HashBot were created to auto log Developer Set Claim actions and Hash unlinks. Making it easier to track that information without needed to search the site for it.
* PlaytestBot was created to ping the Playtest team anytime a new set is ready for playtesting.
* Staff role was dissolved in favor of the several teams that now take care of the various projects and efforts.

# Development Tool Updates
Without the work of {% rauserpic Jamiras %} we would still be stuck in the stone age of achievement development and toolkit features. There are no amount of words that express the appreciation and gratitude that we all have for all the time and effort he puts into this community. Check out the major updates to development tools and emulators that he has provided this year.

  If the first line of a code note contains the keyword "pointer", then any following line that starts with a plus (no indent) immediately followed by a number (hexadecimal [0x prefix] or decimal, no whitespace) is treated as an indirect code note. After the number, any number of whitespace characters and/or a single non-alphanumeric character separate the indirect note from the offset. Following lines that don't start with a plus are also considered part of the indirect note. Some examples are shown [here](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAIntegration/pull/902#issuecomment-1180878607).

* [Version 1.10.0](https://github.com/Jamiras/RATools/releases/tag/v1.10.0) - Released on 1/14/2022
  * new internal representation of logic
    * small performance boost due to not having to reevaluate on each usage
    * allows for more optimization opportunities
    NOTE: this causes errors to be generated for several previously allowed syntaxes:
      * implicit `always_true()` and `always_false()` are no longer supported in logic chains. logic 
        such as: `0=1 && never(byte(0x1234) == 3)` will now collapse to `false` as `0=1` can never be
        true. script authors must replace the `0=1` with an `always_false()` to preserve the logic in
        the output.
      * `always_true()` and `always_false()` are no longer supported for leaderboard values. 
        use `measured(repeated(0, always_true()))` and `0` instead.
      * memory addresses can no longer be compared to `true` or `false`. Compare to `1` or `0` instead.
      * integer division is no longer implicitly converted to floats for leaderboard values:
        `byte(0x1234) * 3 / 2` will no longer be automatically converted to `byte(0x1234) * 1.5`.
        use `byte(0x1234) * 3.0 / 2` for automatic conversion.
      * calling `repeated` or `tally` with a count of 0 is no longer supported outside of a `measured`
        clause of a value expression. Doing so implies an unbounded hit requirement which cannot be
        reached and is equivalent to `always_false()`. Using these to generate an AndNext/OrNext chain
        was not intended. If you absolutely want to prevent the OrNext from being converted to alt groups
        use the `__ornext(condition)` function. If you have a valid reason for forcing an AndNext chain
        let me know.
      * `measured(A && B)` will now generate an error instead of just setting the Measured flag on B.
        The actual logic it previously generated was `A && measured(B)` or `measured(repeated(0, A && B))`
        depending on whether it was being used in a trigger expression or a value expression.
      * `once(A && once(B))` will now keep a separate hit count for B and for the entire clause by
        reordering the conditions or injecting an `always_false()` condition to hold the total count.
      * `once(unless(A))` will now generate an error. use `unless(once(A))` or `disable_when(A)` instead.
        Similarly, `unless` cannot be used inside `repeated` or `tally` clauses.
      * `repeated(10, trigger_when(A))` will now generate an error. use `trigger_when(repeated(10, A))` instead.
      * `repeated(10, measured(A))` will now generate an error. use `measured(repeated(10, A))` instead.
  * support for local code notes
  * add Progression analysis dialog (open from Game Stats dialog)
  * add ability to autogenerate function names in New Script dialog
  * fix "measured(bitcount(X) == 8)" being converted to "measured(byte(X) == 255)"

  * fix "float(X) < 0" being converted to "always_false()"
