## The guide

Written by [Sines](https://retroachievements.org/user/Sines), don't hesitate to ping me if you see mistakes in this guide. 

This guide is an extended and more explicit version of what was initially my routing notes. Everything has been personally tested by me and should be replicable by following the notes. **This is not a play-by-play walkthrough**, the goal is to cover all the achievements, provide a single playthrough route to obtain them and explain the more obscure sub-systems. 

While exploration is rewarded, for achievement hunting purpose everything can be obtained in one playthrough with a couple of backup saves at key points.  After finishing the set, my RA playtime is around 40h but please take into account that I wasted time testing various things and that I play with speed-up mode a lot.

As I cover quite a lot in this guide already, [Single playthrough completionist routing](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki/Ogre-Battle:-March-of-the-Black-Queen-Routing) is on it's own page. 

## About the game

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/82063/2583372-obtmotbq.jpg" />
</p>
Ogre Battle March of the Black Queen is a 1993 Tactical RPG initially released on SNES with later ports to the PlayStation and Saturn. For Tactical RPG enthusiast it should be quite an intriguing prospect: it's the start of the "Ogre" video game series that would birth Tactics Ogre one year later and pave the way for the titan Final Fantasy Tactics.

The game appeal comes from the fact that there is almost nothing else like it in term of gameplay, a game where you direct your troops like a RTS but also have full customization of your units composition and almost no direct way of controlling the battle flow once it start.  With 13 endings depending on your actions and the myriads of secrets, there is a lot to cover !

## Listing
Achievements can be roughly be divided in 5 categories
- **Maps**: 32 Achievements that require you to beat most maps while having liberated every towns and temple. Often require you to trigger at least one of the unique boss interaction when available. As you can only beat a map once, *30 are missables*
- **Recruitment**: 13 Achievements for recruiting various story characters. Apart from 3, *they are all missables*
- **Items**: 31 Achievements for finding items. *17 are missables.*
- **Endings**: 10 Achievements giving you an ending card depending on how you played. Because this is a nicely designed set, gender variant of the same ending are covered in a single achievement. Technically all missables except two if you save before the final battle by having a low reputation.
- **Misc**: 7 remaining achievements. *4 of them are missables*

## Systems and sub-systems
Because they are often the biggest pain point for new player, here are explanations on the major game sub-systems.

### Reputation
Represented by the gauge on the top right of the screen during battle. Overall It is easier to lower it than to raise it. High is 2/3 or more, Low is 1/3 or less and Medium is in-between.

**Things that raise reputation:**

-   Liberating towns with a High ALI unit
-   In-game events (be nice to people)
-   Random card draws after liberation

**Things that lower reputation:**

-   Having a liberated town/temple taken back by enemies
-   Liberating towns with a Low ALI unit.
-   Taking too long to finish a map (you collect taxes every day, idling make you look tyrannical) . This is also true if you revisit a map after battle but the timer is reset to 0.
-   Getting your HQ captured
-   In-game events (don’t be nice to people or do bad things)
-   Random card draws after liberation

Your reputation impact quite a lot of things such as Endings, recruitments and getting items so pay attention to it. Overall for the completionism making sure you liberate towns with a high ALI unit and don't have your towns/temple retaken. Card draw is RNG dependent but shouldn't affect you to the point where you get screwed over just by it. 

When you need to lower your reputation quickly you can repeatedly let the enemy retake cities / your HQ.
You can also visit the town of *Anglem* in **Diaspola**. There the NPC Borgnine give you a trade offer for a Sentoul Demon statue if you have one (you should have at least one through Posha's quest, I think of Demon for you achievement). If you refuse him you will get a reputation drop and you can repeat the process infinitely.

### Alignment / Charisma
ALI and CHA stats for most characters are used for class change. For your main Lord it impact endings and characters recruitment. In battle, high ALI units fight better during the day and low ALI during the night, but exception made of units like Vampire and Werewolf the difference is minimal.

**ALI is raised by:**

-   Killing a higher level enemy
-   Killing a low ALI enemy
-   Random card draws after liberation

**ALI is lowered by:**

-   Killing a lower level enemy
-   Killing a high ALI enemy (like Priests and Angels)
-   Random card draws after liberation

**CHA is raised by:**

-   Killing a higher level enemy
-   Killing a low CHA enemy
-   Random card draws after liberation

**CHA is lowered by:**

-   Killing a lower level enemy
-   Killing a high CHA enemy
-   Running from battle

How to manipulate it ? For lowering purpose it's quite simple, just park your unit into a liberated town and wait for waves upon waves of enemies to die on your sword. Be careful to not tank your CHA too much for human characters as even evil one needs it to class change. Most monster on the other hand don’t care for it.

Now to reliably augment it outside of regular battle, the trick is to revisit map with Undead neutral units. Undead have 0HP, very low ALI and CHA but can only be killed by White attribute attack. Find a White attribute weapon via treasure manipulation and equip the character you want to boost.

Same trick can be used to raise level characters without changing their ALI/CHA. Because only the character dealing the killing blow get the change but everyone in the unit get the XP, anyone incapable of doing White damage won't change ALI/CHA but gain levels.

Early game Pogrom Forest is a good spot.
At lv15 you have Wraith in the swamps of Balmorian ruins.
Antalia have lv21 undeads.
For endgame endings unlock, Deneb's Garden have lv1 Pumpkins that will make your ALI and CHA plummet.

### Misc Notes

[Battle maps](https://ogrebattlesaga.fandom.com/wiki/Category:The_March_of_the_Black_Queen_-_Locations)

[Unit upgrade chart](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588541-ogre-battle-the-march-of-the-black-queen/map/12980-unit-upgrade-chart)

[Starting lord question guide](https://ogrebattlesaga.fandom.com/wiki/Opinion_Leader)

-   Equipment not only improve the stats of a character but can also change the elemental property of his attacks. This is especially important to be more efficient against some boss or to be able to kill undead with White attacks.

-   You have a max limit to the number of characters you can have in your army (to be tested but seems to be around 95 ?). Make sure you have enough space available to recruit story characters.

-   Hidden treasure drops are random and available if you go back to a map where you didn’t get them. If you want to meta-game you can save before revisiting a map, go through the different spots and reload if you don’t get what you were looking for. This is mainly useful for getting the Fireseal as one of the required item is a random drop weapon (Euros). **This is needed for 1 achievement**

-   The Pause button is really powerful. When you get a fight notification, before clearing the pop-up you can hit pause to look at your stats, the enemies stats, change equipment, your formation or use item for healing.

-   Classes have different movement type but the most powerful one is probably High Sky, which allow you to zoom through the map quickly. For your regular heavy hitters you can settle for Low Sky instead by putting units such as Gryphon or Hawkmen into your setup.

-   Unit available for recruitment in town change based on who is doing the recruiting. Higher tier class can recruit more units, high ALI can recruit other high ALI classes such as Angel, Beastmaster can recruit beasts, Dragonmaster can recruit dragons, etc. Don’t hesitate to check with a couple of different classes !

-   You can absolutely use Evil or low ALI/CHA characters regardless of your reputation. As long as you liberate cities with high ALI units, it won't impact your reputation. That mean that you mainly need to pay attention to your main Lord and that for the rest of your units you can use the most depraved killers and still get good endings.

-   For any achievement requiring special dialogue with the Boss, you don’t need said unit to deal the killing blow, they just need to fight once. If you don’t want to  have to think about it too much, you can create a 2-characters unit with the Char needed and a Gryphon to fly directly to the boss, trigger the dialog and immediately retreat.

-   If you input your starting name as "MUSIC/ON", you will access the soundtest. You need to reset the console after as it seems there is no other way to go back.

-   Fight between two units are automated but there is a couple of things to know. If you are standing still and the enemy attack you the battle will take place on your terrain, and vice-versa. If you both were moving the battle will be on the terrain in-between the two units.
-   Battle end when everyone used their attacks, winner is decided by which side did the more damage. Exception is made for Boss, where you will lose if you don’t kill the leader. Healing is not deduced from the total damage done.
-   You can change targeting priority with the tactics selected. For boss battle, Leader is the most useful as you only need to kill the boss to end the map.
-   While all character in a unit gain XP from a battle, ALI and CHA change only impact the character that deal the killing blow. The only exception to that is for kill made with Tarot cards, the change and XP are applied to the main Lord instead.
-   There is a limited amount of enemy units per map, most of the time around 20 or so. To reduce that number you need to kill ALL of the characters in an unit otherwise it will run back to a town and replenish its rank. The only exception is for the last map of the game that have something like 2200+ units (infinite for all intents and purpose).

*Liberate All Cities and Temples then Complete \*MAP\* and see \*CHARACTER\* special dialog with boss*

Pretty self explanatory. Please note that the "see special dialog with boss" condition doesnt need said character to deal the killing blow to the boss.
