Many members of our community have drawn far art as a celebration of an achievement or a challenge for an event, such as Rack it Up. In this monthly article, we would like to share with you the ones that have been sent in to us via our inbox! Today, we will be focusing on submissions from the Rack it Up and Challenge League Top 100 events.

**If you have made fan art for Bendyhuman's Challenge League Top 100 task and you want us to showcase your art, please send them to our inbox or let any of our members know, thank you! Any other fan art is also welcome!**

Mario has been duking it out with his rival Wario in all kinds of games and parties, but what about... wrestling? Taking bets now, may this actually be where Wario will end up the supreme victor??

What a surprising turn of events: little mac has been taken out! Even Searo Goku is completely shocked. Is he going to defend the title in the ring instead?

The charging chucks are out to stop Mario in his tracks again... but wait. One of them does not look like the others... Ah well, I'm sure the fellow will do a good job out there!
