# Episode 19 - Pinball Wizard

For many users here, the promise of a good time and an enjoyable revisit down memory lane is enough to keep them going. For others perhaps they will lean into creation that can take several forms, from development, to webcoding, community organization, and many more - For a select few though, they see opportunity, a stage, and a springboard from which to catapult themselves into new heights. 

With so many varied approaches, tactics, and opinions factoring into what it means to be an RA community member, I wanted to seek out somebody who recently took home the prize of Twitch Partner; a huge accomplishment of merit and dedication - Combined with having years of longevity within the community, allowing them to show us how things used to be, and where they could possibly go.
