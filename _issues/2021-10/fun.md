## Spot the Difference

It was always somewhat chaotic in Zeke's and Julie's neighborhood but this time it's even worst. Everyone is getting attacked by monsters like Zombies, Werewolfs, Vampires and Horror-Dolls. And what is even worse, there are 10 things different in the current scene. Can you find all 10 differences in the lower image?
