## Introduction
![Image](https://retroachievements.org/Images/045872.png)
 
Welcome to the achievement guide for [-Prototype- Biohazard 2 \| Resident Evil 1.5]( https://retroachievements.org/game/17454)! This guide was made on the fact that the game is highly undocumented and would prove difficult to get all the achievements only by trial and error, let alone progress the story normally. This guide will cover all the achievements currently on the set and if the set gets updated to include more achievements this guide will also be updated.

## Achievement Summary
 
There are currently **84 achievements** worth a total of **1015 points**.

## Debug Protection

Due to this game being a Prototype it has easily accessed debug features that the original developers used to easily test their code ingame, due to the nature of these features the achievement set has protection against all of them, If you noticed an achievement didn't trigger when it was supposed to it most likely was this protection kicking in and pausing it. The easiest way to not trigger them when you don't want to by mistake is disabling the input for the **Select** button in your emulator of choice, Don't worry you don't actually need them to finish the game with either character. If you did use the debug functions however you can unpause the achievements by starting a new game with either character normally.

## Save Support

The game currently lacks any sort of save support so if you die in the game you need to start from the beginning all over again, making these challenges more hard to get than in any other Resident Evil game, this is reflected in their values being double what they would normally be plus the game difficulty is increased due to the amount of hits it takes to kill any enemy so beware.

<details><summary>Spoilers</summary>To get this achievement you must clear the game with either character without healing at any point in the game, which gives you a limited health bar to work with, I recommend learning a fast route and enemy patterns before trying this achievement. Only doing what's necessary to progess the story as to not expose yourself to more danger.</details>
