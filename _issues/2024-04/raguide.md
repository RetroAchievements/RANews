## Preface

Zupapa! is an arcade game (for Neo Geo MVS) with cute and colorful pixel art. I remember playing it as a kid, so here I revisited the game and made a set of achievements for it. The basic part of the set (progression) doesn't have restrictions on the way of playing. Though, there are also challenge achievements, which requires a specific settings – the defaults will be good enough. I also intended to make the set multiplayer friendly, so you can invite another person to play the game with you (unfortunately, there is one achievement which had to be done in 1-player mode, as that's the requirement from the game developers). It is possible to get all achievements in one playthrough.

## How to play

### Basics
Game uses only directional movement controls and two keys: one (B) for jumping/stepping down, other one (A) for punching/throwing.

Your goal is to clear the stage by defetaing your enemies by touching them when they are stunned. There are 9 worlds in the game, which every (except the last one) has 5 stages. The last stage of the world always have a boss.

You can stun the enemy by punching them or by throwing a Zook at them. When you touch stunned enemy, they will vanish – and when zooks were stunning them, will leave an expanding circle of stars, which touching enemies will do the same to them. The more Zooks will be stunning the same enemy, the bigger radius that circle will have, which rise chances to make a solid combo.
To have a Zook with you, you need just to touch one and then it will start following you, until you throw them.

## Achievements guide
### Clear World (1-6)

| {% raachpic 384984, 435882, Clear Japanese World (10) %}       | Clear all stages of Japanese World and beat the boss [Difficulty 4 or higher]       |
| {% raachpic 384985, 435883, Clear Jungle World (10) %}         | Clear all stages of Jungle World and beat the boss [Difficulty 4 or higher]         |
| {% raachpic 384986, 435884, Clear Nightmare World (10) %}      | Clear all stages of Nightmare World and beat the boss [Difficulty 4 or higher]      |
| {% raachpic 384987, 435885, Clear Toy Factory World (10) %}    | Clear all stages of Toy Factory World and beat the boss [Difficulty 4 or higher]    |
| {% raachpic 384988, 435886, Clear Prehistoric World (10) %}    | Clear all stages of Prehistoric World and beat the boss [Difficulty 4 or higher]    |
| {% raachpic 384989, 435887, Clear Amusement Park World (10) %} | Clear all stages of Amusement Park World and beat the boss [Difficulty 4 or higher] |

When you start the game, you can choose the starting world from the six available – then you play each world in clockwise order. An interesting fact is, that the first World is always easier, which is, that enemies are less agressive, and boss has less health. The difficulty rises with each next world. These achievements doesn't have restriction on credits/lives, so you can try clear the stages as much as you want.

### Clear World (7-8)

| {% raachpic 384990, 435888, Clear Electronic World (25) %} | Clear all stages of Electronic World and beat the boss [Difficulty 4 or higher] |
| {% raachpic 384991, 435889, Clear Medieval World (25) %}   | Clear all stages of Medieval World and beat the boss [Difficulty 4 or higher]   |

These worlds are having higher difficulty and bosses are more complex. Though, you still can try clear these in how many tries you want.
    
### Clear World (9)

| {% raachpic 384992, 435890, Clear Last World (50) %} | Clear all stages of Last World and beat the boss [Difficulty 4 or higher] |

The last world consists of only two stages. In the first one, you have to deal with all types of enemies from previous worlds, which are spawning from the gates on both sides of multiple floors. You have also a bat at top center, which from time to time, attacks you with an electric bolt, so beware on that. Because there is a lot of different types of enemies, it is good to throw all Zooks on one of them and try to circle-combo the rest on other floors.
On the second stage, you have last boss fight. You need to throw all the Zooks at him, so he will transform into a big Zook. He has a handful choice of attacks:
* Between main attacks, he flies from one side of screen to the other (left and right). Make sure you step on the first platform, to make a jump on next one when he goes closer (don't make it too early, because then he will start flying up to get you). Before he gets closer, you can throw some Zooks at him.
* When he stops flying on the center bottom, he can start one of the attacks without much of notice, so you need to be prepared. He can start a horizontal laser beam, so you should be higher, on second platform. He can shoot fireballs, the same like the dragon boss from Medieval world. He can start teleporting, making weird faces, then you should keep away from corners, where he can appear. He can also use his long hand to wave it a bit in your direction, so you need keep away from him. After the attack, he starts to fly again.
* When he stops at the very center of the screen, he will move away to cast some electric balls around the screen. Attack will start from top left, right, or center. Look where the attack starts and move to the other side at the bottom, so you will be safe there. Where to run when attack starts from the center? Probably left bottom corner will be a good place to stay.

### Score Achievements

| {% raachpic 384996, 433877, Fruit Lover (5) %}              | Get a score of 500k [Difficulty 4 or higher, Lives 3 or less]      |
| {% raachpic 384997, 433878, Hit the Jackpot (10) %}         | Get a score of 1 million [Difficulty 4 or higher, Lives 3 or less] |
| {% raachpic 384993, 433869, Everything Made of Gold (25) %} | Get a score of 3 million [Difficulty 4 or higher, Lives 3 or less] |

First score achievement is pretty easy to get, as on some later stages, you are getting that much after one-two stages. There are powerups, which gives additional points for doing jumps and punches, and the most important one there: for doubling points from all items. Power ups holds as long, as you don't lose a life, so it's important to gather points without getting hit. After a boss fight, you get a lot of items to collect, with each next world having items more and more valued (so having a 2x power up is giving a lot of points there). Also, by making big circle-combos you are getting more valued items with every enemy getting into the radius – worth mentioning again Golden Zupapa, which gives 10000, so it's good to make good combos on whole stage. If you keep these bonuses without dying, you will be able to get 3 mln points without a problem.

### The Most Powerful Zupapa

| {% raachpic 384994, 433872, The Most Powerful Zupapa (5) %} | Have all possible power ups active at once [Difficulty 4 or higher, Lives 3 or less] |

This achievement just requires getting every available power up, so you just need to try getting them without losing a live (because then you lost all activated power ups). Some nice point power ups are falling from the sky after beating a boss, so it's a good chance to collect some of them.

### Today Zooks Stay in Kindergarten

| {% raachpic 384995, 433876, Today Zooks Stay in Kindergarten (5) %} | Clear a stage without getting any Zooks with you [Difficulty 4 or higher] |

In many stages Zooks, as the little rascals they are, will run and jump over platforms, and when they touch you, they get attached and be ready to be thrown. However, there are a few stages, where Zooks are closed between crystal blockades, which gives you the chance to clear the stage using only your punches, without Zooks getting in a way.
The best stages to get this achievement:
* Amusement Park World, Stage 2
* Japanese World, Stage 2
* Prehistoric World, Stage 3

### Golden Zupapa

| {% raachpic 385001,433882, Golden Zupapa (5) %} | Get Golden Zupapa on any stage [Difficulty 4 or higher] |

To get the Golden Zupapa (which is worth 10000 points) you need to clear the stage by beating only one enemy (and clearing the rest with its circle-combo). In fact, the game gives a guide on how to do that in one of its demo fragments (and showing it on Japanese World, Stage 1, which is probably the easiest stage to try this challenge).

### The Great Zupapa Will Not Be Defeated

| {% raachpic 385002,433883, The Great Zupapa Will Not Be Defeated (10) %} | Clear any world before the last one without losing a life [Difficulty 4 or higher, Lives 3 or less] |

This achievement should be kind of easy to do on the very first world chosen (as you know, this will have low difficulty).

### Bonus stage achievements  

| {% raachpic 384998,433879, Ring the Bell For Me (5) %} | Get a perfect on bonus stage and obtain a life [Difficulty 4 or higher, Lives 3 or less] |
| {% raachpic 384999,433880, Sweet Tooth (5) %}          | Get at least 50k of points on a bonus stage [Difficulty 4 or higher, Lives 3 or less]    |

Bonus stage appears after boss fight on 3rd and 6th world.
Both achievements require hitting the bell: one as fast as possible to get it to the end in time (and getting 1-up), and the other one with breaks to collect as much desserts as you can. Take a note, that desserts on higher platforms are more valuable, so try to get them from both sides of the stage. You rather don't want to do both achievements at one bonus stage, so it's better to focus on one of these goals (you still can do both on one playthrough, as you have two Bonus Stages). Also, bonus stages on 3rd and 6th world have a small difference in their layout. I think that on the first one it's easier to get perfect, while on the other one points.

### A Small Adventure for One Credit

| {% raachpic 385000,433881, A Small Adventure for One Credit (25) %} | Clear first 6 worlds on one credit [Difficulty 4 or higher, Lives 3 or less] |

Okay, here is the moment where real challenges starts. You already know, that world selected at the beginning will be easiest. This is good opportunity to choose the world you have the biggest problem with. Though, its up to a specific person, which one would be the most problematic. Remember, that every next will be more difficult.

### A Great Adventure for One Credit

| {% raachpic 385885,435891, A Great Adventure for One Credit (100) %} | Clear all worlds on one credit in 1-player mode [Difficulty 4 or higher, Lives 3 or less] |

This achievement requires doing a bit more than "A Small Adventure for One Credit". Furthermore, you can notice that this one particularly requires a 1-player mode to get it. It is caused by the game, which displays a special scene at the end only on these conditions.

You probably won't get this on your first playthrough, but if you know the worlds and how to obtain lives (points + bonus stage), then it could be easier to make it on standard settings.
