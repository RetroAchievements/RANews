## \~Homebrew~ \~Demo~ Glory Hunters: Chapter 1 (Game Boy)

So, I heard you like achievements, so I decided to put achievements in your achievements so you can achievement while you achievement. Playing Glory Hunters Ch. 1 on RA is basically that meme, except as an actual fun game experience, and a promising prototype for a full game that according to the creator's still-active social media, one that might even be available soon!

You play in a world that is vaguely Zelda-like, using a chopping sword with the ability to upgrade it, and fighting some relatively normal (but interestingly designed) enemies. What makes this game so interesting is the currency system, which uses "glory points" earned by achievements to do ... everything. From paying guards to open paths, buying items, and even the incredibly long grind for the 100 point skull, which at the time of writing has taken me literal days, this game lets you go for any achievement you want, and put the points to use.

Most categories in this game come in tiers, with achievements for getting 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000 - yes, you read that right - of each action type. Some of the longer actions cut off after 100, removing incentive to grind them an excessively large number of times, even for the most dedicated glory hunter.

The game includes several future paths into an open world, a dungeon with a very basic boss battle, interesting NPCs, and a museum showing future enemies and quest logs - along with a quest board for the first town, the chance to increase your HP, and even a few Easter eggs. It's a great teaser, and worth playing in its own right, and one that has me eager to see the final product!

## Mickey's Ultimate Challenge (Game Gear)

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a light puzzle game starring the iconic cartoon mouse. In the 90s, Mickey was a tour de force in the 2D platforming world, headlining classics such as [The Great Circus Mystery](https://retroachievements.org/game/573) and the [Magical Quest](https://retroachievements.org/game/2262) series. Ultimate Challenge takes a different approach, opting for slower-paced puzzle challenges instead of adrenaline-pumping action.

The game sends your chosen mouse (Mickey or Minnie) to a storybook fantasy dreamworld plagued by constant, mysterious earthquakes. You must complete several different challenges to earn items and discover the cause of the quakes. Challenges differ in both cleverness and fun - you'll play a fairly standard "Simon Says" style game, push potions in a box pushing game, and even engage in a Wordle-esque symbol game with Goofy. None of the puzzles are terribly challenging, but they also won't frustrate you for too long and don't overstay their welcome.

An interesting bit of trivia with this game is the amount of ports it received. To my knowledge, it is the only Mickey game that appeared not only on both major consoles at the time (Nintendo's SNES and Sega's Genesis), but each company's respective handheld device and even being one of the final two officially released games for Sega's previous console, the Master System, in 1998!

The Game Gear version (the one we're focusing on) is probably around the middle in terms of port quality. The graphics and sound are solid enough for the device, being very close to the Master System and solidly above the Game Boy and its lack of color, but understandably faltering compared to the SNES and Genesis. The gameplay remains virtually unchanged between all ports, with even the handheld versions not requiring any cut games or significant compromises to any of the puzzles.

If you're looking for a light, refreshing bout of puzzles with a touch of Disney charm, you'll be perfectly content with Ultimate Challenge. For some added fun, go for mastery on all four versions with sets currently. Or develop a set for the Genesis and complete the full port family!

If someone played the [GBA](https://retroachievements.org/game/6141) version and then saw this one they would probably think its another garbage version, but its not. It should not even be called "version" since it's an entirely different game than on [PS2](https://retroachievements.org/game/20635). It features original titans only seen in this version and also brand new levels, pretty comfy physics, and I dare say is as good as the PS2 version or even better. It features better collectibles on the levels, and unlike the PS2 version, it also features crates, gems, and the [iconic dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG5Bf1dvPiM) after beating the levels. I was surprised there was even voice acting on it. This version was no doubt made with love and everyone should give it a try!

As for the set, it covers everything the game has to offer and has a couple of challenges, the hardest with no doubt being [this one](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/373617). Doing this on PC would be a pain so I decided to switch back to phone (thanks Nintendo for the touchscreen). The deathless all crates were also challenging but nothing crazy. I had a blast playing this set.

## \~Hack~ SMW For Your Kids Only (SNES/Super Famicom)

Have you ever wanted to delve into the madness that are Mario Kaizo hacks? To learn how to skillfully and effortlessly glide through levels? Unfortunately, this game won't teach you those specific skills. But don't despair! Because what this game does do is provide you with a first stepping stone towards that challenge. And as the common saying goes, "a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."

SMW For Your Kids Only is a hack of the ever famous [Super Mario World](https://retroachievements.org/game/228) that, instead of increasing the difficulty, gives you a short and sweet adventure designed to be a first introduction to the game's mechanics. While it is advertised as being a version for kids, it is a hack that everyone can enjoy. It will teach you movement mechanics like running, jumping, swimming, and holding objects. It will also teach you how levels can be revisited after certain points in the game to find extra exits, thus encouraging exploration. And you won't ever have to worry about running out of lives, since the game just showers you with green mushrooms. The "earn 99 lives" achievement won't be a grind, I promise!

The set itself is a great complement to the experience. It has your usual progression and collection achievements and it adds some really fun and manageable challenges that show you the game's potential.
Each level has a (hidden) 3-Up Moon that will each reward you with an achievement when you find it. The first few levels also have a challenge run achievement, tailored to the level's mechanics. To name a few, one will limit the amount of times you're allowed to jump while another will ask you to avoid certain blocks. And, my personal favorite [Walking On Sunshine, Not Running On Sunshine](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/397317), due to the clever naming and proposed challenge.

All in all, this hack can be a wonderful experience if you've never played any SMW game and are looking for a place to start or if you just want an easy game to relax with. However, if you're looking for a bigger challenge, this is probably not the game you want. But lastly, if you have kids and want to introduce them to the wonders of SMW, then this is definitely the game for all of you!

## \~Homebrew~ Gunman Clive (Game Boy)

Whether you're looking for a quick "Beat" or a pretty easy Mastery, Gunman Clive has got you covered. The game is a demo and really quite short (there's an achievement for beating it in under 50 seconds), but I found myself impressed with the smooth animations and enjoyable gameplay. I came away from the game with a mastery which took a few attempts to get it done without taking any damage, and wishing there was more - it was quite enjoyable despite the very short time I had with it. Give it a go - play this set!

## Sonic the Hedgehog (Genesis/Mega Drive)

Sonic 1 is a good game and you should play it.

Okay, I know I have to say more, but as Game Numero Uno on the site I have to give it its fair dues. The way to victory is not through reckless abandon but through careful platforming, which is against the spirit of Sonic but undeniably the way to go. Otherwise you'll ram into enemies, trip into bottomless pits, and drown in a labyrinth.

As the game that's front and center in the ID list, it'd be understandable if someone were to see the set as a bit basic compared to what we have on offer now. But I believe this simplicity is what allows it to be so enjoyable and accessible. There are some achievements for beating each stage - easy - and then a handful of miscellaneous challenge achievements, which is where the meat of your time will probably be spent.

These challenge achievements are mostly good. Some are free and a little pointless (wait until 9:55 to finish a level, wait until you're about to drown to grab air) but the others help you reach a better understanding of the game's mechanics. [Under-achiever](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/38) forces you to learn the layout of the iconic Green Hill Zone on a much more intimate level than just speeding through it. [Zee Almighty Box Smasher](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/32) requires good knowledge, routing, and going fast enough to achieve it.

What this set offers is a nice way to learn a classic game without busting your balls too hard. 100% the game, learn a few tricks, challenge your ability to traverse a couple stages, and leave with a nice feeling of satisfaction. It's not too simple as to feel empty, but not too complex as to feel overwhelming. It's a great gateway into RetroAchievements... if you like Sonic.

## Arcade Gears Vol. 1: Pu-Li-Ru-La (Saturn)

| Game                                                            | Console | Genre                                                  |

* Set by: {% rauserpic tomojin %}
* Write-up by: {% rauserpic orchidcnr %}

I knew something was special about Pu-Li-Ru-La the moment I took a peek at a longplay after its debut for the Saturn DevJam. The thing that immediately caught my eye was its art style. Everything looks almost like a play, with all the entity sprites looking like flat cardboard cutouts. It fits Pu-Li-Ru-La's theming wonderfully: bizarre, unpredictable nonsense. One level you could be escaping a frozen tundra filled with flying octopuses and the next you could be fighting walking cacti in the middle of the barren desert. Despite this, everything still manages to fit together well, and nothing feels out of place. Oddly enough, the lack of one, central theme really grounds the whole game, and makes Pu-Li-Ru-La especially unique compared to other beat 'em ups.

You play as Zac (or his sister, Mel) attempting to save Radishland from some "bad man" who stole a key that kept time flowing correctly. Pu-Li-Ru-La actually released sometime in 1991 in the arcades, but got a PlayStation and Sega Saturn port in 1997 in Japan. Arcade Gears Vol. 1: Pu-Li-Ru-La, the specific version this write-up is detailing, actually has some interesting changes compared to the original arcade release. For instance, enemy AI and hitboxes are quite different for some reason. {% rauserpic LordBBH %} detailed a lot of the changes in the game's comment wall if you're curious. There was also a PS2 port via Taito Legends, but once again, only in Japan.

The set itself is by {% rauserpic tomojin %}, who you can tell put a lot of effort into making this the best set it can be. Plus, if the core set isn't enough Pu-Li-Ru-La for you, they also released [multi](https://retroachievements.org/game/28322) and [bonus](https://retroachievements.org/game/28437) sets as well! Of course, the set has your standard progression, as well as beating the game on hard difficulty. There's also damageless/limited damage and deathless no-magic achievements for each stage. Essentially, magic is an extremely useful mechanic that allows you to call in magical help to deal some extra damage. The most useful part about this, however, is the invincibility frames they give you. Your magic bar has three uses and refills whenever you lose a life. There's also little pumpkins you can occasionally find, that either give you an extra life or an extra magic use. Usually, the best strat for damageless is to use as little magic as possible throughout the level so you have plenty left for the boss fight. Even then, you're bound to run out of magic, so learning the boss' attack patterns is lucrative. The hardest stage for both is definitely the real final boss, as he spams fireball attacks that can be quite annoying to dodge. There's also achievements for various types of magic usage, a neat little bonus scene, and a few utilizing some of the special cheat codes. Notably, beating the game with both the smallest and largest character size, and beating the game in "ura" mode as both Zac and Mel.

Even though this version is arguably inferior to its original arcade release, {% rauserpic tomojin %}'s amazing set makes up for it and adds a truly unique beat 'em up to RA's repertoire.

## LocoRoco (PlayStation Portable)

| Game                                    | Console              | Genre                                                                                                                |

* Set by: {% rauserpic TheJediSonic %}

LocoRoco is a game very unlike any other that I've played. This charming little physics platformer developed by [Japan Studio](https://retroachievements.org/game/20186) and published by [Sony](https://retroachievements.org/game/8248) in 2006 follows an interesting premise – your goal is to move the LocoRoco from the beginning of the stage to the end, having them eat fruit to grow and multiply along the way. However, you have very little direct control over your globby friends. Rather, you must guide them to the goal by tilting and shaking the world around them, as well as commanding them to split apart and merge together when necessary. Simply reaching the goal on any given stage is an incredibly easy task, but the real meat and bones of the game lie in collecting all of the berries, MuiMui, and Pickories along the way.

Certainly the defining traits of this game are its art style and sound design, which both are designed to create the fun, bouncy atmosphere of the game. The game makes heavy use of bright color and round, bouncy shapes to keep the levels interesting to run through, and the music is complemented by the LocoRoco singing along (with each of the six different types of LocoRoco having a unique voice). The end result is a bright, fun-feeling game that quickly stands out from the pack of games released on the PSP.

{% rauserpic TheJediSonic %}'s achievement set for LocoRoco primarily covers 100% completion of the game, including beating the target times for every stage unlocked after reaching the end with all 20 LocoRoco and collecting all of the parts for the Loco House. While beating the game may be incredibly simple, many of the collectables are carefully hidden or difficult to reach, and some of the target times can be surprisingly tight. You also need to take care not to lose your LocoRoco to obstacles or enemies along the way, which can often be easier said than done.

I initially played this game simply to get a free reroll in [RA Roulette](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=25399), but I can confidently say that I am glad that I did, and I fully intend on mastering this in the future, and I would absolutely recommend this set to anyone who is remotely interested.

## \~Homebrew~ Days Without (Game Boy Color)

"Cozy" is seldom a word used to describe horror games, but that's exactly the first adjective that came to mind while exploring the bleak but (possible) hopeful world of Days Without. A tale of depression, grief, resilience, and partnership told in the fashion of GB Studio that you can master in 30 minutes or less that also emanates passion of small game developers, specially since it was made for a jam, which explains how short and simple the entire run is. It is experimental and almost feels like a demo to what could be a bigger storyline with deeper mechanics, but I felt like it was enough for me when the mastery pop-up appeared during the cockcrow hour while I was facing my own demons during an insomniac dawn. The way you meet the dog and pet it for no practical reason while he is also the save point – not that you will need to load it anyway – exudes that sense of companionship amidst horror and chaos, which is the warmth you get from a neighbour-acquaintance through letters and telephone calls during the apocalypse, which feels like a superlative analogy to one's state of mind while still maintaining that survival horror dread while finding your way through corridors infested of disgusting creatures. I know I didn't say much about the game mechanics or the story and only spoke in vague metaphors instead of going into deep analysis of its themes, but it's a short enough game for me to spoil for you. I hope all these words tucked in a single disorganized paragraph may incite someone to also play this little barely-noticeable gem and get lost in emotions for half an hour in what isn't necessarily quite an exquisite game, but is still a little fun time that you can share with yourself while giving it some thoughts.

## Little Magic (SNES/Super Famicom)

The mage apprentice May is about to graduate in the Mage Academy, the final exam is her last challenge. The only problem is: May was never that good with magic and will definitely need to rely on her wits to compensate... and her experience with puzzle games.

Little Magic is a pretty simple game with simple mechanics. Each stage has one and the same objective: take the Magic Stone to its pedestal and descend to another floor. That, however, doesn't mean there's no complexity behind it, quite the opposite, the simplicity only makes it well structured. The more you progress, the more the game will demand your expertise with every move and combination possible, but Little Magic makes sure that you don't need to worry with anything else besides git gud, sustaining it with effective and simple controls, infinite continues (that almost makes the life system trivial), and passwords for each and every objective, eliminating any concern with losing progress and making trial and error almost free of cost. It's also very charming; the soundtrack and different scenarios function well changing the atmosphere from time to time without breaking the players concentration, maintaining a dynamic experience.

{% rauserpic Jamiras %} did a great job bringing this hidden gem to RA, a simple and effective set for an equally simple and effective game, with the bonus of having some challenges to take the life system with a bit more care. It’s always interesting getting to know good games that were not released here in the West, and Little Magic is certainly one of those positive experiences.
