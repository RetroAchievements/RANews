# Episode 20 - Grand Tour Adventure In Achievement

Within Retroachievements there are lots of ways to figuratively 'play' - you can choose to tackle masteries, chase down leaderboards, challenge yourself amongst the hardcore ranks; or even throw yourself into the achievement development scene to create experiences for others and in turn gain even more metrics - but the creativity for self challenge and exploration doesn't have to end there. Creativity is an utmost paramount to most everything we do here at RA, from playing the games to making the achievements, the lot of us are simply trying to experience a greater way to play - for some though, a unique and interesting path can choose to be forged

For exactly that reason I have my guest here today, {% rauser CobaltZeroni %}, to talk to us about their very own Grand Tour through RA - and what it means to be such a legacy member with such a personal goal.
