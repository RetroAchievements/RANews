Before getting into this list, I want to preface this with a clarification. I do like a lot of different styles of games! From Action to Stealth, Racing to Puzzle, I have fun with most of them. However, when it comes to my favorites, I tend to have a trend, and I think you will pick up on it fairly quickly. The name Roadkill stuck with me for a reason! That all being said…

_"You better get them before they get you!"_

Ape Escape is one of the games that I have recently discovered, but I could see my younger self falling in love with it. The game sees the primary ape-antagonist, Specter, stealing a helmet that increases his mental capacity while also twisting his mind to evil. He gives other apes copies of these helmets as well, and it is up to you to catch all of these apes before they destroy history! I love the collectathon genre, and this game takes it to another level.

_"Can you believe what Tomba has to go through to conquer the menacing swine?!"_

Do you remember demo discs? I had one with a bunch of games on it, but Tomba! was the one I played the most. I never got the full game growing up, but eventually I found a copy, and I am glad I did! This game is a delight, having colorful scenery, goofy enemies, and an emotive protagonist. My first foray into the Metroidvania genre, it isn’t my favorite one anymore, but is still one of my favorite games.

_"Pac-Man is back!"_

I was never a huge fan of the original Pac-Man series of games. The maze chase genre never really stuck with me outside of Devil World, and even that one was a short lived enjoyment. But something about Pac-Man World struck a chord in me that I couldn’t ignore. Less like a maze chase and more of a 3D Platformer, you must save your family and relatives from the evil ghosts by collecting enough pellets to open up the next world, and sometimes you can find classic style stages to break up the 3D Platforming gameplay.

_"Radio control racing done right!"_

If you asked for my favorite game of all time, it would be the PC fan project of this game, RVGL. However, the PlayStation port of this game is… less than spectacular. My bias is absolutely playing a part here, but even still this version of the game is a blast. This physics based racer has you controlling RC cars in everyday environments like neighborhoods, supermarkets, museums, and cruise ships. When you get hit by a Rocket or Shockwave, instead of your car going through a generic animation, it causes you to go flying off in some direction, flipping over and spinning out. Even the best versions of this game are not the most polished, but are still great fun! If you want to try a set of this game, check out the N64 set created by the legendary Bl4h8L4hBl4h!

| 6 | {% ragamepic 11260, 089303, Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! \| Spyro 2: Gateway to Glimmer %} |

_"Mess with this dragon and feel the burn!"_

When you think of iconic PSX mascots, Spyro is one of the first to come to mind, at least for me! Once again my love for the collectathon genre shows, with another of the greatest showing up. This was my first game I ever played that went into the 3D environment, and as such left a strong impact on me. I played this game to 100% multiple times growing up, and never got tired of it. Controlling Spyro feels so fluid for the time, the levels are all so vibrant, and the minigame challenges break up the core gameplay in fun ways. If you play PlayStation games, this one is a must.

| 5 | {% ragamepic 17161, 069078, Star Wars: Demolition %} |

_"The mighty Jabba asks that you die honorably"_

If I ever wrote a "request this set", it would be for this game. Even the Dreamcast version doesn’t have one! Star Wars used to be one of my favorite IPs ever, and that was mostly thanks to the games. This game takes on the Twisted Metal style of demolition derby, where you pilot your vehicle around the map, pick up weapons, and destroy the opponents. What puts this above Twisted Metal for me is the Star Wars IP. You pilot ATT tanks, Landspeeders, Skiffs, you can even just be Boba Fett with his jetpack! The environments are all very fun too, with the wastelands of Tatooine and Hoth, or the cluttered cities on Naboo or around Bespin. I spent days playing multiplayer with my brother and friends, and loved every second.

| 4 | {% ragamepic 11387, 029698, Bushido Blade 2 %} |

_"No life bars, no time limits, no mercy"_

This is one of the only fighting games I will ever put on a Top X list. The concept of it stuck with me, and I have not found another that does it quite as well. This game is a touch of death fighting game, where one right move decides victory or defeat. Choose your warrior, choose your weapon, and strike when the moment is right to claim your victory. Another game that I played hours upon hours of multiplayer, and every round was just as tense as the last.

| 3 | {% ragamepic 10438, 081550, Crash Team Racing %} |

_"It’s a full blown battle on wheels. Buckle up."_

Crash Team Racing is the best kart racing game out there. Better than any Mario Kart. Even better than Diddy Kong Racing. Yes, even better than Garfield Kart Racing! No other kart racer has given me such a feeling of control over my vehicle, made me feel like skill was the greater contributor to my victory over luck. The game feels nicer than any kart racer, with a unique drift boost mechanic. The tracks are mostly all unique, with a few standard ones like Crash Cove and Coco Park. Another game that I played to 100% completion over and over again growing up, this is a top game for any racing fan.

| 2 | {% ragamepic 10433, 081159, Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped %} |

_"Oh yeah… he’s back… AND he’s ready!"_

Now, when you think of PSX mascots, Crash Bandicoot IS the first to come to mind! Out of all three of his mainline games on the PSX, Warped is the best. I love nearly every level, the puzzles and obstacles included are all very fun, and the music is great! The Crash Bandicoot series is one of my favorites, and another must play for any PSX enthusiast.

| 1 | {% ragamepic 14451, 089653, Hot Wheels: Turbo Racing %} |

_"High speed racing action"_

Well, this is "Roadkill’s top 10 PlayStation games", not top 10 PlayStation games! This was my favorite game growing up, and continues to be one of my favorites to this day. My favorite style of racing game is easily the “physics” racer, as I don’t know what else to call it. Racing games where your car can flip, tumble, spin out, and bounce around. In this game, you are rewarded for taking the risk of doing a flip or spin after a big jump by getting turbo. Also, it scratches my collectathon itch by hiding cars in all of the tracks for you to unlock if you find them! The soundtrack has an allstar guest list with acts like Primus, The Reverend Horton Heat, and even using Fuel by Metallica as the title track! If you want to play a set for this game, check out the one developed for the N64 port by MaddieKittyTV!
