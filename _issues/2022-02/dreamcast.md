# Intro

You asked, we delivered - the sixth generation of home consoles is finally coming to RetroAchievements with the debut of the Sega Dreamcast! Achievement sets will be released to the public very, very soon; it may even be out already by the time you read this!

We at the RANews team would like to extend our deepest appreciation to the many developers who have contributed to one of the most anticipated new console releases in RetroAchievements history. We also owe a great debt of gratitude to everyone hard at work on the [Libretro Project](https://www.libretro.com/), without whom none of this would be possible.

Although the Dreamcast could not compete with the sales juggernaut that was the PlayStation 2 and ultimately ended up being Sega’s final console, it certainly went out with a bang. As you read through this article, you may notice repetition of words and phrases such as “unique”, “one of a kind”, and “unlike anything else”. This is not hyperbole, but rather speaks to the true nature of the Dreamcast’s library. A staggering number of these games initially sold poorly as a result of their experimental design, before going on to become cult classics years later. If this is your first exposure to the Dreamcast, we encourage you to delve into these games with a sense of curiosity and open-mindedness.

Without further ado, now presenting the RetroAchievements Dreamcast launch window lineup! Some of these sets are still in development, but many have already been completed; keep your eyes peeled for the “Available At Dreamcast Launch” tag. Enjoy!

> It’s impossible to concisely convey what makes Shenmue so special, but you’ve no doubt heard of it from its dedicated fanbase. It’s part murder mystery, part fighting game, part minigame compilation, part job simulator, and that’s only scratching the surface. It’s a slow-paced game with an intricately constructed world, thanks largely to how so much revolves around the in-game clock. Shenmue is a truly ambitious title, a one-of-a-kind experience that you have to play to truly understand the hype.

> The last Dreamcast game released by Sega themselves, Puyo Puyo Fever never made it out of Japan. If you’ve played any Puyo Puyo game in the past, you know what to expect: a tile-matching puzzle game where the tiles are little slime bubbles. Connect four or more of them and all of the connected ones will pop. New to Puyo Puyo Fever however is Fever mode which has filling your fever bar in order to be given a new, temporary board. The new board takes the form of a puzzle wherein creating massive chains will allow even bigger attacks on the opposing player.

- By: {% rauserpic BenGhazi %}

> Ikaruga is a shmup unlike any other, and perhaps one of the greatest in its genre. Enemy bullets come in two distinct colors, and the player can swap between two states whenever they want to become immune to one but susceptible to the other. This mechanic can be used offensively as well, absorbing bullets of the same color to store power and shooting at ships of the opposite color for double damage. Ikaruga is a must-play for anyone looking to take on a notoriously difficult challenge.

> Jet Set Radio is a game that absolutely oozes style. The gameplay is all about rollerblading your way through Tokyo and painting the city with graffiti art. The music is perhaps what the game is best remembered for, with infectiously catchy fully vocalized tunes that you may never get out of your head. The cel-shaded visuals further enhance the game’s unique vibe, and have aged tremendously well. Jet Set Radio is one of those games that encapsulates everything that makes the Dreamcast great.

> The Dreamcast was ahead of its time with its online capabilities, and Sonic Team took full advantage of that technology with Phantasy Star Online, the first online console RPG. Although the achievement set is restricted to offline mode, this is still a massive game with tons to do. The “Ver. 2” in the title refers to a version update over the original that adds even more content. The gameplay loop here is all about fighting monsters and bosses with your customized build, gathering exp and loot, and returning to the hub to prepare for the next adventure.

Code: Veronica X is an improved version of that game, featuring graphical improvements and further story expansion.

> Never one to shy away from bringing esoteric experiences to the arcade, Sega Bass Fishing is the Dreamcast port of Sega’s hit fishing arcade title. The first game to utilize [Sega’s fishing rod controller]( https://segaretro.org/Fishing_Controller) (don’t worry, you can use the standard controller as well) offers several modes: Arcade Mode sees you trying to catch as many fish as possible, in total weight, in a very short time frame. Each fish you catch adds more time to your timer and the bigger the catch, the bigger the time bonus! Original Mode has you competing in fishing tournaments to see who can catch the most fish in total weight. Lastly, there is a Practice Mode you can utilize to help you learn how to get the biggest catches. So, what are you waiting for? Get out on the lake and start casting!

> Skies of Arcadia is an RPG that shows up on pretty much every “Best Dreamcast Games” list, and it’s easy to see why. Between dungeon crawling and exploring the massive world in your airship, there’s a constant sense of discovery, an ongoing fueling of curiosity that makes for an overwhelmingly charming experience. Combined with classic turn-based battles, an engaging story, and impressive graphics for the time, this is pure RPG bliss that embodies all that is great about the genre.

> Space Channel 5: Part 2 doubles down on everything that made the original so great. More levels, tighter controls, better graphics, and even stronger audio design are some of the highlights. The presentation is once again delightfully upbeat and downright weird, somehow to an even greater extent than its predecessor. This is a must play for fans of rhythm games and anyone who can appreciate an offbeat sense of humor.

> Typing of the Dead revisits the plot of The House of the Dead 2 with an unexpected twist. This time around, rather than shooting enemies outright, you damage them by typing the words that appear on your keyboard as quickly as possible. The changes made to the presentation transform what could once be described as horror into more of a comedy. Multiple paths and endings are available once again, adding some variety to subsequent playthroughs. The difficulty is adaptive as well, becoming easier or harder based on the player’s performance. Typing of the Dead is an utterly bizarre game that deserves to be experienced for the novelty factor alone.
