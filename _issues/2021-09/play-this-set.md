Super Smash Bros. 64 was the game to kick off a phenomenal fighting game franchise involving Nintendo's biggest names fighting against each other, and soon after, other companies' big stars as well. But, with how big the Smash Bros series has gotten, the original game feels rather... small in comparison. 12 Fighters, roughly 11 or 12 Stages, and a straight forward Classic Mode. But, what if there was more? This is where this hack in question comes in. Smash Remix rebrands Smash 64 into a brand new experience you can do with friends or by yourself. In addition to the original 12 characters and all the stages, there's much more content with many little details crammed in.
 
Each new character offers a new playstyle that may either originate from a later series installment (ex. Bowser) or even play much differently than ever before (ex. Wario). Additionally, certain characters can be altered and allow for new game styles, including Metal Mario and Giant DK from the mainline 1P Mode. Speaking of, the Single Player Campaign comes with Remix 1P, offering a challenge in the form of new fighters and new stages. However, aside from a couple of challenges such as the Kirby Hat Team, no playthrough is the same. Even if you fight a character you fought before, their stage can also be different as well. But take extra caution: Remix 1P will require only the upmost skill when playing on Very Hard. Take the time to practice characters old and new before diving in. And may you be successful in earning 25 Points per Very Hard Remix 1P. Thank you, SporyTike for making the set. Keep up the great work. And Special Thanks to RustyJimjob45 for originally attempting the set, your efforts shall be remembered.

Quake II, originally released in 1997 for PC by id Software, blew everyone away with a combination of graphics, sound, gameplay and performance. Anyone with only a home console at this time had to sit by the sideline and wait with baited breath; "will we get our own version of this?", all while hoping beyond hope that the latest monster of a PC FPS could be miraculously crammed onto console systems without the game turning into a pile of unplayable crap in the process. Given the usual treatment of previous id Software titles -- Wolfenstein 3D & Doom had both seen some excellent (and admittedly some crap) releases on all sorts of systems over the years, and Quake itself was already being shown off as well-into development for N64 -- a half-decent port of Quake II for consoles did seem apparent.

And then it happened; Quake II found its way onto N64! Was it worth the wait?

Sort of. Quake II on N64 is certainly a mixed bag when it comes to quality, and once you get past the usual jazz of screenshots and into playing the game proper, it really only resembles its namesake on the surface. In short? It's an impressive yet disappointing affair due to a lot of cut content (although it does feature an almost-exclusive map set), and an example of a project just being that bit too ambitious for the targeted hardware. Nonetheless, it remains playable enough to fight through until the end.

Immediately, the general performance of the game becomes the first victim. Things will hover around 30fps provided that nothing is going on and you're looking at little more than a nearby wall, but happily sink like a brick into the low 20's the moment the action starts, even dipping alarmingly close to single-digit performance during some of the more intense firefights. While said firefights involve about five enemies at most, this can still be a real dog to tolerate at the best of times, and the constantly sluggish performance when trying to shoot a few monsters soon becomes an issue during those moments which combine platform-jumping with combat; all too easily it can result in restarting the entire level through no real fault of your own. Keeping in mind that this is with all the benefits of the Expansion Pak! I dread to think how the game performs in those situations without the extra power this small addition provides.

The visual quality itself isn't exactly great either. The HUD weapons are sprite-based, which would be fine if not for the incredibly jerky and often-distracting animations they involve, and the general texture quality on level geometry is compressed beyond recognition in some cases, though the moody coloured lighting goes some way in keeping the world somewhat interesting. Enemy models retain most of their visual clarity, so you can thankfully recognize the various horrors of Stroggos by more than just their sound cues. Speaking of which, the sound here is possibly the game's strongest point, with most of the sounds for weapons, enemies and environment being carried over intact. While the new OST is lacking the raw fast-paced guitar-driven energy of Sonic Mayhem's original offering, Aubrey Hodges goes ahead and does a more than adequate job with his trademark ambient approach, along the lines of his own prior work on the system with Doom 64 and Quake.

So is it worth playing? I'd say so, even if just to experience the exclusive map set. Sure, it's not the greatest example of how to make a PC FPS work on a console, but it's far from insufferable. The achievement set itself for Quake II on N64 is absolutely fine too; there's nothing within that demands you learn any ridiculous speedrunning strategies or engine exploits to succeed. Sure it's a frustrating game at times just to get one or two enemy encounters to play out as you need them to (the Gladiator in particular is a real POS because of this), but it can be cleared with a bit of patience and determination (with some of trial-and-error). You don't need to be a master of the N64 to achieve 200% here -- I'd never even *played* this port until the set was published and blazed through it within two days. Just for the love of god, use/enable the Expansion Pak!

## Legend of Mana (PlayStation)

- Set by: {% rauserpic Alena %}
- Writeup by: {% rauserpic Shianderu %}

Legend of Mana (Seiken Densetsu in Japan) is an Action-RPG (meaning the fights are not turn-based) released by Square Soft (now called Square Enix) for the late PlayStation 1 in 99 in the Orient and in 2000 in West and was a milestone for both the console and the Mana franchise (the last game, Trials of Mana, had been released for the Super Nintendo). If you like role-playing games, with countless possibilities of weapons, armor and other things with a touch of action to shake things up, you should Play This Set!

The story takes place in the fantasy world of Fa'Diel, centuries after a war that involved different races from that world (humans, fairies, demons, etc.) in search of what little was left of the Tree of Mana's power. After the war ended, the tree went into a kind of hibernation to regain its powers and all the lands in the world were stored in artifacts. One day, the protagonist wakes up and has a mission to restore the world, helping other characters (through quests) so that they return to believe in the power of Mana, thus restoring the divine tree

One thing worth noting is that this game is completely non-linear. There is no story line or direct motivation on the part of the protagonist. The story and the world progress through quests that involve different game characters in the most diverse adventures (from finding a hammer for a blacksmith to defeating a gigantic tyrant dragon). This can give a sense of meaninglessness to the plot, but for those who pay attention, you will see that this is not the case. Furthermore, I dare say that there are 3 major stories, just to speak: the story of the Jumi Knights (beings that have jewels on their chests that work like a heart and are quite powerful), the story of the dragons (Larc, Sierra and Drakonis) and the story of the rivalry between humans and demons (Escad, Daena, Matilda and Irwin). By completing any of these journeys, you open the way to the end of the game, inside the Mana Tree itself.

Yoko Shimomura did an exquisite job on the soundtrack to this game and it's easily one of the best tracks I've ever seen in an RPG, so much so that this game is both one of my favorite RPGs (along with Chrono Cross) and one of my favorite games

This game features achievements for each of the game's 67 missions (68 if you count the last one), an achievement for each boss, and those miscellaneous ones to give it a refresh in the standard gameplay. You could say it's the same as the achievements of the Steam remaster version, but I guarantee you: it's not. I've completed all challenges on both RA and Steam and the RA version has a lot more content. However, the challenges are fair and you won't spend a lot of time stuck on a boss, as long as you understand some essential game mechanics like the equipment forging and the instrument forging. There are specific tutorials on the internet for these 2, including a forge simulator, for you to test any recipe to create your items and see what happens! It's a lot of fun to play with the forge and create super powerful weapons with over 300 power!

Protip: stay tuned with 4 very important things! First, there are a lot of quests to miss in this game, so revisit areas whenever possible and talk to important characters at all times! You never know when something new might come up! Second, always after each event, talk to the cactus and report to it, as you can only report the most recent completed event to it! Third, the placement of artifacts is of paramount importance! There are 3 events that depend solely on the levels of certain mana spirits in certain locations, so keep an eye out for the tutorial on how artifacts influence others around you! And fourth, in Duma Desert, there are chests that can only be collected during 2 specific quests that take place there, if you don't collect one of them, you will lose the achievement and have to try again in a new game!

And, of course, the biggest tip of all: have multiple saves (both save states and game saves) at different points in the story. This helps a lot to avoid the frustration of having lost an item or event and having to lose progress or having to play everything from 0!

Have fun, guys!

## ~Prototype~ Clueless: Fashion! (Nintendo DS)

- Set by: {% rauserpic pinguupinguu %}, {% rauserpic SporyTike %}
- Writeup by: {% rauserpic Soulsderfuchs %}

The story of how Clueless: Fashion came to be is an interesting one. Made as a tie in to the movie Clueless (1995), it was announced in 2008, alongside two other Nintendo DS Games that similarly never saw the light of day: Mean Girls and Pretty in Pink. All three games were based on the teen comedy flicks by Paramount Digital Entertainment, ranging from the 80s to the early 2000s. The game was scheduled to be released on January 2009 in North America, but due to unknown reasons, the game was never actually released. Even some sites such as ESRB and Glyphic Entertainment's official website still claim the game was released at that time.

Now let's talk about how the game actually came to be playable today. On March 25, 2021 the Youtuber Bobdunga made a documentary about these lost games called "The Girl Games Of Lost Media (Part 1) - Documentary" where she documents the history and troubled development of the aforementioned games. Through a documentary, she spread news that she did infact came into possession of Clueless Fashion and shared gameplay of the game on her channel.
Well when the set got released as a collab between SporyTike and Pinguu. I saw potential in the game and I was the first one to jump on it day one. The game is typical shovelware and unrefined due to not being a final product, but It's actually a pretty decent time waster. If you ever played a Surgery game or a minigame similar to it like the Biology class on Bully, you will get a similar idea of what the core mechanic of the game is: using the stylus to stitch clothes together, The story follows Cher on her rise to become a Fashionista star with increased challenges on the styles and clothes she must make. The set covers everything the game has to offer from start to end and you can finish the main story mode while culminating on the most challenging test of fortitude a game like this can throw at you: make six dresses in a row without failing, done on the longest and hardest design available. This task is soul crushing but the game rewards you with one of the better soundtracks that I have ever listened to  in a DS game.  With each dress completed, the soundtracks goes from calm pop music to hard metal signifying that this is the moment of truth where you either complete the last dress or you fail as a Fashionista and must start from the first dress again. 

This achievement will most likely take you 30 minutes of precise control of the tools and the DS tactile controls, so you better be ready! Now, the end game of the game isn't about finishing the main story and becoming a star.  If you noticed throughout your journey, you can buy all kinds of items, ranging from base patterns, different colored fabrics, to even contracts from models. Now,  you must earn enough money to basically buy all the stock of all the Beverly Hill's stores. This is not, and I must say again, a free points game. You will end up grinding for hours on end the same task to earn enough money. After completing the main story and collectibles, you must  get a Perfect rating on every single task. I must say this is not a set for the faint of heart, but if you feel like facing a good challenge, or think you are a hardcore gamer that can face anything a game can throw at you, then this is the set for you. I enjoyed my time with it. Even if you don't want to go for the mastery, I recommend giving the game a try, as you'll end up having a lot of fun. If this game was actually released and polished during its time, it would have been an actual classic.

The DS Lego games are the front-runners in the mindless style of children’s games.  Each game has an ease and accessibility that even the likes of the Mario series can not reach, yet it never feels dull or uninspired.  LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is the first of three in the series I had owned as a kid.  Everything about them, the soundtrack, cutscenes and overall vibe just remind me of long car rides.  The soundtrack has such a unique sound to it, being instantly recognizable.  It somehow feels like it was made with the knowledge that you would spend hours listening to it as a kid replaying the levels, trying to find new secrets or ways to break the game, or just falling asleep with your DS open at your side.
  
The cutscenes portray events in the movie while maintaining the humor that would be seen later in the Lego movies.  While never having a line of dialogue, I was able to understand the story of the games without having watched the movies.  The game stays incredibly laidback throughout the entirety of it.  Deaths result in minimal setback, respawning you where you died only leaving behind a couple of studs, the game's currency.  Puzzles never require too much thought as they usually just require switching to a different character to use their specific ability.  This is even made easier by having the character you need’s portrait flashing on the bottom screen.  Speaking of the bottom screen, the game never feels intrusive with touch controls.  Most actions that are done on the touch screen can also just be done by pressing the Y button, removing the requirement of ever pulling out the stylus.  The only other time the bottom screen is used is as an expansion of the top down driving segments, adding more verticality to them.  These sections aren’t overly frequent and are generally at the very least bearable, but still the least fun part of the game.
  
Sticking with the laid back feel of the game, the set by pinguupinguu isn’t ridden with precise or difficult challenges, rather just asking the player to more or less fully experience everything in the game.  I highly recommend this set to anyone who wants to take a break from all the challenge of life and just have some mindless fun.

## ~Hack~ Pokemon FireRed: Rocket Edition (Game Boy Advance)

- Set by: {% rauserpic voiceofautumn %}

In Pokemon FireRed: Rocket Edition, you play the role of a new member of the criminal gang Team Rocket, committing petty crimes and following orders from higher ups rather then taking on a grand adventure to be the very best. Along the way you'll make new "friends", gain a reputation as a dangerous criminal, and even uncover a few mysteries surrounding a pair of young up-and-coming Trainers and Rocket Boss Giovanni's past.

The game's main draw is that, as a criminal, you'll be largely shunned by the population and denied services. Gate guards will block your path, Pokémon Gym assistants will shoo you as soon as you enter their gyms, and other citizens who are normally generous will refuse to hand out gifts (Though, amusingly enough, Pokémon Centers will still accept you with open arms. Even the dregs of society deserve basic care!). The biggest obstacle, however, is that stores will not allow you to purchase goods. This means no reliable access to healing items, exploration tools, and most importantly Poke Balls. A Pokémon Trainer who can't catch any Pokémon won't get very far.

This is where Rocket Edition's new mechanic comes in: Beating trainers in battle allows you to steal one of their Pokémon (With some caveats). This changes how the game is played pretty significantly. Instead of capturing creatures on your own and showing them love and care to make them stronger, Pokémon are now disposable, and only useful until you manage to snag something stronger to replace it with. The steep level curve means that battles are not only difficult, but highly rewarding as you'll be able to turn around and take a Pokémon that gave you problems and turn it into someone else's problem.

Admittedly, the game's last act is poorly executed, causing the carefully-crafted theft system to fall apart, and much of the game's writing is trite, with many jokes sitting at varying degrees of poor taste, but I believe any Pokémon fan looking for a breath of fresh air should strongly consider joining Team Rocket's ranks, even if just for a bit.

- Writeup by: {% rauserpic Wimpyfox %}

Sonic R is one of those sonic games with a relatively awful reputation, which isn’t totally unjustified. The biggest issue with the game I’ve heard from critics is the strange/bad controls which I feel somewhat stems from a misunderstanding of the way you are intended to play the game, the characters seem at first to play like any other platformer, which makes their weak turning and overall stiff movement incredibly jarring. But you must remember, this is a racing game, not a platformer, therefore you must control the characters as such, and once you recognize this and become familiar with the tracks, this game suddenly becomes a lot more fun, at least in my opinion. 

And that leads me to the Achievement set for this game, as with most Sonic games, Sonic R is a game that becomes a lot better as you the player get better at it, and this set practically forces you to master every element of the game to complete it. The game has insanely unbalanced characters, and this set will force you to play as the worst of the worst, playing this way is a real challenge, and is something you would most likely never really choose to do else wise, but once you become competent with these terrible characters and switch back to any of the good ones, it’s the equivalent of training with weighted clothing on and finally being able to take it off. Making the at first painstakingly annoying controls, seem like a breeze and a whole lot more fun once you’ve learnt how to use them correctly and are familiar with all the track layouts and shortcuts. If this set didn’t exist, I feel as if I would never have appreciated this game for the fun you can potentially have with it, as without the achievements this game is insanely short, giving the player little time to adapt to anything before 100%ing it.

If you’re like me, and you just played this game for ten minutes and immediately dropped it due to the off-putting controls, I recommend giving the game a second try with this set.

Although RetroAchievements has no shortage of Pokémon sets, and hacks of Pokémon games, Rubicate went the extra mile with this particular one. He actually dug into Pokémon Red and created a whole new hack based on challenges. Using a code-based system, any player can create any number of unique challenges in this hack, not counting the ones in the RA set mentioned here. And boy, does this set have some challenges. A good half of the set is your typical monotype challenges, like with the Pokémon Midori set. However, with “Reg Red”, it is a little more forgiving with what you can and cannot do before being locked out of the achievements. After these come the creative ones, from Team Rocket (you play by stealing other trainers Pokémon), Discount Ditto (you only have a Ditto with 4 mimic moves), No Exp, Roguelike (permadeath), and many others. The de facto “just-how-good-at-Gen-1-are-you?” challenge here is known as Rip and Tear, and it cranks up all the trainer’s Pokémon by 300%, including the elite 4. This set is most certainly not meant for the beginner if one intends to master it. A wealth of knowledge and experience is required before entering this set of challenges. Come for the monotypes. Stay for the four unique Brock challenges, and enjoy your time with this set!

- Set + Writeup by: {% rauserpic BigWeedSmokerMan %}

When people think of beat ‘em ups, they’re likely reminded of games such as Battletoads, Streets of Rage, TMNT, or Final Fight. However for a lucky few their minds may wander back to the Sega Saturn classic hybrid Beat ‘em Up/RPG: Guardian Heroes. This combination of genres was both a welcome and uncommon experience for the time.  

Gameplay is as fast paced and combo-heavy as any great Beat ‘em Up should be. Players will find themselves thinking about spacing, punishing and combo-stringing similar to a fighting game, while at the same time managing stats by placing skill points at the end of each stage. Of the five playable Story Mode characters each have their own special abilities that scale with their class-specific stats. In addition to stats and character-specific abilities, the game also features a karma system, if it wasn’t RPG enough for you yet. 
   
The story begins with your rag tag party of five awakening the legendary Undead Hero, a golden-armored skeleton with powerful abilities. The party realizes they are able to command the Undead Hero, and set out on their journey to discover the truth. There are several different paths you can take to traverse the total of thirty stages, leading to an eventual seven different endings. Four of the seven endings rely on the karma system, so if you want to see them all, you’ll have to be a bit naught and a bit nice.  
  
The amount of sprites on screen possible for the Saturn feels almost like a modern beat ‘em up with a retro look. The art is unique, rarely repeating assets throughout its massive thirty stages, the character design mirrors this attention to detail with unique and interesting visuals and back stories for each. The OST is nothing to sneeze at, either, whether you’re in the mood to shred, or to bounce around to an eclectic jazz saxophone, it’s got you covered.  
  
When I decided to make a set for Guardian Heroes, I admittedly had never heard of the series, but I quickly learned why it was the top requested game for the Saturn. It took me on a journey of beat ‘em up badassery and RPG thought provoking fun, and really showed me what I was missing by ignoring the Saturn’s library for so many years. If you like punching, kicking, and skeletons that you can tell to yell really loud, check out Guardian Heroes.


## Star Ocean: The Second Story

Welcome to the vast Ocean of the Stars, better known as Star Ocean: The Second Story!

This is a wonderful gem of a game and one of my favorite RPGs released on the PSX.

The story takes place 20 years after the first game, and you can choose to play as either Claude C. Kenni, or Rena Lanford. Claude gets sent to the planet Expel near the village of Arlia by accident and runs into Rena who is being attacked by a monster. Heroic as Claude wants to be, he decides to save her by using his Phase Gun. Because of this, Rena mistakes him to be the 'Hero of Light', who has come to save the planet from the disasters taking place on it caused by the Sorcery Globe. The Sorcery Globe was believed to have been a mysterious meteor that crashed into Expel a few months ago, corrupting the land and the animals around it, turning them into evil demons. Claude eventually convinces Rena and the mayor of Arlia that he is not the Hero of Light, but he would still like to investigate this Sorcery Globe, which is located on the continent of El. They set out on their journey and meet various people along the way who join them in their quest. After a long journey they finally arrive at the continent of El and find Eluria Tower where the town of Eluria used to be. Here they learn the truth behind the events of the Sorcery Globe, and the people behind it...

The game has a lot of character interactions, and you can develop better relations between your party members by completing so called 'Private Actions (PA)'. This is a very important factor during the game, as it affects the endings and whether or not you can get a 'paired' ending between party members. Did I mention there are 86(!) endings? You won't be able to see all of them in one playthrough, but the game has plenty of replayability since you can't recruit every party member in one playthrough either. Besides manipulating the endings, affection levels between your characters can also be used as a requirement to see certain PAs in the game. Additionally, it's even a factor in combat. Rena for example, will heal and support a party member she likes more than other characters!

Also returning in this game is Item Creation. There is a wide availability of items that can be created, and characters can learn Talents to help them successfully create the items. A character can learn Specialties as well once they distribute enough points in certain Skills. This will again help them further during Item Creation and additionally also boosts a character's stats (HP, MP, STR, DEF, etc.) In order to level these Skills, you need Skill Points. These are obtained once a character levels up. The higher the level they become, the more SP they get per level-up.

If you thought you were done after beating the game - Think again... A few more challenges await you. The legendary Cave of Trials (Maze of Tribulations) unlocks once you save at the final save point of the game. This is a bonus dungeon that holds some of the most powerful enemies in the game, including one of the optional super bosses. On top of all that, if you were completing Private Actions, you may have found a way to make the final boss immensely stronger. Do you have what it takes to complete these challenges?

There is also a feature called 'Voice Collection'. In Star Ocean 2 your characters have various lines during combat. Whether they get hurt, attack an enemy, or support your allies, all these lines get stored in the Voice Collection. Unlock enough of the Voice Collection and you will eventually unlock Galaxy and Universe modes. These modes make the enemies more difficult. In particular in Universe mode, the enemies gain a massive boost to their stats, making it a lot more difficult and a very nice challenge.

The set covers the vast majority of the game and makes you go along on various side quests and challenges as well. There are interesting boss challenges and there's even an arena to complete. As previously mentioned, you will eventually unlock Universe mode. Of course there are achievements tied to doing things in this mode, so do whatever it takes to master Universe mode!

Aim for the various endings, complete the challenges, or even just watch all the character interactions during the PAs, and become part of this vast ocean! Play this set!

Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night? Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic? Have you or your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost? If the answer is "yes", then don't wait another minute! Grab your backup rom copy of Ghostbusters for the NES, apply the Ghostbusters Remastered patch, and **Play This Set!**

The original [Ghostbusters (NES)](https://retroachievements.org/game/1709) game is based on the 1984 blockbuster movie of the same name and was designed by the legendary David Crane (the designer of [Pitfall!](https://retroachievements.org/game/11191) and [A Boy and His Blob](https://retroachievements.org/game/1590)). Propelled by the success of the movie, the game was widely ported to many systems where it garnered solid reviews and sold quite well initially. Being a **huge** Ghostbusters fan, and the fact Ghostbusters was one of the first NES games in my limited collection, I played the game often despite its flaws. I’ll admit that the biggest issue for me was that I wanted ghost busting action and the game was more of a business simulation with action mini games. I could get over the sub-par graphics of washed-out greys, greens, and blues with very little animation. I was just learning to read and write so didn’t notice that the game was full of poor grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors including the infamous misspelling of *“conglaturation”* when you win the game. That misspelling is something I never would have seen as a child since I always died climbing the stairs before the final confrontation with Gozer on the roof tops. Unlike other ports of the game, the NES version didn’t allow you to shoot the ghosts to stun them so you had to avoid the ghosts' horrible hit detection while climbing the stairs. Before the advent of walkthroughs to help me through this mess, I instead ended up moving on to better games.

When I saw that [~hack~ Ghostbusters Remastered (NES)](https://retroachievements.org/game/14692) was part of the *Unwanted* games selection I had to try it out to see if they improved the game. I was pleasantly surprised to find that NESRocks addressed many of the above criticisms while keeping the core gameplay the same. The most noticeable improvement is almost all of the graphics have been updated with many of the new assets coming from the superior Famicom version of Ghostbusters 2. Under the hood, a lot of the grindy elements have been streamlined and the shop prices are more reasonable with some of the items being fully refundable! The controls and hit detection have been greatly improved as well which makes the stairs section possible without needing to buy the most expensive shop items or rely on a programming glitch. After so many years, I was finally able to save the world and millions of registered voters. Overall, the remastered experience greatly improves the game and shows that the original game design wasn’t bad, just poorly implemented and ported.

The achievements for Ghostbusters Remastered incorporate memorable quotes from the movie and encourage many different playstyles that I would not have attempted normally. They add challenges like a speed run to enter Zuul’s building as quickly as possible to earn [Are You the Keymaster?](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/129051) Alternately, you could try to make as much money as possible before the world ends to become [Rich Beyond Our Wildest Dreams!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/129042) You’re also rewarded for changing up the build order and buying the more expensive shop items first while [Cleanin' Up the Town!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/129047) If you’re up for a real challenge, try attempting the damageless boss fight with Gozer and be one of the few who have unlocked [This Chick is TOAST!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/129060) The combination of this stellar set and great remaster has redeemed a game that I gave up on so long ago.
