## Spot the Difference

Today Bijou saw a wonderful rainbow and another Ham-Ham, Prince Bo, fell down from it because his magical umbrella, which allows him to create rainbow, loses its colors. It seems like that the same thing which caused the umbrella to lose the colors also changed several objects in the Ham-Ham base. Can you find all 10 differences in the lower image?
