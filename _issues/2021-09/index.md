## Intro

**Wow!** Looks like people got excited with the 1st anniversary and submitted a lot of content for us last month!

That's awesome guys! It truly boosts our enthusiasm to keep working on this.

:heart:

This month we have some new and exciting stuff, keep reading...


## Quick Overview

What to expect from this issue. First checking what's new...


### What's new?




#### PSP First Look

Yeah! That's exactly what you're thinking: we're about to start supporting PlayStation Portable!

Our Nerd Guru {% rauser Jamiras %} is still trimming some edges and our brave achievement creators are already testing the new system and working on new sets. PSP will be officially supported soon. Stay tuned!

In the **PSP First Look** article {% rauser StingX2 %} shares with us the achievement sets that will come soon.

#### Wish This Set

If you're a typical RANews reader you're already familiar with the Play-This-Set, right? That's where people try to convince other members to play an existing set.

Wish this set has a similar purpose, but it's intended to convince other members to request a game that doesn't have an achievement set yet.

[For those who don't know, if a game doesn't have achievements, you can Request a set for it by clicking in the `Request Set` link in the game's page.]

#### RAdvantage

A new segment where community members share their tricks about challenging achievements.

Really cool content produced by our members. There are even videos showing their strategies!


#### RASpotlight

A new segment where we want to poke into the brain of a RA community member with an interview.

Debuting with the most prolific achievement creator on this planet (and now retired): [Salsa](raspotlight).


#### RAnniversaries

Highlighting the members who have been with us and for how long.


### Traditional Segments

#### Editorial

Is quality really a destination?

I'm sharing some toughts about quality and spicing it with a little of RALore.

#### DevNews

What's going on in the Achievement Creation scene.


#### Play This Set

Community members talking about their favorite sets and why you should play them. Cool stuff!



#### RAGuide

This month our official RAGuide Curator {% rauser ViperZang %} picked guide from {% rauser Schlim %}. It'll show you how to wax on, wax off in Karate Kid (Atari 2600).


#### Current Events

List of running events in the RetroAchievements scene that are still open to join.


#### HotCheevs Monthly

#### Revisions and Rescores

#### Top Masteries

#### Top Players

Some statistics about the top 300 players of RetroAchievements and how they progressed over the last month.
