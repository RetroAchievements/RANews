## Announcing PSP's Launch Window Library

After years of inspirational quotes from Abraham Lincoln, Ghandi, and Marmaduke telling us 'PSP is All We Need', I'm proud to announce on behalf of Jamiras, KickMeElmo, televandalist, QA Team, and, of course, our brothers from the [libretro project](https://www.libretro.com/), your launch window releases for the Playstation Portable system. 

This is our 35th system on RetroAchievements, and we couldn't be more proud of all the hardwork these developers have put into their sets so far behind the scenes!

In this article you're going to see the games our achievement creators are working on and a quick description of the game.

Some sets have already been completed, and will be available upon the console's release to RetroAchievements! Some others are still under development.

Official release is planned for late September or early October, so stay tuned!

**NOTE:** These are *currently active claims* and are subject to change at any time.

**Mega Man Maverick Hunter X**

- By: GalacticSpear and AlexGatao
- **Available At PSP Launch!**

> Have you played the first Mega Man X title? Well at one point Capcom was interested in remaking the original few X games to match the more modern Playstation style. They only got this one out though and it even included a semi-retconned origin in the form of a new anime OVA included. The game is essentially the same as the first game but now when you beat it you can play the new Vile mode in an alternate What If? story.


**LocoRoco: Midnight Carnival**

- By: SporyTike
- **Available At PSP Launch!**

> Locoroco Midnight Carnival is a wacky, yet creative platformer that utilizes the use of only the L and R buttons! Using these buttons let you tilt the world to adjust where your yellow blob goes. Hold them both to jump to your prize!


**Initial D: Street Stage**

- By: Lewis50248
- **Available At PSP Launch!**

> Do you like Ridge Racer? Do you like Anime characters? This psp title has the high action seen in most Ridge Racer games with an anime heavy soundtrack.


**Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions**

- By: siouxerskate

> A grand remake of the Playstation 1 classic that rebalances the content, puts a pretty coat of paint and really gives players the definitive version of the Final Fantasy Tactics series. And yes Final Fantasy VII fans, Cloud Strife is still in the game.



**Black Rock Shooter: The Game**

- By: MGNS8M

> Ever wanted to play a turn based shooter rpg? Taking the concept previously used by Parasite Eve and adding a dash of anime to get this recipe. Fun Fact, this is one of 16 possible releases on the PSP that came out after RetroAchievements was formed.



**Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection**

- By: SnowPin and Ryudo
- **Available At PSP Launch!**

> The classic fourth entry in Final Fantasy gets a beautiful definitive version for the psp that some would say is the true Pixel Remaster. Also included aside from the base game is Interlude and the After Years. The latter is the fully fledged sequel that many didn't get to play when it was released on the WiiWare service.



**Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep Final Mix**

- By: AlmightyXor

> Find out what happened before Kingdom Hearts 1 following the stories of Aqua, Ventus, and Terra around incidents that occurred during the Mark of Mastery exam. This version of Birth By Sleep has more of everything from attacks to arena missions and even a Bonus Secret Episode!



**Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA**

- By: lordpsycho
- **Available At PSP Launch!**

> Hatsune Miku is a Rhythm game about a vocaloid. Mash the right buttons to timing and listen to some pop.



**Ys Seven**

- By: DanielARP

> Ys Seven is an extremely under rated and forgotten entry in the series that is a killer app for the PSP. Featuring multiple party combinations and faster than ever game play, this is one action RPG you cannot miss.



**Dynasty Warriors**

- By: Bearfax62

> Dynasty Warriors isn't a port of one of the console editions and instead is considered a spinoff title from the mainline series. All the classic features of the franchise are present though!



## Second Row

**The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky**

- By: televandalist
- **Available At PSP Launch!**

> The first game in the Legend of Heroes subseries that some say is the Marvel Cinematic Universe of RPGs. The beauty of this franchise is found in how everything matters from simple townspeople to major story events. The entire world grows and evolves with the player in this first entry.


**Echochrome**

- By: Tybis

> A game with minimalistic graphics and perception, Echochrome is a puzzle game about controlling a stick figure man touching the other shadows of himself in the world. What makes it magical is the focus on how the world changes by the angle we see it. At one angle a corner is a pit, and at another corner its a pathway.

**Mortal Kombat: Unchained**

- By: zxmega

> Unchained is a renamed version of Deception for the PSP handheld. Unlike other handheld Mortal Kombat attempts of the past this one is a faithful adaptation of the PS2 era classic.

**Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters**

- By: Infernox

> The often forgotten Size Matters is a full Ratchet and Clank adventure focusing on as many tiny jokes and scenarios as it can. The game features all the 3rd person shooter combat and comedy that the main console versions.

**Tenchu: Shadow Assassins**

- By: blendedsea

> The final game in the main Tenchu series, Shadow Assassins is considered best on PSP. If you like stealth and planning, then you will be at home with Shadow Assassins.

> One of the hardest franchises returns on the PSP with a reimagining of the first game. Just be warned only the strong survive and only those that collect everything get to actually see the ending!

**Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords**

- By: TeddyWestside

> What happens when an RPG has a baby with Bejeweled's match 3 concept? You get the epic Puzzle Quest. Difficult but always intriguing, play the game that started an entire subgenre of its own.


**Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure**

- By: Kayesay

> Gurumin is a Legend of Zelda clone where your main character is armed with a stick...with a drill on the end of it! Filled to the brim with adorable and cute, this hidden gem will excite many Nintendo fans seeking familiarity.

**Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together**

> Tactics Ogre takes place after Ogre Battle SNES but at the same time as Ogre Battle 64. This is a remaster of the original game of the same name that launched in the late 1990s. The DNA of games like Final Fantasy Tactics are rooted in the Ogre series. While it may seem daunting those that venture inside come out all smiles.

**LocoRoco 2**

- By: Etron

> Although the sequel to the first game was the third game released for the system, this one adds in new abilities like swimming to the yellow blobs arsenal.

**Half-Minute Hero**

- By: msdmario

> You have 30 seconds to save the world can you do it? Filled with comedy and chaos, Half Minute Hero is a wildly different take on the RPG format. Each stage is its own miniature rpg and the way to victory unfolds more like a puzzle than your standard RPG game. With multiple modes, and alternate paths take Half Minute Hero for a short spin.


**LittleBigPlanet**

- By: ZZKer
