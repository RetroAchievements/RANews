# 2) Introduction

The Legend of Heroes IV: A Tear of Vermillion is a role-playing game originally developed by [Nihon Falcom Corporation](https://nihon-falcom.fandom.com/wiki/Nihon_Falcom_Corporation). It is the first game in regards to the timeline in the "Gagharv Trilogy", a trilogy spanning three games with [The Legend of Heroes II: Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch](https://retroachievements.org/game/3563) and [The Legend of Heroes III: Song of the Ocean](https://retroachievements.org/game/3567). The localization did mess a bit with the chronological order, but it is commonly accepted for A Tear of Vermillion to be the first in the trilogy. This series is known to be the predecessor to the sixth game in the The Legend of Heroes series, Trails in the Sky, which is now commonly knows as the Trails series.

This achievement set is created by developer [ladynadiad](https://retroachievements.org/user/ladynadiad), who has done an excellent job covering everything the game has to offer. There are a lot of missable achievements in this set that are chronologically ordered on the game page, but I wanted to emphasise on them further by introducing a completely spoiler-free guide. This guide hides all the story achievements in a toggle with the amount described, making it so that this guide can be approached without the worry that you will be spoiling yourself. For example, if the toggle says 2 achievements, then everything between this toggle and the next toggle can be gained in-between that time. If you are a veteran of the series however, you are most likely familiar with how this game handles missables: talking to every NPC after every major happening in the story. By following this approach, most if not all achievements shouldn't be a problem for you!

# 3) Walkthrough

### [**Step 1: Chapter 1**](#step-1-chapter-1--total-points-64)

This step covers all the achievements that can be obtained during chapter 1 in chronological order of when you can first get them. There are a total of four missable achievements, though chapter two still allows you to revisit most of the places from chapter one, meaning that if you missed one, you can still get it then. There are only two real missable achievements to watch out for that can only be obtained during chapter 1, namely Gingko Round Dance and Rookie Treasure Hunter, but these are all four:

- [Gingko Round Dance](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197982) - Has to be done before reaching the capital for the first time.
- [The Unofficial History of El Phildin](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/198670) - Is available for the whole chapter after entering Phildin, as well as the start of chapter 2. Possibly chapter 3 as well, but don't quote me on that.
- [Opening of War](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197985) - Is available for the whole chapter after the second Adventurer's Guild task, as well as the start of chapter 2.
- [Rookie Treasure Hunter](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197989) - While it can technically be finished in chapter 2, it is recommended to do this before the end of chapter 1 due to the first area listed in the achievement becoming inaccessible after chapter 1 ends. The point of no return is upon finishing the Prayer Woods.

**Chapter 1's point of no return is after the Prayer Woods.**

***

### [**Step 2: Chapter 2**](#step-2-chapter-2--total-points-138)

This step covers all the achievements that can be obtained during chapter 2 in chronological order of when you can first get them. Unlike chapter 1 however, your breathing room for missable achievements is decreased by quite a lot. Whenever you leave a town or a route, be under the assumption that you cannot go back to them whatsoever. Therefore, every missable achievement is also truly missable. Check them out in the following order:

- [Winner!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197990) - Must be done before leaving Borun.
- [The Swordsmaster](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197992) - Must be done before leaving for New Borun.
- [Business Influencer](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197999) - Must be done before leaving for Guia.
- [Wandering With Wind](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197998) - Involves the Karamus and Jyamane events. Read the "Other important events" segment of Step 1 and 2 carefully for this. Must be done before leaving for Guia.
- [A Change of Plan](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/198000) - Involves the Karamus and Jyamane events. Read the "Other important events" segment of Step 1 and 2 carefully for this. Must be done before leaving for Koruna.
- [Autumn Rain](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/198001) - Must be done before going back to Koruna after leaving the Sorcerer's School.
- [A Well Earned Reward](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/198002) - Must be done before leaving for Balloa.
- [The Witchcraft Master](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197996) - Needs to be done during a specific spoiler event in Balloa.
- [A Joyful Reunion](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/198003) - Needs to be done during a specific spoiler event in Balloa.
- [Interception](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/198004) - Must be done before leaving for the Silver Mine.
- [Save the Miners and Make History!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/198777) - The game is buggy at this part, so read the achievement carefully. In the Silver Mine, right tunnel first, then left.
- [Knowledge of the Enemy](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199009) - Can be done after first arriving at Valkd, as well as early Chapter 3.
- [Gawaine the Hero](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/200253) - Must be done before going back to Theta after leaving Valkd.
- [Dark Eyes](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199554) - Involves the Karamus and Jyamane events. Read the "Other important events" segment of Step 1 and 2 carefully for this. Must be done before leaving for Truth Island.
- [Experienced Treasure Hunter](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199760) - The chests achievement of Chapter 2. You get very few chances to revisit the roads, so be sure to do everything on your first visit.

**Chapter 2's point of no return is after leaving Dorx.**

***

### [**Step 3: Chapter 3 and 4**](#step-3-chapter-3-and-4--total-points-234)

This step covers all the achievements that can be obtained during chapter 3 and 4 in chronological order of when you can first get them. Like chapter 2, the breathing room for missable achievements isn't too big. Leaving a town or route can very well mean that you will not be able to get it again, so do be wary. Check them out in the following order:

**Chapter 3**
- [A Turn For the Worse](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199761) - Must be done before going to Quitt Village
