<p>Hello! I’m Laura and today I wanted to talk about a rhythm game that I only started playing because of Retro Achievements, which is Dance Dance Revolution(or DDR). Most of the sets follow the same formula, and there are some tips that helps you heavily with the whole series if you want to master it.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-a-lot-of-games-here-and-a-few-main-differences-you-should-know-is">There Are a Lot of Games Here, and a Few Main Differences You Should Know Is</h2>

<p>The PS1 and Dreamcast games runs in 30 fps, and the ps2 ones in 60fps. When it comes to the PS1 titles, you can change the EE/Cycle Rate of the emulator to 300% to play it on 60fps, however you can’t do this in the first one <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/18260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dance Dance Revolution (USA)</a>, only in the courses, so keep that in mind.</p>

<h1 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h1>

<p>Also, in DDR there’s a mechanic called “Modifiers”, that allows you to customize the gameplay to make it harder, easier, or just more accessible in general. I usually play with 2 modifiers enabled, the first one, is note speed, which makes the notes be more spread out on the screen so you can easily read it (I usually play with 2x note speed). I also use the Reverse Scroll option, since Guitar Hero was the first rhythm game I ever played, i’m used to notes coming from top to bottom of the screen when it comes to Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Games. The latter, is a matter of personal preference, but the former really makes things easier, and those 2 modifiers I mentioned are not present in most of the PS1 entries. You can enable them by holding down the Circle button before starting a song(If this didn’t worked, either the game has a different way to use modifiers, or does not feature them.)</p>

<p>Where do I start?
I imagine that this is probably the question that makes people confused the most, since there’s 36 games to master. I started with <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/18260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dance Dance Revolution (USA)</a>, but I do not recommend it for a few reasons. When you don’t have any muscle memory regarding this series, its easier to become good at it in a game that feels nicer to play. With that said, I would start with this one:</p>

<p><a class="gameicon-link" href="https://retroachievements.org/game/20547" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img class="gameicon" src="https://retroachievements.org/Images/063473.png" /> <span>Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (Japan)</span></a></p>

<p>The first reason is that to get good at rhythm games a nice route to take is to play a lot of different songs so your brain can get used to various types of Patterns. and DDR Extreme got you covered with 110 songs!! It also has all the modifiers I mentioned above, which will make it easier for you to improve on the game. The achievements only requires AA ranks(getting a high precision) instead of Full Combos(not missing any notes), and features achievements both for Standard Play(medium difficulty) as well as Heavy(hard difficulty), so you can score a lot of points on the set even if you just started playing it.</p>

<h1 id="control-scheme">Control Scheme</h1>

<p>Many people wonder what a good setup to play DDR would be. Personally I prefer using the keyboard instead of a gamepad when it comes to DDR. And yes, you can get the achievements on any hardware you want(Keyboard, gamepad, arcade stick, dance pad). I use different control schemes for Standard and Double gamemodes, and do not worry, I will explain those in a few. My setup is the following:</p>

<h2 id="standard">Standard</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Left arrow(Left d-pad): W  
Down arrow(Down d-pad):E  
Up arrow(Up d-pad): Numpad 7  
Right arrow(Right d-pad): Numpad 8  
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="menu-navigation">Menu Navigation</h3>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Cross: Numpad 5 (To go back)  
Circle: Numpad 6 (To confirm)  
Start: Enter  
Select: Backspace  
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="double">Double</h2>

<h3 id="p1-slot">P1 Slot</h3>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Left arrow(Left d-pad): W  
Down arrow(Down d-pad):E  
Up arrow(Up d-pad): Numpad 7  
Right arrow(Right d-pad): Numpad 8  
Start: Enter  
Select: Backspace  
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="p2-slot">P2 Slot</h3>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Left arrow(Square): Numpad 4  
Down arrow(Cross):Numpad 5  
Up arrow(Triangle): Numpad 8  
Right arrow(Circle): Numpad 6  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Circle and Cross here serves as menu navigation as well.</p>

<h1 id="should-i-go-for-the-master">Should I Go for the Master?</h1>

<p>DDR Masteries are complicated. you may do 99% of the set in 3 hours, and then just one song will prevent you from mastering it. If you see on my profile, there are a lot of unfinished DDR games, and i’m fine with that. I got my first DDR mastery 18 days ago, and now I have five. It’s a domino effect. Just keep grinding and eventually the masteries will all fall on your hands. Personally i’m not a fan of retrying the same song 400 times, so that feels more natural and fun to me. Feel free to experiment!</p>

<h1 id="styles">Styles</h1>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Standard</td>
      <td>The “main” style on the game. You just play with 4 arrows and can use modifiers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Double</td>
      <td>The expert style of the game. Instead of 4 arrows, you get 8. However, remember that this game was meant to be played with your feet, so the game will only ever require 2 notes at the same time. I hope this reduces your fear to try it out. I never played it before, and since the game has a lot of easy songs, so the difficulty curve felt natural to improve. Now a days its my favorite one as well!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h1 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h1>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Beginner</td>
      <td>The easiest charts in the game.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Light</td>
      <td>Easy mode. Can be used to learn if Standard is hard for you.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Standard</td>
      <td>Medium mode. Usually what you will start with.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Heavy</td>
      <td>Hard mode. The last main difficulty.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Challenge</td>
      <td>the Courses mode. You will have to play a specific amount of songs in a row(The average is 4 to 20), and you can only have 4 misses per song. It can be a little different depending on which entry you’re playing, but the idea still’s the same.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Nonstop</td>
      <td>The same as challenge, but with the normal health bar instead of the 4 misses per song like Challenge.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>PS: Beginner, Light, Standard, and Heavy names can change depending on the version you’re playing.</p>

<p>Nonstop mode is the HARDEST game mode for me. Not only because of the 4 misses, but also because when i’m at a 20 songs course and I start to reach the end, my heartbeat rate increases, and I start to miss more. Usually you’re gonna save this for last. Muscle memory WILL be required. You also can’t use ANY modifier on this mode(A good way to practice for courses is mastering PS1 DDR’s since most of them forces you to use 1.0 speed)</p>

<h1 id="options">Options</h1>

<p>There are a few options that I recommend you to change when it comes to getting achievements(I’ll only talk about the important options, since there’s a lot of stuff.)</p>

<h2 id="sound-options">Sound Options</h2>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Voice</td>
      <td>Turns the announcer on or off. If hearing “YOU’RE NOT AN ORDINARY FELLA!” during your plays distracts you, here is where you can turn it off. You can also disable only the booing as well. Personally the announcer hypes me up a little so I leave it on.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Timing</td>
      <td>favorite option. Here you can adjust the timing delay. I never really felt that a lot when playing this games, but you can use this, and also emulator audio settings as well. Cassie posted her audio settings for each music on the comments in 99% of the series. If you’re retrying a song a lot, feel free to try Cassie audio options for the specific song to see if it helps a little. Saved me a few times, so shout outs to her!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="game-options">Game Options</h2>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Game Level</td>
      <td>The amount of HP you lose when you miss a note. Personally I always let it default.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Max Stage</td>
      <td>Since DDR came from the arcades, it follows the arcade formula of playing 3 songs and ending the session. If you’re going for achievements I would recommend leaving it in 5. Sometimes it will be helpful to change that to 1, when it comes to extra stage achievements like this one: <a class="gameicon-link" href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/263077" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img class="gameicon" src="https://retroachievements.org/Badge/290758.png" /> <span>The Repeating Way</span></a></td>

      <td>Game over</td>
      <td>Leaving it on default(arcade) will enable the game over when your HP goes to zero. Usually I leave it at END OF MUSIC so I can practice more freely.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Event mode</td>
      <td>Enabling it will disable the stage limits, which is optimal for getting AA rank/Full Combo achievements. I like to leave it on, just remember that the game stops autosaving when you use that option, so when you want to save, remember to press Select + Start to go back to the main menu, then go to Options&gt;Save and Load&gt;Save to make sure you don’t lose any progress.</td>

      <td>Just like the arcade, there’s a time limit for choosing a song/Difficulty. Feel free to turn that off.</td>

      <td>Movie</td>
      <td>DDR features a music video for every song. That makes the notes less readable 90% of the time, so you usually want to turn it off.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Danger Display</td>
      <td>When you’re low on health, the game will have a different music video that means you’re in danger. If you turn movie off this option becomes off as well.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Step Mark Color</td>
      <td>A REALLY important option. The TYPE 1 is the default RGB notes, and if you change it to TYPE 2, the colors are changed to mostly red and blue. Its SUPER useful for readability, since sometimes it will be hard to realize if you have to quickly press one note, and then the other, or both at the same time. TYPE 2 makes it so the color of the notes are the same if its at the same time, and when you quickly have to press two notes with a small delay between them, a yellow note will appear as well. Sometimes green notes show up but I still haven’t understood what that means. It helps A LOT in the PS1 entries and on the PS2 courses. From all the DDR mainline games I played so far, only the gameboy games and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/20547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (Japan)</a> doesn’t feature it.</td>

<h2 id="dancer-pptions">Dancer Pptions</h2>

<p>One of the most charming aspects of DDR is that it features 3d models of characters dancing along the music. Sadly, it’s a distraction when you’re trying to go for full combos, so I recommend you disable it by leaving Display Dancers in off.</p>

<h1 id="judgement">Judgement</h1>

<p>If you’re like me and started your rhythm gaming with Guitar Hero, you may not be familiar with judgement in Rhythm games. On Guitar Hero, you either hit a note or you don’t. But in most western rhythm games, it judges your timing with precision as well. MARVELOUS/GREAT/PERFECT keeps your combo going, but if you get a MISS, you will lose your combo as well as some HP, and if you get GOOD you will drop your combo, but won’t lose HP. So if you’re going for a full combo/AA ranking, keep that in mind.</p>

<p>After almost mastering one or two PS2 DDR’s and being able to play doubles, you can try to go for the PS
1 ones! They will usually range from 2 to 5 hours after you managed to get good at it.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-tips-i-could-not-fit-in-any-other-section">A Few Tips I Could Not Fit in Any Other Section</h2>

<ul>
  <li>For games that doesn’t have a reverse scroll option, you can invert your screen on your device options. If you use windows the route would be:
    <ul>
      <li>Right click on desktop &gt; Display Settings &gt; Display Orientation &gt; Landscape(Inverted)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For games that doesn’t have a note speed option: If you’re REALLY struggling with a chart, sometimes you can do a really retro technique of placing a towel on your monitor that covers half of the screen(or more) So your brain doesn’t get confused with the amount of notes. I grew up thinking people did that purely to make the game harder, but turns out it was the opposite. Less time for reaction, but can be less overwhelming for your brain as well.</li>
  <li>Rhythm games can be really nocive to your hands. You should be careful with things like carpal tunnel and tendinitis, so remember to take a 15min break every 1 hour, and there’s a lot of exercises that can make it less dangerous as well. The rubber band finger extension exercise is the one that helped me the most during this journey, and most people have rubber bands at home. If you’re feeling hand/pulse pain, please take a break!! Sometimes even a extensive one.</li>
  <li>Even tho playing in a soft dance pad is harder and wouldn’t help much in the achievement hunting, it can be a healthy exercise for you if you start to get into DDR, so I would give it a go if you have the money(Stepmania works better for that).</li>
</ul>

<p>And that concludes my RAdvantage for DDR! Thanks for reading it, and I would like to give a special shoutout to Cassievania, AmirGaris, PsyHunter29, djlain, RetroKaiser and everyone at the rhythm game community in the website!</p>
