        <h2 id="announcing-psps-launch-window-library">Announcing PSP’s Launch Window Library</h2>

<p>After years of inspirational quotes from Abraham Lincoln, Ghandi, and Marmaduke telling us ‘PSP is All We Need’, I’m proud to announce on behalf of Jamiras, KickMeElmo, televandalist, QA Team, and, of course, our brothers from the <a href="https://www.libretro.com/">libretro project</a>, your launch window releases for the Playstation Portable system.</p>

<p>This is our 35th system on RetroAchievements, and we couldn’t be more proud of all the hardwork these developers have put into their sets so far behind the scenes!</p>

<p>In this article you’re going to see the games our achievement creators are working on and a quick description of the game.</p>

<p>Some sets have already been completed, and will be available upon the console’s release to RetroAchievements! Some others are still under development.</p>

<p>Official release is planned for late September or early October, so stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These are <em>currently active claims</em> and are subject to change at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Man Maverick Hunter X</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: GalacticSpear and AlexGatao</li>
  <li><strong>Available At PSP Launch!</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you played the first Mega Man X title? Well at one point Capcom was interested in remaking the original few X games to match the more modern Playstation style. They only got this one out though and it even included a semi-retconned origin in the form of a new anime OVA included. The game is essentially the same as the first game but now when you beat it you can play the new Vile mode in an alternate What If? story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: siouxerskate</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>By: MGNS8M</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: Snow and Ryudo</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The classic fourth entry in Final Fantasy gets a beautiful definitive version for the psp that some would say is the true Pixel Remaster. Also included aside from the base game is Interlude and the After Years. The latter is the fully fledged sequel that many didn’t get to play when it was released on the WiiWare service.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>By: AlmightyXor</li>

<p><strong>Ys Seven</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: DanielARP</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ys Seven is an extremely under rated and forgotten entry in the series that is a killer app for the PSP. Featuring multiple party combinations and faster than ever game play, this is one action RPG you cannot miss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: Bearfax62</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dynasty Warriors isn’t a port of one of the console editions and instead is considered a spinoff title from the mainline series. All the classic features of the franchise are present though!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="second-row">Second Row</h2>

<p><img src="./img/psp-games-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: Tybis</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>A game with minimalistic graphics and perception, Echochrome is a puzzle game about controlling a stick figure man touching the other shadows of himself in the world. What makes it magical is the focus on how the world changes by the angle we see it. At one angle a corner is a pit, and at another corner its a pathway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Mortal Kombat: Unchained</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: zxmega</li>

<ul>
  <li>By: Infernox</li>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tenchu: Shadow Assassins</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: blendedsea</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final game in the main Tenchu series, Shadow Assassins is considered best on PSP. If you like stealth and planning, then you will be at home with Shadow Assassins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ultimate Ghosts N Goblins</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: Zpeligo</li>

<ul>
  <li>By: Kayesay</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tactics Ogre takes place after Ogre Battle SNES but at the same time as Ogre Battle 64. This is a remaster of the original game of the same name that launched in the late 1990s. The DNA of games like Final Fantasy Tactics are rooted in the Ogre series. While it may seem daunting those that venture inside come out all smiles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>LocoRoco 2</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: Etron</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the sequel to the first game was the third game released for the system, this one adds in new abilities like swimming to the yellow blobs arsenal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>By: pinguupinguu</li>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Half-Minute Hero</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By: msdmario</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have 30 seconds to save the world can you do it? Filled with comedy and chaos, Half Minute Hero is a wildly different take on the RPG format. Each stage is its own miniature rpg and the way to victory unfolds more like a puzzle than your standard RPG game. With multiple modes, and alternate paths take Half Minute Hero for a short spin.</p>
