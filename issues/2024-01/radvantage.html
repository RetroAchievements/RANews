<p>This is a run through the entire game from start to finish to beat it without dying which basically gives away most of the set achievements (except for a couple of miscellaneuous achievements); I think this needs some stratetegy specially at the bosses because you can’t get hit a lot of times. I seen playthroughts with those bosses which uses full health, which obviously won’t be the case here. So, it’s necessary to apply some cheap fighting tactics cause you won’t last long if you try to fight fair (at least in my case). First of all, finish first the game to be able to skip those cinematics that are super long cause you probably have to try this more than once, and you don’t want to see those everytime.
I will reffer to the names of the moves and chapters found on this page Link</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have trouble to put those hokuto finishing moves on later bosses (when there are like 3 hands spinning), remember that pause button is your friend. At least so far, I hope that they don’t get the idea of forbidden using pause because of this.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>

<p>You can kill most of those first lackeys you fight easily with one shot from Backhand Blow; so it won’t be a problem for now.</p>

<p><strong>Zeed (Mid boss)</strong>: For being the first sub boss, Zeed doesn’t have a counter attack of some sort, so you are free to get close to him. Kill his guards and also hit him with Backhand Blow and if there are no guards around you can instead attack him with Hundred Crack Kicks.</p>

<p><strong>Spade</strong>: Try to stay in his range otherwise he will shoot the arrows. In the first fight he has a couple of lackeys and in the second he has lackeys that join him midfight. The only protection he has is some sort of shield that blocks some attacks, but if you do Hundred Crack Kicks the last kick will always connect. In fact, you can cheap it by getting close to him when he falls down and doing the Hundred Crack Kicks as he is standing up.
The King palaces lackeys re the same as the first lackeys, but some of them can stand more than 2 of Backhand Blow. The only tip is don’t stay behind the columns in the second fight cause they can attack you without you seeing them.</p>

<p><strong>Heart</strong>: This is the first guy who has a counter, it can be unpredictable. If you want to play safe, wait for him to attack first and dodge him, then since he is slow you can attack him with Hundred Crack Kicks. If you want to attack first, there is always a chance that he will counter before you can connect him; but you can take your chances, first knock him with Backhand Blow and then do the same that you do with Spade.</p>

<p><strong>Shin</strong>: For some reason, this guy almost never connects with the previous moves, and he has a counter if you stay close. Your best course of action is to play safe, attack him with Drop Kick, which seems to be the only thing to always connects; then retreat before he counters and do it over again. If he attacks you (it will happen eventually) and he gets close, you can take advantage and attack him from the floor with Hundred Crack Kicks (it works the same that it works when you are standing).</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>

<p>The lackeys have a leader that works like Zeed except he has a counter. Apply the same method as the Zeed fight, but don’t wait for him to get up from the floor, apply the Hundred Crack Kicks as soon as possible because there is a chance he counters with his lance.</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: Spade look a like, he works the same. The difference I noted is that sometimes he will block all your kicks, but you can do another Hundred Crack Kicks if that happens. Try to fight in the front, because if you go to the back it will be harder to hit him and you might get hit.</p>

<p><strong>Bikers</strong>: This can get painful, try to always wait for them to stop after they try to ram at you; then simple kick them from the side always (otherwise you get hit); you can try to kick them while they are moving but it will likely fail most of the time. If you fall to the floor, wait for them to get close to you and use the Hundred Crack from the floor and you can eliminate like 4 of them at the same time if you get lucky</p>

<p><strong>Devil Rebirth</strong>: You must likely get your ass kicked and have Little health left, Good news this is a autoscroll fight and you don’t have to fight him; and most likely you will not get hit. Always go to the corner of the screen further away from him and wait for the attack: if he throws a tornado, dash to the other direction; if he picks a rock, wait for the rock to show up and then dash to the other direction you are facing and jump (if you do it right, you will do a summerjump that i don’t think it’s listed; and you will avoid the rock). Continue until you can actually attack him.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>

<p>The Kiba lackeys are those big guys and the small ones with swords later show up. The big ones are taking out by two Backhand Blow (don’t worry if they ram at you, it wont connect); the small ones you can also Backhand Blow them buyt sometimes it won¿t work, so I choose Hundred Crack Kicks or Drop Kick. Then a sub-boss appears, you can take him with Hundred Crack Kicks as he doesn’t seems to have any counter and the lackeys stay away from you for some reason, so beat him quickly and he will be done.
The next part, you have to choose between Ken and Rei (I choose Ken because he is the easiest to control). You will face some lackeys and then a wave of those shorts lackeys comes one after another; since there are a lot, doing the Hundred Crack Kicks is risky since it will leave you vulnerable, so I use the Drop Kick to take out this part (just be continious running and doing the Drop Kick to avoid being still in place).</p>

<p><strong>Rei</strong>: I hate those nanto bastards; try to always keep some distance because he can put a diving attack whatever he wants, never dash, always be walking close to him and attack him with Backhand Blow or Hundred Crack Kicks if you can for better effect. NEVER go close to him after he falls down because he can instantly attack you. As long as you keep half you health, it’s fine.</p>

<p><strong>King of Kiba</strong>: Well, first form he is just Zeed, so kick his ass. Then he will go into his second form, don’t bother attack him because he is invulnerable, instead keep some distance (but try to see were he is with the camera), he will dive at you, dodge him (not dashing), and using the shadow try to position yourself to do Hundred Crack Kicks (or Backhand Blow if that isn’t working) as soon as he lands on the floor. Do this like 3 or 4 times and be done.</p>

<p><strong>Jagi lackeys</strong>: Always use Backhand Blow and try to fight one at a time since if they gang up on you they probably hit you (those hammer guys hit hard, try to avoid them gang on you).</p>

<p><strong>Jagi</strong>: You fight him twice, but don’t seems to be a diference. Like with those guys, try to aproach him walking because that seems to avoid him trigerring his attacks, then do a Hundred Crack Kicks. Don’t go near him when he fall, he will shoot you, instead walk in circles around him keeping the distance and you can avoid the shot, then hit him again with Hundred Crack Kicks and repeat until you win.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>Amiba lackeys</strong>: Win the arm wrestling so you only need to face the sgort one. Take care of the henchmen with Backhand Blow and then for the short one use Diving Kick (it seems like this attack is what better connects with short people); then when he is on the ground, position yourself next to him and quickly pull a Hundred Crack Kicks (sometimes he will block this), if this doesn’t work use Diving Kick again and repeat this until he diez.</p>

<p><strong>Amiba</strong>: The second most erratic of this nanto guys, try to walk to him ,but sometimeshe attacks for no reason; deal with it and connect a Hundred Crack Kicks. After he falls, start dashing, he will either do a spinkick or start running to attack, if he run dash to avoid him until he no longer runs. Then, when he stops aproach him and do it again until he is down (if he derribes you, he has a tendency of running towards you, so use that to do a Hundred Crack Kicks from the floor to hit him). You need to have at least half your life (in worst case scenario) because you need to fight him again after that.</p>

<p><strong>Uighur</strong>: First you fight two black guys, use the usual strategy. The only worth thing is that sometimes they go together to do a double attack, stop attacking if that happens and avoid until they are done (note that you only need to get one guy in red to pull the finishing move, there is no need to beat both of them). For the boss then, is best to attack him with a Diving Kick because the whips won’t register you for some reason, after he is down, positionate yourself RIGHT to the body (not in front of the face or below his feet) and pull your Hundred Crack Kicks, repeat this until he is done. I notice that doing this positionating TENDS to avoid to trigger his counter shoulder dash, but sometimes he will counter; if that happens get away from him, do the Diving Kick and start again. After that, you only need to beat some guards, nothing new as long as you have at least half your life (in this case, try to always pull the abeshi kills to regain health and never have too little health); use some Backhand Blows and finish the chapter.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>Seekers</strong>: Use the Backhand Blows (avoid Hundred Crack Kicks) to attack this enemies, and try to only have one in front. If you see them ducking, get way because they will hit you. DONT finish this too fast to avoid having to fight the subboss in the bar (you don’t need to fight him to win this achievement). <em>if you end up fighting the boss in the bar</em> You will lose much health cause the arena is too small to fight, but if you end up here; the best thing I found is always keep distance and wait for him to attack: if he rams at you, dodge, if he walks with the Spears behing his back; position yourself facing him when he is aproching you, and pull Hundred Crack Kicks (sometimes it will work and sometimes you can get hit). In the worst case scenario you end up in the next fight with reduced health.</p>

<p><strong>Gallon</strong>: First fight as Rei, and it’s not confortable to try his aerial attack because he goes in an arch and he misses unless the enemies are large. While the enemies are large I suggest to try ussing his front attack (dash+square) since that connect always. The boss is the guy with red shirt that breath fire; attack him with front attacks and if you corner him and there isn’t lackey around you can try either Diving Attack or Hien Ryūbu. You need to have more than half your health to regain all of it (or at least 90%) because this one sucks.</p>

<p><strong>Raoh (as Toki)</strong>: Welcome to the worst part, these Roah fights are going to get you killed 9 out of 10 times. For supposly being the best, Toki moveset is horrible and practically nothing works against Raoh. His defensives moves are pathetic, so the best strategy is using thee only offensive move that seems to work. First off, always stay a mile away from him, you need space to pull it off, as Raoh moves, always move to face him front or else this will fail; now when Raoh charges, hold down front+square+X to perform a “still” Double Hand Thrust: Toki will stay still with his hand in front, and IF you are facing the front of Rao hit will connect; otherwise to the ground. So basically you need as much life as you want because this can fail often and will cause you to lose this achievement most of the time. I literally can’t find any other efficient trick other than if you fall down you can pull a Hundred Crack Kicks. <strong><em>YOU NEED TO LEARN TO PULL THIS SUCCEFULLY ENOUGH FOR THE LATER CHAPTER, OTHERWISE YOU WON’T WIN THIS.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Raoh (as Ken)</strong>: Luckily this fight has a cheap easy way out, like before, stay away from him (you don’t need to be as far from him like with Toki, just keep your distance) always facing him. As he charges at you, when he is midway to hit you, do the Hundred Crack Kicks; it will always suck him in and he will never hit you. So cheap your way out of this and continue.</p>

<p><strong>Dogs</strong>: this one is different, since most of the moves will miss since the dogs are small and below your knees. The best way, always be running to avoid the dogs attack you (never stay still), use the corners of the arena to try to group the dogs together and then use a running kick (dash+X) to hit all the dogs (most of the time). If you are doing fine you should get hit that much (stay above 80% of HP I think is fine).
This is another strange one, keep distance but not too much (enough distance to react), only attack if he is walking; between each attack I recommend to let him do his action first: he will run (move aside) or he will do some spinkick (start running across the arena). Also this boss tends to do some sort of quick attack when you try to attack, so if you get close to perform Hundred Crack Kicks and he hits you instead; press SQUARE+X and you will defend yourself (you need to do that often, otherwise you get rekt).</p>

<p><strong>Yuda (as Rei)</strong>: It’s like an easier versión of Amiba, has a automatic counter every time you tumble; so watch out for that. I still recommend to attack with front attack (dash+square), but with this one you can also try Hundred Crack Stabs for inflicting more damage and finish this quickly (since you should have like 80% HP at the worst case, and this is the last fight of the chapter).</p>

<h2 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>Shuh</strong>: He is like a nerfed version of Rei, apply the same strategy ; never try to attack before he made his move because he can suddenly start running and you need to be away from him; if he doesn’t walk to him and do a Backhand Blow or Hundred Crack Kicks. The Good nws is he doesn’t seems to defend himself that often, so 90% of the time you manage to connect an attack it will work, which is because you need full health for Souther.</p>

<p><strong>Souther army</strong>: To fight this guy always use Backhand Blow because you can leave yourself exposed if not. The first guys are flamethrowers, they are pretty slows but if you see they are starting to charge the fire, it’s better to retreat and wait until they finish firing. Next there will also be shuriken throwers, I recommend to always leave the flamethrowers for the end since they tend to stay away from the other soldiers, you should quickly dispach these guys with a Backhand Blow but if you see themflashing move upwards or downwards since they will inmidiately toss two shurikens. Since there are not much enemies, you SHOULD still have full health for Souther.</p>

<p><strong>Souther</strong>: The worst one of the Nanto, a buffed version of Amiba, so you know what to expect. First off, he will often start running towards you MORE than once, I recommend to avoid fighting him and start running to avoid him until he stops running and starts to walk. Then you are for a roussian roulette because he seems to attack randomly (if he attacks, defend yourself to reduce damage, but you still will take damage), so aproach him and hope he doesn’t attack so you can do a Backhand Blow or Hundred Crack Kicks (for better results always attemp to try this). After he is down, ALWAYS backtrack because he most likely start running again.</p>

<p><strong>Souther army</strong>: You will have some HP missing, but you should be around 70% to 80%; here try to match the abeshi to heal yourself, since there are a lot of these. You meet a new one: an arrow soldier, this is the new you need to first kill; don’t waste your time trying to aproach him, do a Diving Kick to kill him as soon as posible because he will continuously spam arrows. So the expected order is: arrow soldier =&gt; shuriken thrower =&gt; flamethrower. You can lose up to half your health in the worst case scenario, but you need to regain like at least like 70% of HP for not having problems with Souther.</p>

<p><strong>Rematch with Souther</strong>: I don’t seem to notice any diferrence except he will act more aggressive and run a lot more before he stop. You need to avoid his attacks enough times since they make you fight him twice in this form. The most likely scenario is your HP to stay between something like 30% and 70% during both fights.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>Raoh (as Toki)</strong>: Welcome to hell, this game has no better idea than throwing this again, I hope you master this technique back in Chapter 5 because you need to do this again. TWICE. Be careful, since the arena is circular, Raoh tends to go clockwise and then switch direction, if he switch direction, to posionate yourself it’s better to rotate yourself; but if he start running while you are doing this you need to avoid with dash otherwise you get massive (LIKE A LOT) of damage.; also try to pull this move always left or right, it’s super hard to pull this diagonally or upwards or downwards (since it’s difficult to judge Depth). Survive this hellhole, if your health goes below 40% it’s okay. The good news is there is little to stop you now except for the next fight.</p>

<p><strong>Lance brigade</strong>: Such piece of garbage right at the very end, not gonna lie there is a chance you die here (yes, obviously my case) and you will barely survive with like 10% to 20% of HP. There are thoseguys with lances that deal massive damage, use Backhand Blows and defend if they block you, you can’t give an Edge to getting damage from these guys. And then they throw bikers, obviously you have to be continuously running to not get hit by those lance guys while trying to positionate the camera to deal with those bikers with running kicks (like before). Never bother to attack those lance guys until there isn’t any biker on screen. This is pretty much RNG luck factor, so good luck.</p>

<p><strong>Hiruka</strong>: Last boss, this guy has some sort of tendency to defend like Shin. Don’t bother killing his guars, just focus on him, he has a lokng range weapon (don’t know what that is) which means you have to attack from afar with Diving Kick, besides you don’t want to die at this point and that last fight must have left you with like 50% of HP, so you don’t have room for error. Pull Diving Kick, if he defends, dash to the side to avoid his weapon (seriously, it makes a lot of damage and you don’t have much HP). If you beat him, congrats you won.</p>

<p><strong>Raoh</strong>: Nothing new, pull the same cheap trick you did before. You fight twice, and this basically is an excuse fight to regain health.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>Raoh</strong>: It’s over, he is the same. I think the only difference is that he SOMETIMES will block your Hundred Crack Kicks. But that doesn’t matter, you have your health refuel at the beggining of the chapter and it’s literally impossible that he will hit you enough times to kill you (unless you have even worst luck than mine, sorry if that’s the case). Beat him twice and be done already.</p>

<p>Congrats for gaining this achievement that conbines RNG luck with cheap strategy and manage to always try to pull abeshi kills to regain health. And this will also be the entire tip list for every achievement of the set of beating each chapter without using continues.</p>
