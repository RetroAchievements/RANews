<p>Vaati, the rogue Minish, has plagued the land of Hyrule while seeking out the Light Force. Eventually, Vaati will have enough and launch a three phase battle against you, and the challenge is to not get hit during any of them.</p>

<p>I wish to credit <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/BlaineSensei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlaineSensei</a> and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Ness64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ness64</a> for documenting initial strategies, along with the Minish Cap Randomizer community for some silly things they discovered as well.</p>

<p><strong>To clear things up</strong>: when you first open the boss door, the challenge has not started yet. You can take all the damage you want up to and including the three Darknuts. Once you get past the Darknuts, the challenge properly begins.</p>

<p><strong>Vaati Reborn</strong>: Equip the sword and gust jar. I found it best to be on the side of Vaati, up above worse case. Vaati will summon four eyeballs and rotate them around Patra style. Use your sword to take out the eyes, and Vaati will start to writhe in pain. Use the sword at this point, though keep in mind he may teleport out of the way a few times. After two phases of this, the eyes will be covered in some sort of cloak. The gust jar can be used to remove the cloak. This can even be done while Vaati summons the eyes, allowing for a minor time save.</p>

<p>Vaati will attack via teleporting, shooting eye lasers down, and summoning fire. Vaati likes to teleport to five specific spots according to Ness64, so learn those spots. The eye lasers is why you never want to be below Vaati for long. As for the fire: it may be possible to attack the flames, but it’s recommended to dodge the fire attack.</p>

<p><strong>Vaati Transfigured</strong>: Equip the sword and bow. There are 8 eyes surrounding the core, and four of them are vulnerable. The good news is that the vulnerable eyes are all connected, with no broken chains. The bad news is that you must find them by shooting the eyes with arrows. Once you reveal all four, use the glowing spots to clone yourself and then attack the eyes at once. This will make the core vulnerable. You can either mash the attack button, or if you want to try a more subtle strategy, charge a spin attack while still split into four and then unleash it, followed up by some extra attacks.</p>

<p>There are four possible patterns for the eyes to be in, and every time you complete a cycle it changes to a different one.</p>

<p>The debris must be cleared out with the sword or bow. Do what you can to dodge the falling junk: this is the most random part of this battle. If you see electricity attacks coming towards you or one of your clones, immediately dismiss them: any clone that gets attacked by electricity will affect you.</p>

<p><strong>Vaati Wrath</strong>: Start with the cane equipped: the pegasus boots are optional. Wait for Vaati to burrow and then re-summon one of his arms, and then flip it around with the cane. Shrink into minish form and enter. At this point, use your sword and attack the eye that looks different from the others. Repeat this for the other arm. You will likely want the lantern for the second arm since it is darker in there, but it is not required if you feel lucky. It should be noted that you are immune to damage from most things while waiting on the minish pedestal, but it is best to at least get Vaati out of the way from there first before trying that.</p>

<p>When the arms are destroyed, Vaati will start to move from side to side. If he unleashes a barrage of electric balls, get out of the way. Remember to de-clone yourself just in case. The other attack is to charge four energy balls from the smaller eyes. Clone yourself and reflect them back with a well timed slash. If you are lucky, all four will be stunned at the same time, allowing you to attack the vulnerable Vaati. Use whatever you feel like: multiple sword swipes, a full clone spin attack, even throwing and detonating remote bombs if you wish. There are times when only three eyes get damaged: either Vaati likes to cheat or you were slightly out of position (it’s the former). Three rounds of this should do it. There will be times when Vaati will unleash an electricity attack followed by the reflection. It may be better to abandon the attack during that phase and just move out of the way. Patience is key to winning this one without taking damage.</p>

<p>Complete this challenge and Vaati will terrorize the land no more.</p>
