<h1 id="2-introduction">2) Introduction</h1>

<p>Pok√©mon Crystal Version is the third and final Generation II core series game for Game Boy Color. It was released as a solitary version to Pok√©mon Gold and Silver, which were released one year before. It was released in Japan on December 14, 2000, in North America on July 29, 2001, and in Europe on November 2, 2001.</p>

<p>It featured various fixes and some new additions, most notably the introduction of the option to play as a girl. It takes place in the region of Johto like Gold and Silver, with access to Kanto granted later in the game, with the player‚Äôs starting town being New Bark Town.</p>

<p>This set features 113 achievements by dude1286 with a great revision by msdmario. You cannot get a much more complete set than this one for Pok√©mon Crystal, with it not only covering progression and challenges for the progression, but also a ton of miscellaneous stuff involving the time of day or the day of the week, as well as the exchanging of phone numbers with NPCs and much, much more. You‚Äôll be busy for a while with this set, but you will be done with a satisfying feeling that you have truly done everything the game has to offer‚Ä¶ well, besides a truly complete Pok√©dex obviously.</p>

<h1 id="3-walkthrough">3) Walkthrough</h1>

<p><a href="#step-1-story-achievements--total-points-320"><strong>Step 1: Story Achievements</strong></a></p>

<p>All of these achievements are gained by just going through the story, though do mind you: I did exclude the gym challenges with the story achievements as well to keep the guide clean. So in reality, there are 16 missable achievements here. Every single one of these achievements will have tips and tricks on how to do it effectively however, so it‚Äôs worth a check in case you are curious on how to approach these with the level caps and item restrictions.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="#step-2-missable-achievements--total-points-171"><strong>Step 2: Missable Achievements</strong></a></p>

<p>All of the missable achievements. In reality, most of these boil down to‚Ä¶ just don‚Äôt kill the static one-encounter Pok√©mon, catch them. It‚Äôs a Pok√©mon game, so this much should be obvious. The static Pok√©mon include Sudowoodo and Snorlax, as well as every legendary Pok√©mon.</p>

<p>The actual missables of this section are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199568">Notice Me Suicune-pai!</a> - Must be done while in Cianwood City for the first time, involves fighting an optional trainer battle.</li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199594">Fateful Encounter I</a> - Must be done preferably before Gym 7, or as quickly as possible after the previous achievement. Involves finding Suicune on the route to Mahogany Town, where the 7th gym battle is.</li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199595">Fateful Encounter II</a> - Must be done preferably before Gym 8, or as quickly as possible after the previous achievement. Involves finding Suicune on the route next to the Bug Catching Contest.</li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199571">Rocket Hideout Conqueror</a> - Must be done before finishing the Rocket Hideout, as you need to fight every trainer inside.</li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199572">Rocket Takeover Twarted</a> - Must be done before finishing the Radio Tower event, as you need to fight every trainer inside.</li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199576">Aced the Test</a> - Must be done right after Gym 8, that just involves answering all questions correct in the Dragon‚Äôs Den Shrine.</li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/199630">Shuckie Approves</a> - Can be done at any time. Just avoid giving Shuckie back to his original owner without having gotten it to max friendship.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><a href="#step-3-datetimephone-achievements--total-points-78"><strong>Step 3: Datetime/Phone Achievements</strong></a></p>

<p>All of these achievements have to be done on a specific date, or time. The date and time can be changed, albeit through a hidden way which I will be telling you about in section 4 of this guide. Likewise, ‚ÄúPhone‚Äù achievements are also included with this step, which involves refighting trainers through phone calls or receiving items from them. There is also a trick for these, which I will also be telling you about in section 4.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="#step-4-miscellaneous-achievements--total-points-262"><strong>Step 4: Miscellaneous Achievements</strong></a></p>

<p>These are all of the remaining achievements that can be done at any point in the game, and will not involve missables. Most of these are pretty straightforward, but some benefit from having some good tips that will make them a lot easier for you!</p>

<h1 id="4-very-useful-tips-and-tricks">4) Very useful tips and tricks</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Try to avoid using TMs for as long as possible, or at least one that you might want to use for the Battle Tower near the end of the game. Popular TMs such as Earthquake and Toxic can only be gotten once, and never again, and might make a massive difference in the Battle Tower depending on your team.</li>
  <li>I recommend having a party of 5 or 6 <strong>Johto</strong> Pok√©mon at all times. The main reason for this is so that you can spread out the levels over multiple Pok√©mon without fearing that you end up touching the level cap. Alternatively, you can just keep Johto Pok√©mon underlevelled while overlevelling Kanto Pok√©mon and just use them for the Gym battles instead.</li>
  <li>Most gyms in the Kanto region have a level cap beyond 40, with the exception of Janine‚Äôs gym. Given that the Legendary Dogs are all at level 40, it might be worth considering catching these before tackling Kanto so you have three great Pok√©mon that can tackle every gym. Other than those, I often recommend to catch high-levelled Pok√©mon for these gyms if you don‚Äôt want to deal with the roamers, such as Skarmory and Lantern. Of course, if your main team remains below the level cap anyway, just use them.</li>
  <li>Changing the date and time is a bit more cryptic than necessary. You can switch between emulators if you are comfortable doing that (Sameboy/mGBA both handle datetime differently), or you can use the reset function generator found on <a href="http://www.psypokes.com/gsc/timechange.php">this site</a>. Ignore that it says Crystal is disabled because it definitely works. Press Down, Select, and B simultaneously on the title screen which will bring you to a prompt to input a password. This is based on your name, your ID, and the amount of money you have. The password will not change as long as you don‚Äôt get money, so you can easily save, reset, input password in cases such as getting Buena‚Äôs number.</li>
  <li>You can manipulate NPCs into calling you by going to New Bark Town, talking to your mother and changing the daylight savings. Constantly alternating between winter/summer time will instantly prompt an NPC to call you. This will be very useful for getting Elemental Stones, as they cannot be bought and you need a few for Pok√©dex completion.</li>

<p>As long as you chose either Cyndaquil or Totodile as starter Pok√©mon, this gym likely won‚Äôt give you trouble. However, I do highly recommend getting a Dunsparce from the Dark Cave right before Violet City. It is normal type so won‚Äôt take high damage, and it having access to the move Rage (which will do more damage every time it gets hit) will make it shred through Pok√©mon. Other Pok√©mon before this point won‚Äôt really help you too much but if your starter/Dunsparce somehow don‚Äôt do the job, they‚Äôre nice to have.</p>

<p>If you chose Cyndaquil as starter: congratulations, you won! If not, remember the Dunsparce from earlier? It will still shred through this gym battle without any issues. If not, getting a Hoothoot and/or Wooper will never hurt either, even if only getting them for later gym encounters and to spread out levels to avoid hitting the level cap.</p>

<p>Going to sound like a broken record but I cannot recommend it enough, use Dunsparce. Send it in as your first Pok√©mon, have it get attacked and use rage and there you go. Even the unstoppable Miltank will fall before the god also known as Dunsparce. Aside from that, you can get a Heracross in Azalea Town after having gotten the Headbutt TM which is never a bad option.</p>

<p>Dunsparce has unfortunately outlived its usefulness at this point, so we need to get a bit more creative. Unless you have picked Totodile as starter and have access to bite/crunch, there aren‚Äôt many other Pok√©mon that have a super effective move against ghost Pok√©mon at this point. Depending on if you want to go through the effort (although I can highly recommend it for other gyms too), you can evolve Zubat into Golbat at level 22 and then increase its happiness so much it becomes a Crobat before level 25. Aside from that, use any of the Pok√©mon I‚Äôve mentioned before as well as Sudowoodo, who you have (most likely) caught before this gym. If you‚Äôre really struggling, you can choose to move beyond Ecruteak City and catch a few Pok√©mon, but Morty‚Äôs Pok√©mon have a high chance to use Curse to halve their hitpoints so you‚Äôll probably be fine anyway.</p>

<p>Chuck most likely won‚Äôt give you too much trouble given that there are more options to you available now. A personal favourite of mine is the Chinchou evolution line which has good coverage for this gym and the next one, but there‚Äôs also Togetic, Mantine, and the before-mentioned Crobat. A flying move or a few will easily carry you through this gym and if not, there are always the previous Pok√©mon you used that could be at a good level.</p>

<p>As Jasmine follows right after Chuck, your pool of Pok√©mon has not increased by much. The level cap for this gym is higher, but do be wary as the gym that follows after has a lower level cap of 31, so don‚Äôt grind Pok√©mon you are planning to use there. What you can alternatively do is go for gym 7 first as this one is not needed for there, but it won‚Äôt really give you any advantages for this gym. If you chose either Cyndaquil or Totodile as starter you will probably be fine anyway; just add any of the before-mentioned Pok√©mon like Lanturn, Sudowoodo, or Heracross, with the latter two having access to fighting moves which is always welcome. Wooper/Quagsire especially are good options due to being part Ground and therefore not taking damage from the Magnetons, as well as having access to Earthquake.</p>

<p>Yet again, the pool of Pok√©mon hasn‚Äôt increased much since the last gym, so your options are fairly similar. If you did keep around Dunsparce despite not having use during the last two gyms then hey, he can be useful here again! The Cyndaquil line will obviously shred this gym, and the advantage of Piloswine being part ground is that most previously-mentioned Water Pok√©mon (Quagsire especially) will also not have any problem.</p>

<p>Clair has one glaring weakness, and it just so happens to be the cave right before Blackthorne City. This cave has an amazing Pok√©mon by the name of Swinub, who is part Ice and therefore Clair‚Äôs worst nightmare. This is a Pok√©mon I can generally recommend for the entire game afterwards so be sure to go for it. Heck, go for two, the sky is the limit. Joking aside, the route south of Blackthorne also has another great unit in Skarmory which, while not super effective, won‚Äôt take a lot of damage from the dragon Pok√©mon so great option. Crobat is great, Lanturn is a personal favourite, Sudowoodo and Dunsparce kinda fell off but can still be useful, and there‚Äôs always your starter of course.</p>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can do this achievement at any time and therefore have many more options available to you, but for consistency sake, let‚Äôs assume you have to do it on your first try given that you already have a well-built team. Well, I did say before that Swinub and Skarmory are both excellent Pok√©mon for Clair, and that remains true for the Elite Four too‚Äìespecially Lance. You will most likely have caught Suicune as well which is great for the Elite four, and possibly Entei/Raikou too. Finally, I can‚Äôt stress this enough but Crobat is a really good Pok√©mon in generation two. These 6 Pok√©mon are all excellent, but if you don‚Äôt want to hunt for the legendary dogs or decide not to use some of these, your starter, Lanturn, and Quagsire are all still good choices. And remember, you are allowed to use items outside of battle so take this to your advantage.</p>

<p>Lt. Surge is the first gym you‚Äôll see when arriving in Kanto, and due to the level cap being higher than than of the League, just use the team you used there‚Äìespecially Piloswine. Due to the low difficulty, it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll face any trouble here.</p>

<p>While most other gyms can be done in any order, I‚Äôm just going to write this guide with the most likely order, meaning that Sabrina is next. Yet again, due to the city being north of Vermillion City, you will most likely be under the level cap and have no issue going at it with your current team. If you are over-levelled, you can go for a Houndour right next to Saffron City and train it since you want to go for dex completion probably anyway, or just catching a Skarmory or two south of Blackthorne. The Legendary Dogs are also an option given that you haven‚Äôt been using them in your team yet, and getting a Pok√©mon to max friendship and then using the move Return will also pretty much guarantee you the victory.</p>

<p>Erika has a lower level cap and you unfortunately might be higher than it depending on what route you are taking or how you‚Äôve training your Pok√©mon. The advice from Sabrina applies though; just catch a Skarmory or use the Legendary Dogs if you haven‚Äôt used them yet, or a Pok√©mon with high friendship with the move Return.</p>

<p>An annoying gym because the level cap is below anything you have faced since Claire. Doesn‚Äôt really mean it‚Äôs difficult of course, but it does eliminate the usage of Legendary Dogs if you‚Äôve been saving them got the gym battles. So instead, I‚Äôll give you the classic advice of catching Skarmories, Swinubs, and Houndours and training them. It‚Äôs not really a difficult gym battle otherwise really.</p>

<p>Similarly to the previous gym battles, you might be over the level cap. If you are, the previous advice of using the Legendary Dogs/catching a Skarmory still applies, with the addendum that you can catch a level 40 Lanturn with a Super Rod which will also destroy Misty.</p>

<p>Likewise to Janine, Brock is later in the region so the main team you are using is very likely to be overlevelled. And also likewise, catch a few Lanturns with a Super Rod or Skarmories again and there‚Äôs your win. Of course, if you did not use Suicune yet, it‚Äôs the perfect Pok√©mon for this gym and a high recommendation.</p>

<p>Blaine might be at a point where you are still below the level cap, in which case you can just use the team you‚Äôve been using to go through the game with. If not, your next best options are the Legendary Dogs (Suicune primarily) or catching level 40 Lanturns with the Super Rod. Surf away!</p>

<p>I would be very surprised if you are levelled higher than Blue. Level 58 is quite a high cap so using your main team is certainly the way to go. A diverse team in general is recommended, as Blue does not follow a singular type and instead has a team mirroring his generation 1 team, minus the starter. Therefore, you should absolutely come prepared for multiple types. If you have been listening to my advice earlier (I hope you have), you have a team consisting of at least Piloswine, Skarmory, and Crobat, with the other three Pok√©mon being up to your own preference, like the Legendary Dogs or Quagsire/Lanturn/your starter. If you have been managing this team well and training them a bit, you will have a counter for all of Blue‚Äôs Pok√©mon. If you are still struggling, consider a Houndour or a Blissey with maximum friendship and and move Return.</p>

<p>Red fortunately is able to be battled again after every league clear, so if your current team does not fit the bill, you‚Äôre able to do it later with a specialized team. Like Blue, Red has a  diverse team of pretty high-leveled Pok√©mon so it is recommended to use the team you have been going through the game with. Like my recommendations earlier, Piloswine, Skarmory, Crobat, and the three Legendary Dogs or your starter are all excellent choices. If those don‚Äôt do the job, train a Houndour and/or a Blissey with maximum friendship and the move Return.</p>

<p>Not marked as missable, but you can technically miss this is you give back Shuckie too early while its happiness is not high enough. You can get Shuckie in Cianwood City, and to trigger this achievement, you need to increase its happiness to the max. You can check this in Goldenrod City in the far-east house. Once you are confident, go back to Cianwood City, save just in case, and talk to the guy who gave you Shuckie with the Pok√©mon in your party. He will tell you you can keep it due to the high happiness.</p>

<p>-=MISSABLE=-</p>

<p>The most annoying Pok√©mon to catch. You need to hunt them down across Johto, and find them at least once for them to be in the Pok√©dex so you can actually see where it is‚Ä¶ not that it will really help much since they move screens every time you move one. To make matters worse, they flee on the first turn, and also have access to the move Roar. The latter is unavoidable, but there is at least a consistent strategy to getting an encounter with them:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Catch a Haunter or, more ideally, a Jynx, which I will also base this guide on. Its speed when caught must be 44 at level 20, 45 at level 21, or 47 at level 22. Once you got one that matches those stats, give it 10 Carbos and raise it to exactly level 40. Give them both the moves Mean Look and Hypnosis/Sweet Kiss depending on which of the two you chose.</li>
  <li>Buy a lot of Max Repels and Ultra Balls, and make sure that Jynx/Haunter is your highest-levelled Pok√©mon in the party. That way you can use a repel and still encounter Entei/Raikou while avoiding other encounters.</li>
  <li>Go to a random route where you can easily switch screens, preferably one where you need to travel through a gate. For example, west of Ecruteak City. Just keep going through this gate and go into the grass for a few seconds, if there is no encounter then go through the gate to the city, back to the route, rinse and repeat. Once you‚Äôve got them registered, you can also check the Pok√©dex to see if they are on that route or not.</li>
  <li>Once in battle, put them asleep first, then use Mean Look, do some damage (for example, Dream Eater is a consistent damaging move) so they are in the red zone of their health bar and keep chucking Ultra Balls. You very likely won‚Äôt get them on your first try, so just keep repeating the steps again until you are finally lucky. At the very least, their hitpoints will remain low on the next encounter so you only need to put them so sleep and use Mean Look again.</li>
</ol>

<p>After having received the Silver Wing from a man in Pewter City, head back to the Whirlpool Islands east of Cianwood City. Venture down and at the very bottom, you‚Äôll find a level 60 Lugia. Both Lugia and Ho-oh have the unfortunate downside of having Recover as move, so it‚Äôs recommended to bring a Pok√©mon that can put them asleep to prevent them from spamming it while you lower their HP. Once their HP is low, just chuck Ultra Balls again as usual.</p>

<p>This achievement is only missable if you do not capture all three of the Legendary Dogs. If you don‚Äôt, you will not be able to enter the Tin Tower where Ho-oh is, which also has items. I‚Äôm not going to tell you every location as I have a nice map below (courtesy of ZaidusRecon on Reddit) and also a link to <a href="https://www.smogon.com/ingame/guides/gsc_items">Smogon</a>, but there are a few sneaky ones you may want to watch out for, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taking the boat from Kanto to Johto (this counts as Johto items)
    <ul>
      <li>After leaving this boat, use surf and go left to find an item within the harbour. Needs to be done after leaving the boat, otherwise you can‚Äôt get back in.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are a few items in the Goldenrod Department Store Basement, where boxes are moved around every time you re-enter from the elevator.</li>
  <li>The map is wrong with displaying the location for the Revive in Cianwood City. It‚Äôs in the rock beneath the house.</li>
  <li>The Ruins of Alph has secret doors in every puzzle room that will lead to more items.</li>
  <li>Mt. Silver falls within Johto, so be sure to get the (hidden) items here as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides that, the only advice I can really give is to mark off every location. The achievement is 209 items in total, and it would be redundant to post every single location here in text.</p>

<p>This is missable for obvious reasons: don‚Äôt kill static Pok√©mons and Legendaries. If you don‚Äôt catch them during your first and only encounter, you can‚Äôt get this achievement. This involves every Pok√©mon that has an achievement (Sudowoodo, Snorlax), and the Legendary Pok√©mon. Obviously don‚Äôt delete the egg you get from Professor Elm for the Togepi.</p>

<p>Other tips and tricks to make this achievement managable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When in need of elemental stones (see: No Longer Scarce achievement), have only their numbers in the phone and no one elses. Then, go to your house, ask mom to switch between summer/winter time, and you will get consistent calls. They‚Äôll either challenge you for a battle or to give you an item, which will be the elemental stones.</li>
  <li>Get the Exp Share by trading in the Red Scale (see: Rare Hunter). For Pok√©mon that need levels, just go to the League and fast-forward through battles with your strongest Pok√©mon(s) while another Pok√©mon holding the Exp Share is in the backrow.</li>
  <li>For getting Pok√©mon their happiness up, I found the main road of Goldenrod City to the route below to be pretty long. Put the Pok√©mon in first slot, hop on your cycle, and fastforward for a while. There is a happiness checker in the same City.</li>

<p>Either get a Pok√©mon‚Äôs friendship to the absolute lowest (have it faint in battle multiple times back to back, store it in PC) or to the highest (keep it in your party while walking, win battles with it), then go to Goldenrod City and in the far-east house, the NPC will tell you the values. Then, go to the Goldenrod City Department Story on Sunday, and the NPC on the fifth floor will give you a move based on the friendship. Use this move in battle to gain the achievement.</p>

<p>As the description implies, you need to catch every letter of the alphabet here. The Pok√©dex has an additional tab for Unown to check which ones you already have. More Unown letters spawn after each puzzle is solved within the ruins, so you can use that to your advantage to either limit the ones you want to see or just have them all unlocked at once. A-K is available after the Kabuto Puzzle, L-R after Omanyte, S-W after Aerodactyl, and X-Z after Ho-oh.</p>

<p>Hidden Power is the default move of Unown.

The chance of hitting a super effective is pretty high though so this shouldn‚Äôt take too long.</p>

<p>Farfetch‚Äôd can be found on Route 43 during morning/day, north of Mahogany Town. It has a 20% appearance rate, and a 2% chance to hold a Stick. If you play on emulators that support it, there will be a trigger in the bottom-right of the screen letting you know when the Farfetch‚Äôd you are facing has a Stick, so then either capture it or use the move Thief.</p>

<p>Cubone/Marowak can be found in the Rock Tunnel during morning/day. Cubone has a 30% appearance rate while Marowak has a 5% appearance rate. Both have a 2% chance to hold a Thick Club. If you play on emulators that support it, there will be a trigger in the bottom-right of the screen letting you know when the Cubone/Marowak you are facing has a Thick Club, so then either capture it or use the move Thief.</p>

      <td>Steal or catch a wild Chansey holding a Lucky Egg.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Chansey can found on Route 13, 14, and 15 at any point of the day. Unfortunately, Chansey has a very low appearance rate of 1%, with it then only having a 2% chance to hold the Lucky Egg. You can slightly increase the odds hunting it during day on Route 14 with your highest Pok√©mon being level 28, meaning that only it, Pidgeotto, Venemoth, Hoppip, and Skiploom can appear alongside it. Regardless, it has the potential to be a very long grind and I don‚Äôt really have much more advice beyond just keep trying. If you play on emulators that support it, there will be a trigger in the bottom-right of the screen letting you know when the Chansey you are facing has a Lucky Egg, so then either capture it or use the move Thief. Might as well chuck your Master Ball at it tbh.</p>

<p>As the description applies, you need to get every TM that cannot be repeatedly bought with money or coins from the game corner. You can still use these during your playthrough and don‚Äôt need to have them all at once. Aside from gym battle rewards and HMs, you need to get the following TMs:</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not going to tell you every location as I have a nice map below (courtesy of ZaidusRecon on Reddit) and also a link to <a href="https://www.smogon.com/ingame/guides/gsc_items">Smogon</a>, but there are a few sneaky ones you may want to watch out for, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taking the boat from Johto to Kanto (this counts as Johto items)
    <ul>
      <li>After leaving this boat, use surf and go left to find a hitten item in the water within the harbour. Needs to be done after leaving the boat, otherwise you can‚Äôt get back in.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt forget the underground path leading from Cerulean City to Vermillion City</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides that, the only advice I can really give is to mark off every location. The achievement is ??? (sorry beent too long since I played lmao) items in total, and it would be redundant to post every single location here in text.</p>

<p>Yet again a massive list that would be to redundant to post, so I will share the ones most obviously forgotten about instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guards will only fight you at night, and are located on Route 34, 35, and 39</li>
  <li>Also on Route 34, surf to the south-west for a secluded area with 3 Cooltrainers</li>
  <li>There are a bunch of trainers around the Lake of Rage, including fishermen</li>
  <li>Mt. Mortar is an optional area you might have forgotten about, and has several trainers inside</li>
  <li>Route 45/46 also has a bunch of trainers on different paths</li>
  <li>If all else fails, checking around the Whirl Islands would be a safe bet thanks to the big open area it is</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet again a massive list that would be to redundant to post, so I will share the ones most obviously forgotten about instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don‚Äôt forget that the route east of New Bark Town is part of Kanto</li>
  <li>There‚Äôs a good amount of trainers in the water around Cinnabar Island</li>
</ul>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>You can choose any Pok√©mon you wish, and given that the Elite Four/Champion never becomes stronger than their first try, a lot of people will be viable for this. Personally, I can recommend Piloswine due to the moves it has being effective or at the very least neutral against all Pok√©mon. Dragonite, Tyranitar, Crobat, and the Legendaries are all good options as well. Remember that you can only bring a single Pok√©mon, but there is no restrictions on item usage during or between battles. If you somehow get in trouble, using X items and Guard Spec will make this even easier. Making the Pok√©mon hold Leftovers (Celadon City restaurant) will not hurt either.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can choose any Pok√©mon you wish, and yet again I can recommend Piloswine a lot. Due to Red starting with a Pikachu and there being no restriction on item usage, it‚Äôs very easy to just use a bunch of X items near the start of the battle that will practically ensure that you will defeat every Pok√©mon in one hit. Earthquake OP. Dragonite, Tyranitar, Crobat, and the Legendaries are all good options as well, and a max friendship Blissey with Softboiled and Return will also make this battle easy. Making the Pok√©mon hold Leftovers (Celadon City restaurant) will not hurt either.</p>

<p>The toughest achievements of the set, but still ones that you can do fairly easy with a prepared team of a few Pok√©mon. You can bring up to 3 Pok√©mon, and to save yourself some grinding, it‚Äôs best to breed all of them, get their frienship up to the max quickly after they hatched, and then level them to 10 with all vitamins used on them. The following Pok√©mon are high recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blissey - The most commonly-used Pok√©mon due to its high hitpool and being neutral against most types. Give it Leftovers as held item, and at least Return and Softboiled as moves. Double Team, Toxic, Fire Blast, Blizzard/Ice Beam, and Thunder/Thunderbolt are good other moves depending on if you have the TMs</li>
  <li>Skarmory - Doesn‚Äôt have a lot of weaknesses and can dish out a lot of damage. Personally, I used Skarmory with a Focus Sash as held item, and a Rest/Sleeptalk build with Toxic and Steel Wing as supporting moves</li>
  <li>Houndour - For me just the third extra Pok√©mon if the other two failed, but still a great choice. I gave it a Quick Claw as held item, with Return, Flamethrower, Shadow Ball, and Sludge Bomb as moves</li>
  <li>Smeargle - Not one I used myself, but Smeargle is a very popular choice as well. Equip it with a Focus Sash or Gold Berry as item and give it Dragon Rage and it will do the job</li>
  <li>Wobbuffet - Give it a focus sash and use counter and congrats, you won</li>
  <li>Heracross - No experience using Heracross myself, but it‚Äôs a potentially good sweeper so might be worth considering if the others don‚Äôt sound appealing. Give it a Quick Claw and the moves Earthquake, Protect, and Return with max friendship and you go another good candidate.</li>
</ul>

<p>I should stress that I am not a competitive player at all, but with Blissey/Skarmory/Houndour it only took me a few tries. Porygon-2 with its Hyper Beam was probably the biggest threat for me.</p>
