<p>Hello there, I’m <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Nepiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nepiki</a>! I’m a gamer who has an unofficial case of amnesia so I have an obsession with writing everything down so I don’t forget about it! Joking aside, I do genuinely like writing, especially if it helps out other people. I don’t have a lot of guides yet, but expect to see more pop up in the future!</p>

<p>For everything me related, here are some links you can check out:</p>

<h1 id="2-introduction">2) Introduction</h1>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third game in The Legend of Zelda series and was released in 1991 in Japan and 1992 in North America and Europe.</p>

<p>A Link to the Past focuses on Link as he journeys to save Hyrule, defeat the dark lord Ganon, and rescue the descendants of the Seven Sages. It returns to a top-down perspective similar to the original The Legend of Zelda, dropping the side-scrolling gameplay of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It introduced series staples such as parallel worlds and items including the Master Sword.</p>

<p>A Link to the Past has a total of 55 Achievements worth 435 points. The achievement set has been created by Retro Achievement developers <a href="https://retroachievements.org/User/dude1286">dude1286</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/User/HenrySwanson">HenrySwanson</a> and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/User/AntTanGames">AntTanGames</a>. The set of achievements are mostly designed to be achievable by the casual player, with the no-damage achievements for the more hardcore players. The game also has multiple leaderboards, including minigames and no-hit runs.</p>

<h1 id="3-walkthrough">3) Walkthrough</h1>

<p><a href="#step-1-story-achievements--total-points-137"><strong>Step 1: Story Achievements</strong></a></p>

<p>All of the story achievements are not missable, and will come to you over time when beating the game. The guide has sorted them on the chronological order of getting them in-game.</p>

<p><a href="#step-2-item-upgrade-achievements-1-missable--total-points-163"><strong>Step 2: Item (upgrade) achievements (1 missable)</strong></a></p>

<p>Some items not found in dungeons are optional, and can be done after some specific progress has been made. The only missable achievement happens when you don’t upgrade the shield through the waterfall, but by buying it in the dark world. The guide has sorted the achievements on the chronological order of getting them in-game.</p>

<p><a href="#step-3-no-damage-achievements-11-missable--total-points-135"><strong>Step 3: No-damage achievements (11 missable)</strong></a></p>

<p>These achievements are all missed when beating the boss while taking damage. This may sound intimidating, but there are some ways to cheese bosses. Some do still require legitimate strategies and skill, but they can be made easier by doing a few optional sidequests.</p>

<h1 id="4-tips-and-tricks-no-spoilers">4) Tips and tricks (no spoilers)</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Remember that the game has a built-in copy feature for save files, for a maximum of 3 slots. This can be especially useful if you want to keep a boss for later due to it being too tough, or if you want to do dungeons in a specific order as you can (kinda) do the Dark World dungeons in a different order than stated.</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>One such example is by getting the item from the dungeon, but not beating the boss yet. This way, you can keep the boss from the first dungeon in the Dark World alive and kill him last for example.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>By visiting the ice cave in the lower-right part of the Light World and charging into the fairy statue in the middle, a bee will fly out. This bee is special as it stays alive for longer, and will attack enemies for you when you store it in a bottle. This also works on bosses, and can in some situations be very effective.</li>
  <li>After beating the second dungeon in the Dark World, I recommend getting the item from the fourth dungeon in Thieves Town first. That way, you can lift up heavier stones and get a lot of items that will make no-damage bosses easier. For example, you can get your sword tempered and obtain the Magic Cape from the cemetery, which makes you invincible at the cost of magic points. For the latter, also be sure to half your magic meter A.S.A.P. near the smithies because this will be essential for no-damage runs.</li>
  <li>When taking damage from a boss, your best option is to use the magic mirror to teleport back to the entrance. Resetting the game will place you at a specific spot on the map, so you’d have to walk all the way back to the dungeon.</li>
  <li><strong>ALWAYS ENTER A BOSS ROOM WITH FULL HEALTH IF YOU ARE ATTEMPTING THE NO-DAMAGE ACHIEVEMENTS.</strong> I am not 100% sure this is required to get the achievement, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.</li>
</ul>

<em>Defeat all the Armos Knights without being harmed.</em></p>

<p>-=MISSABLE=-</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations: None. They can be harmed with a sword, but the arrows are definitely the better option here.</strong></p>

<p>The Armos Knights most likely won’t give you too much trouble. Just stay in one corner (I prefer south-east) and keep shooting arrows till only one Armos Knight remains. Every Armos Knight dies within 3 arrows, so use that to your advantage. The final Armos Knight will jump around and try to hit you from above, but this shouldn’t be too much trouble if you keep walking around away from his landing position.</p>

<em>Defeat all three Lanmolas without being harmed.</em></p>

<p>-=MISSABLE=-</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations: Ice Rod.</strong></p>

<p>Surprisingly one of the tougher bosses to no-damage since there isn’t really an easy strategy, and I unfortunately don’t have a lot of advice to give here either. The Ice Rod is a recommendation, but it won’t necessarily save you–it will just do a bit more damage than your sword. The best advice I can give is to wait for the final Lanmolas to pop out and try to hit that one. The rocks they shoot out always go diagonally so take your time and be extra careful. Do keep in kind however, that the final undefeated Lanmolas will shoot out in eight directions. I definitely recommend keeping the Ice Rod for the final one to get rid of it easier. Patience really is key here, and should be your main priority.</p>

<em>Defeat Moldorm without being harmed.</em></p>

<p>-=MISSABLE=-</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations: None</strong></p>

<p>I unfortunately don’t have much advice for Moldorm. The good thing about him is that he can’t hurt you as long as you are charging your sword. The problem here isn’t taking damage however, but falling down. Fortunately, falling down also means an easy reset, so you can try this boss over and over again. He definitely is an annoying boss, but he shouldn’t really hurt you, so the achievement should be pretty easy to unlock. If the boss still gives you trouble, you can try pause buffering him by constantly opening and closing the menu until he is in a good position to strike.</p>

<em>Defeat Agahnim in Hyrule Castle without being harmed.</em></p>

<p>-=MISSABLE=-</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations: None.</strong></p>

<p>The worst part about Agahnim? Having to go through that entire dungeon again if you mess up. Joking aside, Agahnim isn’t too bad of a boss. He has three different attacks, of which one is very easily predictable- and avoidable. Whenever he goes to the most northern-middle spot, he will use a lightning attack that can be avoided by going to the left or right wall. The other two aren’t as easily identifiable, but shouldn’t pose too much trouble either. The red shot can be reflected with the sword (or bug net) right at Agahnim, and it’s recommended to stand straight across him to make sure it hits. The other attack is a bit trickier, as it is a blue circle that goes into 6 directions upon hitting a sword or a wall. You can hit it and hope the shield protects you if one of the directions is towards you, but I personally found that to be a bit too RNG-heavy for my liking. Avoiding the blue circle is definitely my preferred option. Keep this up for a bit and Agahnim is down.</p>

<em>Defeat Helmasaur King without being harmed.</em></p>

<p>-=MISSABLE=-</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations: Bombs. If you’re keeping this boss for later, you can also bring a Magic Cape/Upgraded Sword</strong></p>

<p>The Helmasaur King is an interesting boss: he’s not too difficult, but you have to be careful at all times. I recommend getting rid of the shield by dropping/throwing bombs (I prefer the former), as his movements are pretty predictable. It only takes 4 bombs to get rid of the shield, while it takes 16 hammer hits. The Helmasaur King only has two attacks to worry about: the first is where he spits out a fireball, that turns into three fireballs that implode diagonally. For this attack, it’s best to go to the wall that’s farthest away so you can easily dodge them. The other is his tail attack, indicated by when the tail starts moving faster. This is actually easily avoidable by standing directly in front of him. The only thing you need to be careful about here, especially in his second phase, is that he starts moving again right after the tail attack ends. If he runs into you, that obviously counts as damage. You can also avoid this by going to the wall that’s farthest away, but I find standing in front of him easier.</p>

<em>Defeat Arrghus without being harmed.</em></p>

<p>-=MISSABLE=-</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations: None</strong></p>

<p>Arrghus is a really easy boss, but you still have to be careful. ONLY Hookshot the minions off of him from the left- or right side, as doing it from above or below him has the chance for the minions to go too far into your sprite, damaging you when they’re travelling back. When he does his swirl attack, go to the exact opposite of the room as he can’t reach you. When all of the minions are gone, charge up your sword and keep walking around to make sure he doesn’t land on you. Arrghus only moves diagonally, so that should make his movements predictable. 4 charged sword attacks should end him for good.</p>

<em>Defeat Mothula without being harmed.</em></p>

<p>-=MISSABLE=-</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations: Magic Cape, Good Bee, 1-2 Magic Potions, Tempered Sword (or Golden Sword if you’re killing Mothula after the 5th and 6th dungeon).</strong></p>

<p>The easiest way to get rid of Mothula is by releasing the Good Bee and then going invincible with the Magic Cape while attacking with your sword. Keep good track of your magic meter and if necessary, drink a magic potion only when you are truly safe to do so as you won’t be invincible during that time. Watch out for the moving floor, otherwise you’ll run into a spike upon re-appearing.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations: Magic Cape, Good Bee, 1-2 Magic Potions, Tempered Sword (or Golden Sword if you’re killing Blind after the 5th and 6th dungeon).</strong></p>

<p>The easiest way to get rid of Blind is by releasing the Good Bee and then going invincible with the Magic Cape while attacking with your sword. Keep good track of your magic meter and if necessary, drink a magic potion only when you are truly safe to do so as you won’t be invincible during that time. Be extra careful with re-appearing as both the heads and their lasers will damage you.</p>

<p>Upon entrance, use the Bombos Medallion immediately to get rid of Kholdstare’s ice armour. From there, it really is up to you on how you want to beat him as Kholdstare isn’t too difficult–you just need to beware of the falling snow.

<p>Magic Cape is your best friend for the first phase as you can just stand in front of Vitreous and keep slashing and the eyes that keep popping out. When he only has 4 eyes left, the big eye itself will pop out. Just stand in front of the door and keep shooting at him with arrows as he won’t try to do anything except getting close to you.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations: Golden Sword, Magic Cape, 1-2 Magic Potions, Fire and Ice rod</strong></p>

<p>This boss might look menacing, but it’s not that bad. What you want to do first is getting rid of the ice head on the right. The head movements may be confusing at first, but if you have the Golden Sword you only need to hit it 3 times. You can hit 2 times per stun with the rod. If you do this flawlessly, you should be able to kill it before the main body attacks but if not, just back off for a bit as his only attack is very predictable: the head will lunge at you when the tail starts moving faster. This attack won’t hit you if you keep walking in a straight line. After taking care of the ice head, repeat the same for the fire head. Once those are down, use the Magic Cape to go invincible and you’ve won.</p>

<em>Defeat Ganon without being harmed.</em></p>

<p><strong>Recommendations: Golden Sword, 1 Full Heal Potion, 2-3 Magic Potions, Magic Cape</strong></p>

<p>Ganon’s fight has 4 “phases”, but the first 3 are pretty much insignificant as you can take care of all of them by just going invincible and slashing at him. You’ll need to drink a magic potion on his 3rd phase, but that should pose no problem as a lot of his time is spent just teleporting around. The 4th phase is where it can get slightly tricky, and where you also need to be cautious. You need to light two beacons while Ganon is shooting a fire bat at you, so make sure to light them fast with the Fire Rod. When he’s visible again, ONLY attack him when you know
where exactly he will appear, and if you can hit him the moment he appears. If you’re even a second late, he’ll fire his bat at you which is hard to avoid when you’re close to him. Hit him so he’s stunned, fire a silver arrow at him and repeat this 4 times. Take your time for the final phase and you’ll be just fine. If you do take damage, reset the game and drink a full heal potion as your health/magic bar won’t be full upon restart to ensure you can try it again very easily.</p>
