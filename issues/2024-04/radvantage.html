<p>RAdvantage for Daily Distractions evergreen, this isn’t as difficult as some of the other achievements featured, but I literally have 0 100 point achievements, and most of the 50s I have are just grindy, so here goes.</p>

<p>Hummer Team were a Taiwanese bootleg game developer through the 90s that are mostly known for making NES ports of games for more advanced consoles. Their most famous work is likely Super Mario World, colloquialy known as Chinese Mario World. In some ways, the port is impressive, with Yoshi and spin jumps on NES hardware. However the physics are gross, and make the stiff physics of the original Super Mario Bros feel like a dream. The game is also incredibly janky, I jumped on a parakoopa in mid air, and it fell through the floor, teleported to the top of the screen, and fell on me, killing me. So with that in mind, lets tackle the Dragon Coins in World 7, an achievement that at the time of writing, only 10% of the people who were already weird enough to play this have gotten.</p>

<p>Dragon Coin achievements in this set require getting all the coins in a level in one go, then completing the level. This means avoiding checkpoints, because if you die, you’ll want to start a level over from the beginning. Not every level has 5 coins, so you might be left wondering if you missed one if you finish a level with 3 or 4, only to see that you got them all when the cheevo pops. And some levels, like 7-1, have 0 coins, which is good news, because that was one of the tougher levels in the game, and I’m glad I was able to use the checkpoint.</p>

<p>World 7 only has two levels with Dragon Coins, 7-2 has 5, and 7-3, the ghost house, only has 2. Starting with 7-2, there are 3 coins before the checkpoint (which you don’t want to get), and the first half is relatively easy, with one tricky jump between two pipes guarded by a turtle that can be damage boosted through if you have a mushroom, and you probably will. The second half ramps up the difficulty, with some janky slopes filled with parakoopas, followed by a difficult section of numbered platforms. The 4th coin is tricky, requiring a well timed running jump from underneath through the coin and onto the platform above and to the right of it. If you get the first 4 coins, you’re probably ok, the 5th is pretty easy, there’s a bait mushroom at the top of the screen near the end, but if you stay on the 4 count platform, you’re probably ok. 7-3 is a tricky level, and the coins are annoying because the sprites are wrong, and they look like regular coins. There are none in the 1st room, luckily since there are a lot of very difficult jumps around boos and eeries. The second room has one, the normal looking coin above the p-switch(which seem to be useless in this level). Then, make your way to the right, and go through the far right door, where the second coin is on top of 3 of the blocks that look like the spin blocks from actual SMW. These have weird physics that are almost ice like, so be careful. Once you get your second coin, move through this room to enter a door leading back to the room with the first dragon coin, take the second door from the right in the long hallway, and you’re clear and the cheevo should pop.</p>
