        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><img src="https://retroachievements.org/Images/045872.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Welcome to the achievement guide for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/17454">-Prototype- Biohazard 2 | Resident Evil 1.5</a>! This guide was made on the fact that the game is highly undocumented and would prove difficult to get all the achievements only by trial and error, let alone progress the story normally. This guide will cover all the achievements currently on the set and if the set gets updated to include more achievements this guide will also be updated.</p>

<h2 id="achievement-summary">Achievement Summary</h2>

<p>There are currently <strong>84 achievements</strong> worth a total of <strong>1015 points</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="debug-protection">Debug Protection</h2>

<p>Due to this game being a Prototype it has easily accessed debug features that the original developers used to easily test their code ingame, due to the nature of these features the achievement set has protection against all of them, If you noticed an achievement didn’t trigger when it was supposed to it most likely was this protection kicking in and pausing it. The easiest way to not trigger them when you don’t want to by mistake is disabling the input for the <strong>Select</strong> button in your emulator of choice, Don’t worry you don’t actually need them to finish the game with either character. If you did use the debug functions however you can unpause the achievements by starting a new game with either character normally.</p>

<h2 id="save-support">Save Support</h2>

<p>The game currently lacks any sort of save support so if you die in the game you need to start from the beginning all over again, making these challenges more hard to get than in any other Resident Evil game, this is reflected in their values being double what they would normally be plus the game difficulty is increased due to the amount of hits it takes to kill any enemy so beware.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

<p>Currently, this game has 3 unique ROM(s) registered for it with the following RA Checksums:</p>

<ul>
  <li>42bd3a24c993b993a4f7992d0a29720d - Resident Evil 1.5 (MZD) + (25-12-2020 patch by MartinBiohazard) <strong>Main</strong><br /></li>
  <li>6fb2418c1078867555c2c79fd08f5746 - Resident Evil 1.5 (MZD) + (25-12-2020 patch by MartinBiohazard) + Play as Grant patch<br /></li>
  <li>57b8bc8a20cbc84117a4200b851b5f32 - Resident Evil 1.5 (MZD) + (25-12-2020 patch by MartinBiohazard) + Old Weapon Animations patch<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>All the above patches can be found in the official <a href="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAPatches/raw/main/PS1/17454-RE1_5-BH2_fixed.7z">RAPatches GitHub Page</a></p>
