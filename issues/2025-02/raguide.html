<h1 id="small-faq">Small FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="what-does-cherry-tree-rank-mean">What does Cherry Tree Rank mean?</h2>

<p>Cherry Tree Rank refers to the ranking you earn at the end of a boss fight, or the ranking you may earn at the end of the game. Cherry Tree is equivalent to an “S-Rank” in games like Devil May Cry. The worse you perform (Time taken, damage dealt to you) the worse your rank becomes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-is-a-artifact--holy-artifact">What is a Artifact / Holy Artifact?</h2>
<p>Artifacts are items you collect throughout your adventure that can be equipped in the Equipment section while playing. These usually change aspects of Amaterasu, such as having a longer range on item pickups, infinite health, or infinite ink. Some artifacts you are required to obtain throughout the story, while others are rewards for trading in Demon Fangs. These will be blocked for the challenge achievements as some of them do break the battle system.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-is-the-symbol-in-the-bottom-left-of-the-screen-why-is-it-sometimes-different-colors">What is the symbol in the bottom left of the screen? Why is it sometimes different colors?</h2>
<p>This is what’s known as Godhood. Godhood is a protecting barrier that surrounds Amaterasu that negates damage dealt to her. There are 3 levels in total, each level negating only 1 attack. If you lose level 3 Godhood, you go to Level 2, and so on. There are two ways to increase your godhood level</p>

<ul>
  <li>Perform attack combos</li>
  <li>Use Travelers or Godly Charms</li>
</ul>

<p>For any of the Boss challenges / Cherry Tree Rank Challenges, you may go into the fight with Max Godhood obtained.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7uAH1vI.png" alt="" /></p>

<hr />
<h2 id="the-cutscenes-are-so-long-can-i-skip-them">The cutscenes are so long. Can I skip them?</h2>
<p>Yes, but only once you’ve beaten the game once, and not every cutscene can be skipped sadly. This is a shortcoming of the game, so if it bothers you then you may always wait until NG+ to try some of theese</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-divine-instrument-should-i-use-beads-glaives-reflectors">What Divine Instrument should I use? Beads? Glaives? Reflectors?</h2>

<p>Okami is a wonderfully balanced game created by a team of people who really understand how to create a battle system: every weapon is viable and this is totally up to choice. My preference has always been Glaives; you can charge them up for devastating attacks which can make many fights trivial. Reflectors have the ability to, well, reflect. By pressing Triangle, you can reflect and counter some attacks. You’ll know you have done a successful counter as Amaterasu will grab the enemy, throw them in the air, then strike down on the enemy. Beads are an attempt at range attacks, some can be chained together like a whip while others can be shot out like a gun. Weapons can also be upgraded to be more powerful with gold dust, which can be purchased or found throughout the game. Once you find what weapon you like the most, upgrade it with gold dust.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reflectors - A balance between offense and defense</li>
  <li>Glaives - Heavy hits with an emphasis on offense</li>
  <li>Beads - Ranged attacks that deal more combos per hit than other weapons.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-are-stray-beads-how-do-i-get-them">What are Stray Beads? How do I get them?</h2>
<p>There is a much more comprehensive guide with pictures on where / how to obtain every stray bead. I have outlined some of them within the set, but not all of them have their own individual achievements.
<a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/221040-okami-hd/faqs/79107/stray-beads">Click here for a Stray Bead road map!</a></p>

<p>There are 100 Stray Beads in total. Each are numbered, so they should be easy to track to find which one you’re missing.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="end-game-achievements">End Game Achievements</h1>
<p>At the conclusion of Okami, you are presented with a final results screen that assesses your overall performance. There are five achievements associated with this, some of which require you to monitor your progress throughout the entire playthrough.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a class="gameicon-link" href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/246974" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img class="gameicon" src="https://retroachievements.org/Badge/273571.png" /> <span>Immortality, a God’s Best Friend (25)</span></a></td>
      <td>Earn a Cherry Tree Ranking on “Total Deaths” on the final results screen</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To achieve this, you need to complete the game with no more than four Game Overs and Continues. If you die, reset the emulator and load your most recent save. Deaths will only be recorded if you choose to use a “Continue” after a game over.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>

      <td>Earn a Cherry Tree Ranking on “Total Yen Collected” on the final results screen</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Achieve a total savings of 4 million yen or more. There are no restrictions on your spending; this reflects only the overall amount collected.</p>

<p>Collect 300 or more Demon Fangs throughout your adventure. Easy to complete alongside <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/246976">God of War (25)</a>. There are many methods to earning Demon Fangs, such as countering an enemy successfully with a Karmic Transformer, using the Golden Fury or Brown Rage Dojo moves, or the simplest; finishing a demon by cutting it in half with the Power Slash brush technique. Get into the habit of doing this as early as possible, by the time you reach the end of the game you should have many accumulated. This is also counting the total earned, so you may spend them on items.</p>

<p>Accumulate 4,500 or more Praise throughout your journey. This task is more straightforward than it may seem. Be sure to feed every animal you encounter, revitalize any dead trees using Bloom, and search for as many clovers as possible. Similar to Yen and Demon Fangs, you may use as much Praise as you wish, as the total amount accumulated is what counts.</p>

<p>This achievement involves finding and blooming every clover in the game. Some are obvious with large beams of lights, others are hidden in secret caves or on platforms that are out of the way. The key to mitigating stress from this achievement is to take it one area at a time.</p>

<p>Across Nippon there are animals that Amaterasu can feed in order to obtain more Praise. Some of these are by themselves, others are in groups. It’s important to keep at least a handful of all forms of feed in your inventory throughout the game, in case you encounter any along your journey. There are animals that can be missed, so just like with Clovers, take this in a area by area basis.</p>

<p>Here is a guide that encompasses all animals and clovers in each area.

<p>First achievement that stumps new players who aren’t used to the nuance of the controls of Okami. You must get dig up 9 turnips in a row without being hit; a very simple trick for this is to dig at the furthest turnip away from Mushi’s Mama. Once she starts coming towards you, lure her near and go into brush mode and paint some ink over her. This will “stun” her by covering her in ink; while she is busy cleaning herself off, you have another couple of seconds to dig one or two more turnips. Repeat this and the achievement is yours.</p>

<p>Waka is nice enough to telegraph all of his attacks at a reasonable speed. When Waka is standing still or when he is approaching you, go into Brush mode and drop a cherry bomb near him - once he touches it, it will detonate and deal a good amount of damage towards him. If he throws a sword, go into Brush mode and Power Slash it - it will return back to him and he will turn “grey”. When this happens, he is open for a Power Slash. Do this a couple of times and he’ll go down quickly.</p>

<p>The Spider Queen seems a lot more intimidating than she looks. As soon as the fight starts, sprint and start running around her in a clockwise direction. Go into Brush mode and attach vines from the upside down blossoms to the circular canes on her back. Once you do, she will be stunned and the flower on her back will open up, revealing her eyeballs. Go into brush mode and line up a Power Slash on at least more than 1 eyeball that you can see. Rinse and repeat quickly until her eyeballs start to die and vanish. This will more than likely take more than 1 cycle, but you should have enough time to do it again without worrying about the timer rank. After about 2 cycles, she should be dead.</p>

<p>On the connection path between Shinshu Field and Agata Forest, you’ll find Sleepy the Bear. This side quest involves bringing several round objects to him to see which he likes the most.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A large cabbage at the bottom of the path leading up to Sleepy.</li>
  <li>A Walnut close to Karude, behind a rock.</li>
  <li>A beehive hanging on a branch beneath a floating Konohana Blossom. Use Power Slash to get it down.</li>
</ol>

<p>My advice would be to roll the items to the left side of the mountain wall when rolling up to Sleepy, as the mechanics are not the most friendly to rolling in a straight line. You may find that the objects you’re rolling can just go off in the opposite direction, or even off the cliff entirely. Slow and steady wins this race; try not to dash as the faster you go the less control you have over the object you’re pushing.</p>

<p>Another boss fight. Crimson Helm is a raging bull enemy type, so expect him to come straight at you for his attacks. If he charges at you, double jump out of the way and drop a cherry bomb right in front of his face before he finishes his charge. His other attack is jumping and landing, causing a wave of fire to shoot out; simply double jump over them. Once he’s taken enough damage he will become stunned, so you take revenge and rush him! He won’t take any damage until his armor is knocked off and you’ve blown the fire surrounding his bones away. Once he’s naked, lay a full assault of attack combos and Power Slashes and he will be vanquished.</p>

<p>At this point in the story, Orochi has sent a sacrificial arrow marking the top of Kushi’s residence, and dooming her to a horrible fate. She asks Amaterasu to carry her through Shinshu field towards the Moon Cave so that she may offer herself to Orochi. Kushi will change her outfit and sit on Amaterasu’s back, and when this happens the music will change to be a triumphant, yet somber song called “Kushi’s Ride”.</p>

<p>Take Kushi through Shinshu Field towards to Moon Cave without being stopped by any enemy scrolls along the way. If you get near a Demon Scroll, go into Brush Mode and slash it to stun it. If you run near the Blue Scrolls, you will not be able to stun them, so keep your distance. Feel free to leap off of ledges as well - there is no fall damage, so take as many escape routes as you can.</p>

<p>Finally, you have reached the dreaded Orochi! Orochi’s fight is a long puzzle, but not difficult. He has 8 heads, all with different attacks and weaknesses, but they all have the same attack “pattern”. The head will attack you if you’re too close with a physical attack, but if you stand near the platform further away then they will commence their elemental attack.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fire - The Fire head will attack by blowing fire towards Ammy. Use Gale Force to blow it away</li>
  <li>Dark - The Dark head will spit putrid plants out. Use Bloom on them before they burst open.</li>
  <li>Wind - The Wind head will send a tornado that will follow Ammy’s movements. Use Gale force to blow in the opposite direction to cancel it out.</li>
  <li>Water - The Water head will fill the battlefield with water, where smaller Orochi snakes will swim and attack. Land on a lily pad and slash its head to make it stop flooding the arena.</li>
  <li>Light - The Light head will shoot laser beams down towards Ammy. Jump to dodge them easily.</li>
  <li>Earth - The Earth head will send tremors through the ground. Jump to avoid them.</li>
  <li>Lightning - The Lightning head will send balls of electricity downward. Jump to avoid them.</li>
</ul>

<p>After making each head drink the 8 Purification Sake, Orochi will become drunk. Attack the bell on his back, and once its health has been reduced enough Phase 2 will start. You will repeat the same tactics, attacking each head. This time, the heads have more physical attacks (Such as a left and right swipe attack and a lunging bite attack) and the bell will be shooting fire downward in different directions intermittently. Stay to the back of the arena to bait the head into lunging towards you, while keeping your distance from the fireballs being dropped from above. Make each head drink the 8 Purification Sake again and unleash all your attacks and kill each one.</p>

Two spiked barrels will be near by once the water is lowered; make your way there, jump on a barrel, and roll it towards the demon. Keep rolling it over until the Demon dies.</p>

<p>Time to face Blight inside the stomach of the emperor. The key to this fight is that when blight summons a circle of swords, you Power Slash a good chunk of them in one slash. Try to get the blue one so it reflects back towards him, which leaves him open for attacks. When he teleports, use Veil Mist to catch him as he is traveling from one point to another - he is a sitting duck during this. I find that he is easiest to take down when using Glaives, especially if you use the charging attack on him while he is teleporting and you’ve stopped him with Veil Mist.</p>

<p>Time to put your brush skills to the test. To start this sidequest, you must purchase Charcoal from the Tool Dealer first. After that, you will see a little girl who is drawing on the ground in the Commoner’s Quarters of Sei’an. Speak to her, then make note of the design in her thought bubble. Go to Mr. Chic and recreate the same design on a Kimono. Mr Chic should say “That pattern almost seems as if it could make something happen”. Go back to the little girl and see another design from her. Most of these are easy, except for the last one. Unless you know Kanji, it’s going to take a couple of tries.</p>

<p>This achievement first requires you to speak to Camille and Camellia at the top of Kamiki Village. Camille does not believe in the gods, but Camellia can clearly see the markings on Amaterasu. Bloom flowers in front of them, then headbutt Camille to make her believe that she is not in a dream. After this, both sisters will move to Sei’an City. Here you will have to prove your existence to them once more - this time however you need to make a tree sprout, then spray the tree with the secret technique Deluge after the tree has vanished.</p>

<p>To make a tree appear, simply put a spot of ink on the ground. Once you have done this, you’ll be rewarded with a stray bead</p>

<p>Komuso is a traveling monk who is plagued by demons throughout his travels. He will ask you to help him during several points of your story. None of these are missable, you just need to encounter them in order.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Kamiki Village - Near the middle point between the peak of the village. You should hear his flute once you run up the stairs by Mr. Oranges house.</li>
  <li>Kusa Village - Komuso can be found in a small bamboo grove, underneath the wooden walkway to the Gale Shrine within Kusa Village.</li>
  <li>Sei’An City: Aristocratic Quarter - When going to the Emperor’s Palace, look to the left side to see Komuso playing his flute underneath a tree. Talk to him one more time to initiate the last of his requests.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are timed arena challenges where must fight a particular amount of demons before time runs out. Most of these fights are trivial, and you may use whatever means at your disposal to win.</p>

<p>Several items in Sei’an City’s Commoner Quarter have gone missing! The culprit is of course, closer than you think. Light every torch around the City, and use Power Slash on the giant boulder standing beside a soldier keeping watch. Hayazo the thief will pop out and challenge you to a race. There are four races in all, each rewarding you a different item upon completion. Hayazo has 4 forms, all weak to various brush strokes</p>

<p>The fourth race is only available once you have cleared Oni Island. I end up waiting to do this particular race until I have unlocked Thunder Edge, as it is a source of infinite electricity, which can only be found on top of the ghost known as Raiden. Your chances of success will increase dramatically once you have Thunder Edge, or the secret brush technique Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Bit of a tricky fight to get down on your first attempt. Ninetails will hold his sword up as the fight starts, so make sure you make use of the lightning surrounding the area. Ninetails is invincible otherwise, but once he is hit by lightning he will split into multiple forms of Evil Rao. If you have the Fireburst technique already, this would be the time to use it as it attacks multiple enemies in an area. If you do not have it, the easiest way to start taking out the Evil Rao’s is to line them up in Brush Mode and strike them with a power strike and, of course, dropping cherry bombs on multiple groups when possible. The time for this fight is a little more generous than it would seem, so don’t stress if you miss one or two. Once all are defeated, Ninetails will turn into his true form and will be vulnerable to damage. He will try to charge you with a spinning strike - double jump out of the way enough times and he will get dizzy. Proceed to lay into him accordingly.</p>

<p>Yoichi is one of the archers that Amaterasu meets at the checkpoint before reaching Ryoshima Coast, the skinny one with the bow and arrow. After the checkpoint explodes (thanks to Ammy’s influence), Yoichi leaves his station to go to North Ryoshima near the Guardian Sapling on the small island to the north, then he ends up in Kamui facing a giant stone with a sun drawn on the side. In order to trigger this achievement, you must meet Yoichi 3 separate times and help his arrow find its mark</p>

  <li>Once at the City Checkpoint</li>

<p>This is the first real challenging boss now that we are reaching the end of the adventure; Oki has two forms</p>
<ul>
  <li>Human form, which attacks like Evil Rao and Waka, summoning swords that can be slashed away with a Power Slash and has easier attacks to predict</li>
  <li>Wolf form, a fight incredibly similar to the other Dog fights in the game, and is the hardest one of all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oki’s wolf form can become invincible once he howls or gets a blue aura around him, where he will end up charging at you. Like other bosses, plan where he will end his charge and drop a cherry bomb on top of him to deal massive damage. Keep your distance and focus on using brush attacks for a safe play, but charged up glaive attacks can deal large amounts of damage as well. If you want to be riskier, perform a double jump and charge your glaive, then release for a downward strike on top of him. You can also use veil mist to slow him down.</p>

<p>New boss fight; this is more of an RNG puzzle than the other fights. Both owls have attacks that can be fired back at them, focus on doing that and countering all of their attacks with Power Slash (all but ice). Lechku (Gold) will hold up his sword occasionally, make sure to strike him down with lightning, here’s a tip; now that you have Thunder Edge you can use it to cast Thunderbolt from Amaterasu to whatever you wish to strike with lightning, this way you don’t have to worry about your position in proximity to the nearest cloud. Nechku (Silver) loves throwing bombs your way, make sure you steer clear or them or explode them on your own with fireburst. You’ll be prompted eventually to shoot Oki out like a cross-bolt, knocking one of them down. Feel free to go crazy and deal as much damage as you possibly can. Be weary of their dive attacks, the worst part is how it can change the camera. Try to double jump over or strafe/dodge out of the way in time. If you’re worried about the timing, keep a bit of ink left to do veil of mist. Rinse and repeat until both are vanquished.</p>

<p>Phase 1: 
<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/67cb2ad52f8091a1c6f9a398210895c9151aee8bf12c40d2ade77838a37117d6/68747470733a2f2f7374617469632e77696b69612e6e6f636f6f6b69652e6e65742f6f6b616d692f696d616765732f302f30392f59616d695f636f6e636570745f6172745f322e706e672f7265766973696f6e2f6c61746573743f63623d3230323030323035323333393538" width="240" /></p>

<p>The end is finally here; all of your brush skills have been stripped, so this first fight relies on your ability to platform and sneak in a hit or two while defending yourself. Yami will jump up and slam down onto the arena as well as slam a hammer onto certain section to smash holes in the floor. Steer clear of them as if you fall it takes more and more time and damage off of your ranking. Run towards him and slam him with an attack from your divine instrument, he should get weak and drop Power Slash. One of Yami’s defensive moves is to launch rockets in the air, then towards Ammy. If you dont have Power Slash, go for a full sprint and carefully watch Ammy’s positioning before a rocket sweeps into her. Destroy his rockets with Power Slash. Deal enough damage and prepare for phase 2.</p>

<p>Phase 2:
<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e0d72d2c439a1213088b9cdbbd9759a652aef70895935316f51405e8d561aa57/68747470733a2f2f7374617469632e77696b69612e6e6f636f6f6b69652e6e65742f6f6b616d692f696d616765732f332f33322f59616d695f636f6e636570745f6172745f352e706e672f7265766973696f6e2f6c61746573743f63623d3230323030323035323332313339" width="240" /></p>

<p>This phase is slightly more annoying. He should start off by covering himself in flames and steering himself towards Ammy. Make sure you keep running and watch for his patterns, he seems to prefer a star shape. Once he’s done being ablaze, strike him and take back the power of Cherry Bomb! You know what to do by know - Start dropping bombs and he should pop open like a matryoshka doll. Jump up onto his platforms and start striking the little fish, thats Yami’s Heart and true form! Defend yourself with waterspout and keep striking until he’s had enough.</p>

<p>Phase 3:
<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c6b9fbe582b24ee10d9fc46d55fed3f1ea0c70c4c4fe76dc9c3122dc5a93fd6d/68747470733a2f2f7374617469632e77696b69612e6e6f636f6f6b69652e6e65742f6f6b616d692f696d616765732f322f32332f59616d695f636f6e636570745f6172745f342e706e672f7265766973696f6e2f6c61746573743f63623d3230323030323035323332313337" width="240" /></p>

<p>This phase tests patience more than any of the others. In this mode, Yami becomes a slot machine. Go into brush mode to stop his reels. There doesn’t seem to be a pattern on what you get for drops, but if you roll three of the light blue orbs with a hand coming from the bottom right, Yami will open up and expose his weak point. Try to aim for those. What you roll like fire and lightning is self explanatory, but the small one eyed monster symbol launches explosive balls towards Ammy. Launch them back with Power Slash. The fire that he sprays here is what kills a lot of runs, so be careful in your movements. This is a very RNG heavy phase, so be prepared for this to take up more of your time then the previous and the next.</p>

<p>Phase 4:

<p>This phase has Yami turn into a sumo-esc mech. Occasionally, the front panel will open and expose Yami - Be sure to Power Slash it or damage it with your instrument for some easy damage. In this phase, Yami will fire a gigantic beam of energy from his face, but you can easily double jump over it; right after, he usually fires a beam going from downward to upward, then a beam sweeping at his feet. He will sweep with his tentacle arms and launch missiles above which you can deflect back. Once you get enough small shots on him he will start dropping more of your brush techniques. Once you get thunderstorm, you can shock him by either using the storms or Thunder Edge; once he’s shocked, he will fall onto his face with his rear end exposing his true form.</p>

<p>Phase 5:

<p>After a heartfelt (and very long) cutscene, Amaterasu is finally facing the ultimate form of Yami. Once the fight starts, immediately draw a sun in the sky to brighten up the battlefield. Yami should throw down his true form, leaving it obviously exposed. Lay into it with everything you’ve got, Power Slashes, bombs, and combos. His attacks are quick, so keep enough of a distance from him so you’re not locked in the center when he sweeps or tries to grab you. Occasionally, he will throw his true form above him and fire a laser - before he gets the chance, use Power Slash to stun him once more. If he sends a tornado your way, counter it with one of your own. As a fully powered god, he should stand no chance against your arsenal.</p>

<p>Great news, Okami’s NG+ feature is ready for you to use. Simply save your game after defeating Yami, accept your end game rewards, and load your save from the main menu! You will begin a new journey, keeping all of your items from your previous one. This includes equipment and Stray Beads collected. This may also be repeated as many times as you’d like, so you can keep playing at your own pace since NG+ is not blocked by the set.</p>
