<p>Pokemon’s third generation introduced a number of new mechanics to freshen up the gameplay. From abilities to Pokemon Contests and beyond, Game Freak had awesome ideas. One mechanic, double battles, were introduced and popular enough that most modern official Pokemon tournaments use the double battle format. So many Pokemon, abilities, and moves were designed to be used in double battles. Unfortunately, the generation that introduced double battling has very few double battles to take advantage of the unique strategies of the mechanic. Enter Pokemon Emerald: Double Edition.</p>

<p>Double Edition is a romhack of <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/668">Pokemon Emerald</a> that makes nearly every battle into a double battle. The game’s difficulty curve has been adjusted to match the extra experience, alongside a number of other quality of life additions from later games like the Fairy type, updated moves and movesets, and the physical/special split. The only thing missing is achievements from our site! We already have an achievement set for Emerald, so some of the idea work and legwork for some achievements have likely been taken care of. Double battles are a gameplay style that don’t get as much love, so hopefully a dev can come around to give players an extra incentive to check them out.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a giant? This is the game to fulfill that fantasy. This is a Japanese only title, with no English translations. UFE3 expands on the combat and increases the move counts for each character (a few of said moves being unlockable). Boasting a count of 37 playable characters, it is the largest Fighting Evolution game to this day. The characters all feature completely different move sets that all fall in line with the source material.</p>

<p>The story mode is a large chunk of the game, featuring specific scenarios from the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/9195">Ultraman</a> series. This not only can catch some players up with the stories of previous entries (it’s a series that at the time was on for 38 years), but it can also give a fresh and new take on these stories, such as including a cut ending in the first mission.</p>

<p>Ultraman Fighting Evolution 3 can offer a challenge to new players and veterans of the series alike, making room for a challenging but rewarding achievement set for the game. This game is a true hidden gem of the PS2.</p>

<p>Developed by Silicon Studio and published by <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/27460">FromSoftware</a>, this is a time-traveling isometric action-puzzle game where you have 60 seconds to set up whatever you can for the next versions of yourself in the same allotted time. You’ll be working with yourself; timing and holding down switches, defeating the more beefier enemies and bosses, even intentionally killing yourself on spike traps to deactivate them. Puzzles get more complicated as you move on such as various spells, summoning stone statues to hold down switches and wind to defeat enemies and blow out lanterns. It’s satisfying to see your past versions moving like clockwork as you finally beat the level on your last ninja.</p>

<p>The game isn’t lacking in style; featuring beautiful ukiyo-e artwork and great fitting music. Foes range from ninjas to mythological creatures with huge bosses the size of half the screen.</p>

<p>Story mode has you go through various levels, gaining experience and attribute Points to spend on upgrades, while the mission mode has set attributes with goals to get more score. Both have a ranking system that would be great addition for a set.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the game is entirely in Japanese. Getting a guide together explaining the controls and menus would be necessary.</p>

<p>The final game in the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/13283">Devilish</a> series, things have taken a turn for the worse. The visuals are bland and the soundtrack is boring. Even worse, the speed of the ball was drastically reduced and just feels sluggish. I haven’t played much of it, but I still think this game deserves a chance at a set. Achievements for deathless, speedruns, and score could (potentially) greatly improve the playing experience. Overall, this game just looks like a big disappointment, BUT if you dev this set you get onto my special list of very cool people and that’s really all that matters.</p>

<p>Kaiju-Ou-Gojira for the Game Boy isn’t for everyone. It’s clunky and slow-paced, with constant screen bouncing and the need to stand still to refill your health, which can be frustrating. However, for diehard <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/9000">Godzilla</a> fans, it carries a certain charm.</p>

<p>One of the game’s standout features is its wide roster of kaiju. Fans of the franchise will appreciate seeing kaiju that aren’t in very many games like Manda, Gezora, Kumonga, Titanosaurus, and Garbera. The inclusion of so many rare and iconic monsters is a major draw, especially since few games pack this much kaiju content. The graphics, while limited by the Game Boy’s hardware, do a commendable job of making these monsters recognizable and detailed.</p>

<p>The gameplay won’t impress everyone, and the pacing can feel tedious at times, but there’s fun to be had once you get the hang of it. Many bosses have predictable attack patterns, making them easier to defeat once you’ve memorized their moves. Godzilla’s atomic breath is great for blocking projectiles, while his tail attack offers invincibility frames; both are key to beating the game. For those willing to overlook its rough edges, Kaiju-Ou-Gojira can be a fun achievement set, especially with so many of the best monsters from the Godzilla series.</p>

<p>There is a very challenging game that I have always loved and would like to play with a set - Tron: Deadly Discs for Intellivision.</p>

<p>I had an Intellivision when I was little, bought it again as an adult, and the game continues to fascinate me. Maybe the controls are not very simple since the controller is very different from the current ones, but I am sure that with a few analog sticks you can do something. The first time I played it was at my cousin’s house, and from that day I pestered my parents to have it. I got it years later, and I was very happy with it. It would be great to be able to unlock achievements when the opponents change color, or when you break one of the opponents’ discs, or when you manage to knock down that damn robot! I am sure that I could not complete a set, but I could certainly have a lot of fun!!!</p>

<p>I noticed that there is a set for the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/13076">Atari 2600</a> version. No harm to the Atari fans, but the Intellivision version is something else entirely, especially because it creates synesthetic memories in me that the Atari version cannot!</p>

<p>Vrooooom. Brrrr.</p>

<p>Sorry, sorry, I was playing with my Hot Wheels. Why was I here again?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Hot Wheels: Beat That!, it doesn’t have a set. Well, I can always talk about what you are missing out on I guess.</p>

<p>Hot Wheels: Beat That! is a unique game even in the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/1160">Hot Wheels</a> series, being that somehow, you really feel like you are made of plastic. The controls are floaty, which at first can put you off the game, as it makes it hard to really start learning the game, but this is to make room for a very powerful drifting system.</p>

<p>While not on the same level as other racing games when it comes to their drifting mechanics, it feels amazing to finally figure out the clean lines needed to beat certain tracks. Which brings up the tracks themselves. If you have ever played a Hot Wheels game, you know that the tracks try to encapsulate the feel of being a toy racing in some normal space.</p>

<p>A bedroom, mini-golf course, an attic, and a bowling alley all appear in this game to surround your toy car with vibrant sections and cool ideas. From driving through a train set, to drifting around pins, you’ll find yourself entertained by the tracks and the music that accompanies them. Even if I have my suspicions about possible “inspirations” for said music.</p>

<p>The sense of progression in the game is locked by a type of mission like structure in the game modes, leaving some of the monotony of just racing to the sideline. The game modes aren’t really different from one another, just be in 1st, probably the biggest weakness of the game is that you are just racing or blowing up cars, but then again, a kid wouldn’t want anything different.</p>

<p>Overall, it won’t beat out some of the best Arcade Racers, but it doesn’t need to. Cause at the end of the day, you are just a kid playing with Hot Wheels again.</p>

<p>Chimera Beast is an arcade horizontal shoot ‘em up developed by C.P. Brain around 1993, but never officially released. On a planet similar to Earth, creatures called eaters threaten the ecosystem with their ravenous appetite. In most games, they would be your enemy, but in Chimera Beast, you play as one! You control an eater as it evolves from a microorganism into a massive monster, with each level representing a stage in the eater’s transformation. The eater has a standard shot, which can be charged for a more powerful attack. You also have the ability to detach the eater’s mouth and take a bite out of enemies, which can not only restore health, but give the eater a unique power-up based on whatever it ate.</p>

<p>“The game your nostalgia remembers” was the tagline YouTuber TheSmithPlays used to launch the Pokemon Legacy series. Throughout this series of hacks, you get to replay the Pokemon games of each generation in what is basically a remastered version of the original. Adding more variety in your encounter tables, allowing you to catch a complete dex without trading, tuning up boss fights, and giving some balance adjustments along the way, Smith tries to make your favorite playable and usable at some point in the game no matter what your favorite is - while still honoring the spirit of the original. This isn’t some backbreaking difficulty hack, like the Kaizo series or Run &amp; Bun - though it does play slightly harder by making weaker opposing trainers into stronger ones. One of the coolest features of the game is the hidden trainers near the locations of certain prominent static encounters, giving you one final test before acquiring each of the strongest static mons on your playthrough. A true love letter to the franchise and all its quirks, I can’t wait to play Pokemon Yellow Legacy the RA Way!</p>

<p>This is a very popular QOL hack for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/557">Sonic Advance 2</a> which improves the level design massively, as well as improves elements around the Special Stages such as SP rings. With this being the only hack for any Advance game (to my knowledge), there could be room for improvement, but this hack is very worth playing as while it makes Advance 2 more fair, it doesn’t go overboard and the previously mentioned level design changes make a playthrough of the game much more bearable, which is perfect for a set!</p>
