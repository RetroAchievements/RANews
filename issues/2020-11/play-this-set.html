        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>This is a place where achievement creators (and sometimes their fans) can advertise their work and tell the community why they should play those games (with achievements).</p>

<p>Our idea is to post 10 “Play This Set” per month. If you want to advertise your set (or a set you’re a big fan of), write a couple of paragraphs and send us a message (go to <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/RAdmin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAdmin</a> page and then “Send Private Message”).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: don’t get frustrated if your article isn’t published in the next issue! If yours is not present here, it’ll probably be present in a future RANews issue.</p>

<p>Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver are one of the most loved entries in the series of Pokemon. It has one of the highest amount of content in the series, allowing the player to explore the two regions of Johto and Kanto, battle the Battle Frontier, catch a lot of legendary Pokemon, rematch all Gym Leaders, play in the Pokeathlon and more.</p>

<p>The set rewards the player for exploring all these elements of the game. Some emphasis is also on doing the little side quests the game gives you, like getting the Gift Pokemon, getting items from the Week Siblings and collecting the shiny leaves. Also included are achievements for beating the important gym battles with a level cap and without super effective attacks, so you have to strategize more around which Pokemon to use.</p>

<p>You can also get achievements for the special Wi-Fi events, so if you want to do them, you can find on the game’s forum topic both a default save at the start of the game with events enabled, and special saves right before each specific event.</p>

<p>We recommend playing the game on RALibRetro and there’s support to play the game’s Spain, Italy, Germany and France versions, so if you’re only familiar with your country’s Pokemon names, you have the option to play in your language.</p>

<p>A man is seeking to revive the Lord of the Underworld to eradicate humankind. You, the chosen hero, are fated to confront this evil creature. However, you are not alone: seven other heroes share your destiny. Scattered about the world, these heroes each set out on their own journey, seeking to unite themselves with the hero and fulfill their destiny.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest IV introduces a chapter system. Each chapter, you start fresh with new characters. In a sense, each chapter is a bite-sized RPG adventure. Build up your levels and equipment as you explore each hero’s own part of the world.</p>

<p>One thing I appreciate is the diversity of the heroes’ abilities. Each hero is of their own distinguishable job class. While you may have favorites that you prefer to keep in your party, you will also find yourself often swapping to another party member to make use of their unique capabilities, depending on the situation at hand. This is most enjoyable during certain boss battles where you have access to the entirety of your party, constantly switching your line up mid battle.</p>

<p>If you enjoy RPGs, then you must play DQIV. This game, in fact, was my first introduction to the Dragon Quest series. That said, it is an excellent point at which to start playing the Dragon Quest games. Play it, finish it, and be left hooked for more.</p>

<p>Harvest Moon 64, also known as Bokujō Monogatari 2,  is a farming simulation game developed by Victor Interactive Software and then ported to the west by Natsume (not to be confused with their eyesore of the misspelling “Natume” on the title screen) for the Nintendo 64, hence the 64 in the title. It was the 4th game in the series, the second for consoles and was probably where the series started to really get its attraction and following.</p>

<p>The plot of the story is that you, the player, are given the farm which was abandoned by your grandfather who passed away. Essentially you start with your basic tools and a messy farm field which you need to clear to grow crops. You also have a chicken coop and barn for animals which you can raise. You can also work to upgrade your house and some farm buildings to help maintain your farm as well. There are many things to do in the game like little side quests with the townsfolk, festivals and other various events. There is a great amount more in this game than their previous titles, especially the Game Boy games.</p>

<p>While the game was released on the N64, I never really got to fully experience the game until I was an adult, when I finally bought a copy (really expensive now) for my wife (girlfriend at the time) for her birthday. The game was a great experience, far more enjoyable than I was expecting as I had played other great games in the series such as Animal Parade and Back to Nature prior to playing Harvest Moon 64. The series is a very casual series and I found it very heart warming. The relationships you can develop with the characters I found very adorable, collecting the pictures for each marriage candidate was rewarding and even pressing on to help out the town with it either being through stuff like the bridge, hot springs and even saving a vineyard gave for some great stories that kept the game from getting boring.</p>

<p>Sure, the game or series may not be for everyone but for those who love casual simulation games, this is definitely one to try. The gameplay is fantastic, the art style and artwork is great, it has some wonderful stories throughout it and plenty of stuff to do, and of course, it has your farming as well. The set only came out a short time ago so if you were looking for a time to play it, the time is now. I hope this game impacts you as much as it has me.</p>

<p>Sonic Rush came out in 2005 as Sonic’s first step for the DS. Swapping out the sprites that the Advanced games used and using 3D models for the characters. Rush introduces a new character to the series, Blaze the Cat, and adding a boost system which would end up being used in future console games such as Unleased and Generations.</p>

<p>Each character has their own storyline, with Sonic and Tails taking a traditional storyline of taking down an Eggman, the twist being this one claims to be from another dimension. Blaze the Cat ends up meeting Cream while trying to find the mysterious Sol emeralds to get back home. Her storyline is about learning to trust others for help and better understand her own powers.</p>

<p>Sonic Rush has 7 zones to speed through, 8 towering bosses and even a bonus if you can find all the emeralds for Sonic. The gameplay is fast and frantic, and the music was composed by Hideki Naganuma of Jet Set Radio fame. This game is definitely worth playing through.</p>

<p>Hello everyone again, I present a very cool game that you probably already played or saw something similar, games like Guitar Hero, Band Hero, Rock Band, those games that mix the feeling of a rock concert, are you ready for that? Let’s go!</p>

<p>Like other Rock Band games, the Story mode follows the player’s band through their career, starting by playing gigs at smaller venues and taking requests for special performances. Different from the original ones, the story also adds Lego-ish adventure elements. The default band members are Sir Thomas, Penny Twilight, Nicky Overdrive and Quentin Lance from Rock Band 2, but after prologue you may unlock and buy other band members to replace the original four via “Rock Shop”.</p>

<p>In addition, the game also features Rock Power Challenges, where you can challenge and show all your skills as a musician against a boss.</p>

<p>There are also challenges in QuickPlayer mode, if I just want to play your favorite songs.</p>

<p>Songs like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Counting Crows - Accidentally in Love</li>
  <li>Sum 41 - In Too Deep</li>
  <li>Europe - The Final Countdown</li>
  <li>Queen - We Are the Champions</li>
</ul>

<p>They are just examples of classic rock from the 80s and 90s and many other hits.</p>

<p>Take your guitar my band friend and let’s make this stage shake. long live Rock and roll.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to try out the games before you purchase them, or in this case, before you request a set if you have a free slot. Well, in Euro Demo 10, you can try out the 4 games with no sets. This issue includes a preview for Olympic Soccer, developed by Silicon Dreams and published by US Gold. As for playable demos, take a military helicopter for a test drive in Gunship, beat the daylights out of your opponent in Battle Arena Toshinden 2 and get behind the wheel on one of the two tracks from Supersonic Racers, also known in the US as Dare Devil Derby 3D.</p>

<p>I noticed there were not many fishing games on RA, and none of them were River King games! That was unforgivable, so I decided to make this set. This game is quite unique, as it is a full blown fishing RPG adventure. You get to roam around, earn money, buy tools, get a boat, explore 5 decently sized maps, and catch 46 different fish.</p>

<p>Did I mention there is RPG Combat? You, as a small child can kill a bear, with your FISTS! Is it the best fishing game out there? Nope, that would be Fishing Resort on the Wii. Is the the best one currently on RA? You bet it is. If you like fishing games, you will enjoy your time with this game.</p>

<p>Ironsword is the second episode of the Wizards and Warriors saga, it came out in 1989. You control a knight named Kuros who must fight Elementals (Wind, Fire, Earth and Water) before he can put an end to Malkil, an evil wizard. I actually had no idea how these games looked like (even though I do have the Ironsword original cartridge:D). I decided to create a set for it since it was the most requested game for NES, and there is already a set for W&amp;W1 and W&amp;W3. So basically is this game you fight, jump and pick items in five different worlds, where you have to find golden objects to please a king animal that will help you on your quest.</p>

<p>There is an interesting RPG aspect in this game : you can find (or buy) armors, swords and helmets to have better attack and defense, get magical spells scattered through the land of Sindarin that will be handy in tough situations. Game is short but hard (typical for NES), you can use passwords though (even if the set has a protection, achievements will only trigger if you deserve it ;) )</p>

<p>To master this set, you’ll have to find every object and extra life, every secret area, the mandatory no-death cheevos, I suggest you to jump everywhere so you can find secrets! To be honest, I really had a good moment creating this set, the gameplay is nice, music is cool and I understand why it was requested by so many people.</p>

<p>Bloody Wolf is a game by Data East, in 1989, port of an arcade game that came out the year before.
You control Snake and Eagle, two commandos of the Bloody Wolf special forces. You have to save hostages and the President and make your way throughout eight stages.</p>

<p>I never heard of that game before I noticed that it was the most requested game for PC-Engine. Watched a longplay and found it interesting enough to create a set for it;) The game, a typical run and gun, is strongly influenced by Konami games like Contra and Metal Gear. You can use several weapons, from the spread gun to the bazooka, you also have a secondary weapon (mainly grenades).</p>

<p>But the gameplay is more varied than in Contra: you can enter buildings, save hostages, use a motorbike, fight in the water… There is also a real story, even if it’s not the most original one, and it’s always nice to know why you’re shooting everyone:D There are several useful items to find throughout the game, allowing you to open chests, having a better armor and so on.</p>

<p>Game is tough, there are many enemies on screen (too many sometimes, inducing an important lag now and then), sub-bosses and bosses can be really hard to beat. But you can’t blame the gameplay, it is excellent. So if you like run&amp;gun games, you can give it a try. A shame you can’t play it with a second player though, like in the arcade game… Good luck!</p>

<p>Drawn to Life is your typical platformer game for the Nintendo DS…or maybe not. From the same developers of the Scribblenauts franchise, this cute little game lets you, as the Creator, design your main character as well as the weapons, platforms, gadgets and many other things that will help you in your quest to save the Raposas from the shadows.</p>

<p>At first glance it looks like a kids game (until you get to the 2nd boss, good luck getting the no damage cheevos there) but the different mechanics the game has to offer, like the character’s abilities, weapon types and the long levels designed for exploration (can you find all the secrets and breakables in each level?) will keep you entertained for a while.</p>

<p>As for the unlockables, besides the music tracks of the game you got a bunch of color palletes, patterns and stamps in order to customize your creations further, so it’s up to you if you want to recreate your favorite character by pixel art, make your own “OC do not steal” or just stick to a stick figure to enjoy the game.</p>
