<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Shadow of Night is a Zelda II hack made by the_icepenguin in 2011. The game has significantly overhauled assets and updated graphics to produce an immersive new setting that supports the gameâ€™s theme.  Some game play changes include a new spell that adds a new physics mechanic, lack of enemy stun lock, improved beam sword speed and distance, the need to revisit palaces to obtain previously inaccessible items and keys and much more.</p>

<p>The hack saw several updates from its initial 1.0 release to the final version 2.5. The final version comes with two patches, an Easy mode and a Hard mode. This set was created with the Easy patch because the only difference between the two is the amount of damage that Link does and takes and how many starting lives you are given. The game design is challenging enough that the added handicap to health, damage and lives does not add much more than frustration to the experience.</p>

<p>The achievements in the set are a mix of progression and challenge achievements. The progression achievements are pretty typical for increasing Linkâ€™s strength, obtaining key items or reaching new destinations. The challenge achievements are mostly focused on defeating bosses/minibosses under certain conditions. None of the challenge achievements are frustratingly difficult or require a significantly abnormal approach to gameplay.</p>

<p>There is a long play of the hack available, but it was done with a slightly out dated version of the game. There are a few minor differences from the version of this game that is used for Retro Achievements such as a few item locations and palace design updates. This guide ensures that players have all the information needed to successfully master the set and understand what the differences in the long play videos and the current version of the hack are.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

<p>The achievements require the following <a href="https://retroachievements.org/linkedhashes.php?g=19538">linked hash</a>:</p>

<p>The below maps do not match the in game palette, but more clearly indicate the true assets.  For example, in game the hammer breakable boulders are not distinguishable from regular mountain tiles, but these maps depict them in their true form.  The white boxes indicate tiles with subareas, many of which contain lesser items not listed on the maps.  The listed map items are those required to master the set.  Some items will need certain spells to reach such as Jump, Dash or Fairy.</p>

<h2 id="achievements">Achievements</h2>

<p>The missable achievements are all associated with defeating bosses and minibosses under certain conditions. The reason they are missable is because once a boss is defeated, it will not respawn.  With a bit of caution, it is very easy to ensure you do not accidentally miss any missable achievements. All of the missable achievements will display the achievement icon in the bottom right letting you know when the achievement is active. If you accidentally make an error, simply die and restart the boss fight in order to attempt the achievement again. If you accidentally do kill the boss and miss the achievement, reset your game and restart from your previous save file.  If you save after you kill the boss, the achievement will not be obtainable on this play through.  The following are the missable achievements in this set.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Death by a Thousand Cuts [m]</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t Give an Inch [m]</li>
  <li>Helmet Fire [m]</li>
  <li>Stick and Move [m]</li>

<p>This achievement is available the second time you fight Horsehead in the Desert Palace. As soon as you approach him and the battle begins, immediately execute a jumping, crouching attack to hit him backwards. Stay aggressive as he plods forward to ensure he will not progress further than his initial position. The key to success is to quickly land the first attack and continue to keep up the pressure thereafter.</p>

<p>While there will be three Gooma fights in the Forest Palace, the first encounter is the easiest since there are no other enemies present. Use the Dash spell to increase your running speed. When you attack the Gooma, run in and execute a crouching attack and as soon as it hits run away. Try to preserve distance by hitting the Gooma with the tip of your sword.  It is important to actually hit the Gooma to send it backwards and give yourself a bit more time to run away.  You cannot be too passive in this fight or the Gooma will back you into the corner and you will likely not survive.  If you are having difficulty, increase your attack level.</p>

<p>This achievement can be done starting from either side of the room. The key is to have Dash selected before entering the room and while holding the directional pad to walk, cast Dash without stopping that input. It is important to save time in the first half of the room by not slowing down at all. You should run off the first ledge and then begin jumping and skipping a ledge during the first half of the room.  For the second half of the room, you should plan to land on each ledge, but continue to move quickly. This is not an extremely tight achievement, but there is not much room for unnecessary delays.</p>

<p>As shown in the video, jump from the grass and ensure that you release the directional pad before Link crosses over the bottom step. Continue to jump as soon as Link touches the ground and he will preserve his momentum during subsequent jumps. Eventually he will start losing speed, but it should not be especially difficult to achieve this.  Casting Jump and/or Dash will make this significantly easier.</p>
