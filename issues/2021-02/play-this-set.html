        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>This is a place where achievement creators (and sometimes their fans) can advertise their work and tell the community why they should play those games.</p>

<p>Our idea is to post up to 10 “Play This Set” per month. If you want to advertise your set (or a set you’re a big fan of), write a couple of paragraphs and send us a message (go to <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/RAdmin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAdmin</a> page and then “Send Private Message”).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: don’t get frustrated if your article isn’t published in the next issue! If yours is not present here, it’ll probably be present in a future RANews issue.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift is the sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance on GBA. This time, it follows the character Luso Clemens as he gets transported to another world through a book, much like the first game. There he forms a clan, where he can recruit characters from various races and complete hundreds of quests.</p>

<p>The game is a turn-based tactical RPG, where the player gets into battles with a party of characters from Luso’s clan. Each battle can have different objectives, like simply defeating all of the opponents, defeating a specific enemy character or surviving for a number of turns. Depending on their race, the characters have a few jobs available, from over 50 total jobs. They can master abilities from those jobs in battle by using certain armor or weapons, which will make it so the character can equip skills without having the weapon/armor equipped and even when switching jobs. By learning abilities, the character can also unlock other jobs and learn more skills.</p>

<p>The game also has a equipment crafting system, where they can unlock weapons and armor at the shop by crafting them in the bazaar. With the game’s 300 side-quests and over 50 jobs, the player will be able to get into a lot of battles to earn the materials required to craft these equipments, which they can then take to other battles and learn more skills.</p>

<p>The set is great and covers everything the game has to offer, having achievements for completing the game’s several side-quests and engaging with all the gameplay mechanics. It also has 40 very creative achievements for completing important battles, each with a different restriction imposed, so the player has to plan and switch between different strategies if they want to complete the challenge achievements.</p>

<p>This game is a must-play for any tactical RPG fan, and I fully recommend this set as one of the best sets on the site for this genre.</p>

<p>The remake of the first installment of the well-known saga “Tales Of” with a revamped battle system, a new playable character,  a lot of skits to deepen the story and character motivations, new graphics and couple of videos. Very attractive additions for those who enjoyed the original.</p>

<p>The battle system features a some mix between action and VS games, making it fun and less tedious than turn-based games. Can be enjoyed by anyone but can also be mastered taking full control of the character with the Combo Command item, making the battles very satisfying. This set has both easy progression achievements and challenges for those that seek more of their game. Either way you’ll need to become a JRPG master to beat this game!</p>

<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater (THPS) was developed by Neversoft and ported to the Nintendo 64 by Edge of Reality. THPS features ten different professional skaters as they travel around the United States, “shredding” it up and competing to complete different goals. The game features arcade-inspired physics which allows the player to perform tricks that would otherwise be impossible to accomplish in the real world.</p>

<p>The set was designed to differentiate from the Playstation 1 version of this game. Point goals, standard goals, and random objectives have been designed to challenge the player in unique ways. The coup de grâce of the set is the speedrun achievement. Not only does the player have to show skill in being able to complete each objective. They must take it to the next level by competing to beat the clock.</p>

<p>Whether you are into completing objectives and moving onto the next game or are seeking some more challenge. This set was designed for a little bit of every player.</p>

<p>Hi all! Do you like the Pokemon series games? Have you ever wanted to solve a mystery, while playing as a pokemon? Then, this game is for you!</p>

<p>Growing up, this was one of my favorite games to play on my DS. You wake up on a beach, with a mysterious pokemon towering over you asking if you’re okay. Your memory is gone, and you don’t know where you are. Little do you know that, this Pokemon would not only become your exploration partner, but your best friend as well!</p>

<p>Developed by Chunsoft and released on April 18, 2009, this game features 92 unique locations and over 400 pokemon for you to recruit for adventures! As well, it contains an amazing storyline, post-storyline, and Special Episodes on other characters in Wigglytuff’s guild.</p>

<p>If you like RPGs and Pokemon, this one’s for you! I developed this set in a little over a week, and highly recommend it. If you’re looking for an RPG with consistency in challenge and fun, this one is worth mastering.</p>

<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 is a skateboarding game developed by Natsume and published by Activision. The Game Boy Color version follows the same formula as its console counterparts, you are racing against the clock to cross goals off your list for each stage to become the greatest pro skater. THPS2 lets you choose from 13 of your favorite skaters each with different stats, multiple boards you can buy, and a special grind move. Skate through a variety of stages, taking you from the streets of New York to the skies of Skate Heaven. The stages appear in either standard side-scrolling format or a 2.5D top-down perspective. Each stage has four goals and each goal crossed off gives you more money to buy board upgrades or new stages.</p>

<p>The achievement set offers a variety of achievement types including progression, collection, and scoring massive trick points on each stage. Along with the achievements there are leaderboards for most points in a single run, most points for a single trick, and highest single trick combo for every stage.</p>

<p>Do you have what it takes to become a Pro Skater?</p>

<p>I’m not going to lie to you, this is the worst version of Donkey Kong Country. Even the gameboy re-imagining (DK Land) is both more creative and more functional. Still this is a well developed set with great challenge for the player. Snow may have put more care into this set than the actual development team porting it. I say that because DKC GBC is as close to “Kuso” as any Donkey Kong game has ever reached. The colors bleed on screen, the music is off key, and the controls respond when they want too. The game even struggles to realize when you find all the minigames sometimes taking multiple attempts to load correctly.</p>

<p>And yet, there is small bits of magic here that aren’t realized until the GBA version. Yes, dear reader this game is a port of the SNES game but the GBA game is a remake of this game. If just to see what went so wrong, it is worth playing Donkey Kong Country on GBC.</p>

<p>YS III is an action RPG that continues 3 years after where I and II left off. It differs from other entries in the YS series by being the only side scrolling platformer. You play as the main character, Adol Christin, who is traveling with his friend Dogi back to Dogi’s hometown. Upon reaching the town you are informed that monsters are roaming the area, hunting the inhabitants and destroying the crops. Like a true hero, Adol springs into action and gets to work!</p>

<p>This iteration has been ported multiple times since it was first introduced on the PC-8801 and the PC-9801 in 1991 and when compared to its SNES counterpart the Mega Drive entry is objectively the better version. Mechanically, the SNES and Mega Drive versions are similar but have a few subtle differences in how certain rings function as well as the necklace item not working at all in the SNES version. The level design is also slightly different between the two.</p>

<p>The achievement set is heavily progression based with a few challenges thrown into the mix. All of the bosses, aside from the final boss, have damageless achievements and one of the bosses has to be defeated damageless with the most basic equipment. There are also achievements for things like getting to the first boss without killing an enemy and traversing the final dungeon without a light source.</p>

<p>If you are new to the YS series this is a perfect place to start!</p>
