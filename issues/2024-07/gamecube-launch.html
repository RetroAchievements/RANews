<p>RetroAchievements is proud to announce support for its 52nd console, the GameCube!</p>

<p>The Nintendo GameCube launched in Fall 2001 as a successor to the Nintendo 64. It features a handle so you can whack people with the Gamecube and yell “that’s my purse, I don’t know you!”. The system used mini discs which actually spin backward as an attempt at anti piracy. This primarily worked until the end of the system’s lifestyle. Unfortunately the mini disc format was hard to develop for by third-party developers. Although the GameCube was not the lowest powered system of the generation (that honor went to the PlayStation 2), it did often receive buggier versions of ports. Still, the system was not short on power or exclusives and boasts some of the most memorable exclusives in the generation.</p>

<p>With this launch, RetroAchievements is proud to announce this was our <strong>Biggest Launch</strong> of all time with over 100 games here at release. That means GameCube will launch with over 25% of the system’s library already available!</p>

<p>This project was spearheaded by <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/LillyJade">LillyJade</a> at the coding helm, and the entire project at this point was a good 2 years of work. We also have to thank our partners at the Dolphin Team for working with us to get this product out the door.</p>

<p>We also need to thank the Writing Team led by <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Nepiki">Nepiki</a> who have made sure these sets are up to a high standard for English readability. We also can’t forget to thank the Dolphin Testers for taking the sets and beating them with a hammer to find lingering bugs and errors. Finally, thanks go out to the Rollout Team who have helped over the past two years including <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Snow">Snow</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/StingX2">StingX2</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/TheMysticalOne">TheMysticalOne</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/AuburnRDM">AuburnRDM</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/pinguupinguu">pinguupinguu</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/televandalist">televandalist</a>, and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Sutarion">Sutarion</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an event for the GameCube launch is now ongoing as well. Check out <a href="https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=27246">this forum post</a> for all the details regarding this event!</p>

<p><strong>With RANews, we wanted to take a look at each of the games released during this rollout and give you a short introduction on what to expect. This will be split up into two articles, with each covering a random set of 50 games! Here is the first set for you to check out:</strong></p>

<p>Based on the manga and anime series by the same name, Naruto: Clash of Ninja is a 3D Fighting game where you pit popular characters against each other, such as the main protagonist Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura and Sasuke, and many more, each with their own specialties. The player can choose to do so in a variety of modes, ranging from your usual One Player and Two Player modes, to Survival and Time Attack mode and of course the Story which follows the “Land of Waves” arc from the first part of the series where you play exclusively as Naruto. Playing each of these modes will unlock new features over time, such as new characters and stages. The set will also focus on clearing modes as each character and unlocking new features, so strap on your headband as it’s Ninjutsu time!</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted a console exclusive, disney, point and click for the gamecube? Then do I have a treat for you! Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse is all of those things and more. In this game you are repairing a broken magic mirror to get back home but you need to perform pranks along the way. The gameplay is fairly simple but just enough or a puzzle element to be a true point and click. So go help Mickey already!</p>

<p>It’s a me! Wario! Are you tired of games that stink? Are you tired of getting thrown in the wrong directions by chucksters? What about triforce fishing trips that take hours? And don’t get me started on Melee! The only reason I’m not in it is because Sakurai was jealous of my glorious rear! That’s why I got the people who made Sin &amp; Punishment, Radiant Silvergun, and Ikaruga to make a 3D Platforming Beat ‘em up: just for ME! WAH HAH HAH! Go through four wacky worlds and beat up weird guys who get in my way to collect treasure and build golden statues of yours truly! Then beat up bigger guys to collect keys to fight the final boss! Sure it’s not a long game but that’s why I got ThatAmericanSlacker, who did the achievements for Sly Cooper, Sin &amp; Punishment, and Wipeout Pure to make me an extensive set to make sure you get the most out of my game! WELCOME TO WARIO WORLD! Have a rotten day!</p>

<p>In the far future, racing has changed: the F-Zero tournament is THE sport of choice for amateur of speed! From the studio that also gave you Super Monkey Ball and would two years later go on to develop this little indie series known as Yakuza comes the pinnacle of velocity on the GameCube. Boost your way across 5 Cups, 21 tracks and a tough-as-nails story mode full of whacky characters involving the fate of the world! And even after all of this only the truly dedicated will be able to take on the harshest challenges requiring to beat the game devs at their own game, literally. Don’t know what Snaking is, think MTS is something you should ask your doctor about? Then it’s time to put on your seatbelt and learn how to properly handle a vehicle going at thousands of km/h, only in F-Zero GX!</p>

I’ve upgraded your visual modalities, but be careful. This is a highly specialized task force group. They’ve only gotten smarter with time. We need you to stop this impeding <strong>N</strong>uclear <strong>G</strong>iant <strong>C</strong>risis.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy. You’ve heard of it before, but Crystal Chronicles wants to let you know it’s a little different. Set an in Unknown World, players up to four set out on a grand adventure to collect Myrrh, a droplet of water from Myrrh Trees that must be given to the Crystal in their village to protect it from Miasma for another year. With four different Races to play as: Clavats, Lilties, Yukes and Selkies, all with their own weapon and armour types, unique fighting styles and stats you’ll have no shortage of how you want to tackle this world. Crystal Chronicles tasks players with entering dungeons, traversing the pathways, dodging traps, solving puzzles and slaying foes all while rewarding them with Gil, Magicite and Materials. Let’s hope our new travellers can keep their village safe and purify the world of Miasma! For the Core Set, which covers majority of the content in the game, is done in Single-Player mode. You’ll find some fun and unique boss challenges, exciting side quests, plenty of collectables and other miscellaneous secrets. Players will also have the option of two subsets - The first one being a Rare Drop &amp; Crafting subset; designed for those players that want to grind materials and Gil to craft the legendary equipment the game has to offer. The second subset is a Multi set! You’ll be able to partner up with a friend (or 3!) and tackle the dungeons within the game. It’s always better to journey with company.</p>

<p>If you can’t beat the racing competition, eat them. Who are you? That’s right, Kirby is coming right back at ya with his very own racing game! Speed along the ground, fly through the air, and outplay the competition through three special modes: Air Ride with its many unique vehicles, Top Ride’s chaotic top-down racing, and City Trial to explore a large city to gain stat boosts before going head-to-head in one of many competitions to see who has the best vehicle.</p>

<p>As you play, complete challenges to fill out the checklists and unlock new features, colors, and sometimes new items and vehicles, can you accomplish all 360 challenges? But the fun doesn’t end there, as many achievements have been made for new challenges, think of them like an expansion on what’s already there. Race using specific vehicles and with a handicap, eliminate the other players in a timed race, and prove your skill in the stadium matches. Whether you’ve played the game before, or if this is your first time, WanderingHeiho welcomes you to try this easy to learn and hard to master racer. Get ready to Air-Ride-in-Style!</p>

<p>Mario has more moves than ever, and you’ll have to master them all to sprinkle water in the sunshine! When a vacation goes awry and the man in red gets framed, it’s up to Mario and his trusty new water pack F.L.U.D.D. to tidy things up and bring this mysterious impostor to justice. Your itinerRAry takes you from the sunny shores of Gelato Beach to the calm cliffs of Noki Bay, including a goopy inferno of challenges to keep you on your toes while you clear (and clean) your name! With 120 Shine Sprites to amass and a fair share of subsets for the seasoned tourist, there’s plenty to do during your action-packed stay at Isle Delfino!</p>

<p>All those subsets and you still want to play MORE Super Mario Sunshine? Well you’re in luck, as Super Mario Sunshine Arcade 2 got your back. This hack features a total of 96 unique levels, with 48 of them being from the original hack. This one will be on the harder side but if you have overcome the original Sunshine, it is certainly worth a shot. This set also comes with challenges for each level, like getting all blue and red coins, with the latter also being covered as a speedrun of the level. Race through levels both with- and without F.L.U.D.D., and prove that you are the true Sunshine master!</p>

<p>It may not be Spider-Man 2, but it’s a game worth remembering. Play through the events of the movie (Plus a few bonus storylines!) in a gameplay style similar to the Neversoft PS1 game, featuring the voices of Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe. Movie Maguire not quipping enough for you? Look no further, as you’ll find plenty of that here! The achievement set features individual achievements for the challenges provided by the game itself, including Measured and Challenge Indicators where appropriate. But don’t let the difficulty of some of these challenges scare you! If you’ve unlocked Organic Webbing, you’re allowed to use it. Also covered by the set are all the training minigames, if you just can’t get enough Bruce Campbell.</p>

<p>Join Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antillies in their struggle against the Galactic Empire!  Rogue Squadron 2 is the sequel to the popular Rogue Squadron and Battle for Naboo games on the Nintendo 64.  Even though it is a GameCube launch title, the game features some of the best graphics on the system at an incredible 60 fps.  The story starts with the famous attack on the first Death Star and features other famous battles such as the Battle of Hoth and the Battle of Endor.  Other missions invent brand new scenarios during a time when Star Wars games were encouraged to extend the Expanded Universe, such as explaining how the Rebel Alliance stole the Imperial Shuttle used in Return of the Jedi.</p>

<p>Bub, Bob, and friends are back at it again in another bubble shooting adventure! If you are familiar with the Puzzle Bobble/Bust-a-Move franchise, then you know exactly what to expect: a variety of modes where you shoot colorful bubbles up to the top to match them, making sure all of them disappear before moving on to the next one. There isn’t a lot new aside from large-sized bubbles and an additional mode for multiplayer but hey, if you just want to shoot bubbles then you will be right at home. Clear all sorts of puzzles modes collecting all letters, and take on CPU Battle Mode as every character in this expansive achievement set.</p>

<p>With multiple personalities, navigating complex noir plotlines and political conspiracies all by your lonesome is a thing of the past! In SUDA51’s debut release outside of Japan, we follow the “killer7”, a symbiotic group of assassins tasked with doling out the US government’s dirty work. All the while keeping it stylish and bizarre in the true SUDA51 fashion. Wrapped up in a nice little rail-shooter package, Killer7 will have you in action-adventure heaven as you solve puzzles, collect items, and dispatch a bevy of eccentric enemies with a cast of extraordinary characters - all with their own set of unique abilities. What more could you ask for? Achievements, that’s what, and this set aims to cover it all! Want to challenge yourself in Killer8 mode, or unlock Hopper7? We got that. But if you just want to collect all the things, max out your skills, or fight bosses in challenging ways, we got that covered too, and we’re sure this set will bring a smile to your face.</p>

<p>Fire up your jet engines, and get ready to embrace metempsychosis, as you fly face-first into projectiles across five stages of a bullet hell masterpiece! Wait, that’s not how things usually work, right? When they happen to have the same polarity as yours, though, the powerful counterattack your ship releases will have you eating those dots in no time! Released in 2001 at Japanese arcades, this classic received several ports, with the Gamecube release’s achievement set now available! Alongside playing through the game, you will be testing your skill by doing so with no deaths, no continues, or while earning high ranks, whether S++, or the highly coveted title of a Real DOT-EATER! Like with other console releases of the game, you will also play through the Prototype Mode, which will have you conserving limited ammo that you recover through absorbing others’, as the developers originally envisioned. Fly high, and eat bullets for breakfast! Godspeed!</p>

<p>[Message received… Sender: Creator… Subject: Hints of a Heroic Invasion]
Attention all units, I have received rumors that those troublesome animals are at it again in hopes of foiling my plans. They must think of my brilliance as that of a fool! Even if they can obtain all the emblems and A ranks, I have some new tricks up my sleeves. A new set of challenges to delay their advances. They will need to scour those fourteen levels to find the many secret items and alternate routes. Not only that, there’s a new set of challenges for those levels ranging from score attacks, solo characters, sneaking without that troublesome chameleon, along with many more for my fights against them or against each other.</p>

<p>There’s some talk about that cat’s party finding different goal rings, but that’s complete nonsense if you ask me. And I’ve received some reports of those pests going into the Bonus Challenge Special Stages, what could they be doing there even when the Chaos Emeralds are not around?</p>

<p>This fight won’t be the same as what came before, let’s see if their skills can even come close to trivializing this new plan of mine!</p>

<p>1 Day Since Impact</p>

<p>My ship, the S.S. Dolphin, was struck by a meteor, and I was forced to make an emergency landing on this strange alien planet. I thought all hope was lost, but luckily I encountered these strange living plant-like creatures. I’ve decided to call them “Pikmin”. They seem responsive to my whistle, and I can throw them to attack enemies and interact with the environment. In larger numbers, they can tackle tasks even I would think were unfathomable, like returning my missing ship parts!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this planet’s environment contains high levels of poisonous oxygen, and my life-support systems can only function for 30 days. I must recover my 30 ship parts and escape within 30 days. Failure is not an option!</p>

<p>Not only is it the best selling game on Gamecube, for some, it is THE reason to have a Gamecube. Even after three sequels, many players find themselves coming back to it. In fact, you might be playing it as we speak. There’s few games with the reputation and legacy of Super Smash Bros. Melee. Taking Smash 64 and turning it into a massive experience and party game powerhouse, offering an epic Adventure Mode, the start of Home Run Contest, the return of Break the Targets, and the premiere multiplayer experience on Gamecube, Super Smash Bros. Melee has not only outlived its home system, but even later games in its own series. I’d write something else here to sell you on Melee but let’s be honest: I don’t have to. You’ve booted up the game by now.</p>

<p>Where in the world is Mario? A really weird contest appeared and Luigi has just won a new mansion, but the flyer looks a whole lot different from this perpetual poltergeist party! Armed with a vacuum cleaner and a flashlight, Luigi has to come to his senses and capture all the ghastly residents to save Mario from the King of the Boos. Luigi’s bravery is stronger than his fear, and he will overcome all sorts of challenges and puzzles to save his big bro. He’ll also make sure to clean up all of the cold hard cash!</p>

The achievement set will test your skills both at normal- and maximum speed, with a bunch of time trials waiting to be conquered. It’s time to prove you are the very best at tube sliding!</p>

<p>Necroth’s forces are threatening the Five Realms and robbing the world of Skittles®, and stealing the colors of the rainbow. I guess it’s up to me, Skye, a kick-butt warrior hero adventurer goddess (okay, maybe I’m embellishing a bit), to figure out how to stop that weird loser. Oh yeah, and this demonic pipsqueak, Draak, came through a portal and is helping me on my journey, I guess.</p>

<p>Necroth stole the power of the Skittles® and redirected the rainbow to his realm to increase his power. But there are still some Skittles® left, for those who know where to look. They are the source of my magic power. Necroth doesn’t know what’s coming for him! (Unless he read the back of the box– in that case, he’ll be adequately prepared)</p>

<p>Mario Party has been a staple on Nintendo consoles ever since the Nintendo 64, and that’s no different with GameCube. Mario Party 5 expands on those games by adding new modes, new characters, new items, but still the same type of zany, wacky fun. Will you try your luck on each of the new boards first? Or perhaps defeat Bowser and his Koopa Kids in story mode? From a plethora of minigame modes to tank battles, this Mario Party game has it all. Do you have too many bad memories of losing friendships over Mario Party games over the years? Well now’s a good time to rekindle those friendships and work cooperatively together to complete the accompanying Multiplayer subset launching simultaneously at launch. Will you be skilled enough to master both of these sets, or perhaps you’ll need a bit of good luck on your side? Anything can happen in Mario Party 5!</p>

<p>Wake up, Kagetora-sama! You were screaming commands in your sleep! Are you really that eager to get back to war? I can relate; I have been dreaming of great conquests and achievements. While full of sorrow and hardship, I can feel in my very bones that we will triumph. With our giant Odama and your masterful commands, our army is sure to crush any in our way. I also saw many paths in my dreams…paths of mercy and paths of destruction. I saw many horses and bountiful harvests. I even saw into the future, where we recruit our decendents and they told me of many amazing inventions, like “Pinball,” “Gamecube,” and “microphones.” I’m not sure what it all meant, and yet I was filled with nostalgia. I know our journey will be difficult and filled with strife. Sometimes our army may even refuse to listen to your commands, but I believe in you! Please master the Way of Ninten-do!</p>

<p>Attention! Inhabitants of Earth,</p>

<p>We, the Vortaak, have seized control of your planet’s monsters and will use them to rule over your world! Select your champion from a pool of 11 ferocious monsters. Take the offensive by fighting your way to our Mothership; but be warned, this adventure will require you to face 8 opponents including our ultimate monster, Mechagodzilla. Or take the defensive and try your best to survive against an endless wave of monsters. How many monsters will you defeat before you crumble beneath our superior intellect?</p>

<p>You may now return to reading about inferior Nintendo GameCube games… idiots.</p>

<p>Let ‘em rip! Based on the hit series under the same name, Beyblade arrives on the Gamecube in this Action game with RPG elements. Create your own Beyblade and partake in a variety of tournaments to become the best Blader around. Knock them out of the ring, make them stop spinning, or break them with your Bit-Beast to gain points. Level up to get more hit points to take on tougher foes as well, and claim a variety of Bit-Beasts as your own. Using these Bit-Beasts in a tournament will also be one of the objectives of the achievement set, where you need to win a tournament with all of them. With a dosis of fanservice and a bunch of popular characters showing up, this may be a game to look out for.</p>

<p>The 1998 Survival Horror classic Resident Evil 2 made its way to the GameCube in 2003. While somewhat disappointing that it was only a straight port, and not a full remake like what its prequel received, there is still much to appreciate about the GameCube release. It contains all of the content from the PlayStation DualShock release, playable at a higher resolution with better quality sound and FMVs. It’s also the only port besides the Nintendo 64 to fit both Leon and Claire’s scenarios onto a single disc, allowing you to more easily switch between scenarios as you wish. Another major quality of life change is the ability to skip nearly all in-game cutscenes, not just the FMVs like the other releases, which perhaps could make this port a speedrunner’s dream. It might lack some of the exclusive content of the N64 and Dreamcast ports, but the GameCube version is still a very nice version of Resident Evil 2 to play.</p>

<p>Mario and friends take to the diamond to play America’s favorite pastime: Baseball!</p>

<p>However, this is no ordinary baseball. Each of the 30+ playable characters have their own stats and abilities, and some characters even possess “Star Skills”, allowing for special pitches and batting hits like Mario’s Fireball or Yoshi’s Egg Ball. You’ll also find a “New Game+” style collection of campaign missions to complete for every character to try to unlock their full Superstar potential.                                                                        <br />
Complete with achievements for a full campaign mode, minigames, and more, immersive yourself into the Mario Superstar Baseball ecosystem. WE LOVE BASEBALL!!!</p>

<p>Ready for one more round of topsy turvey, twisty turny action? “Kururin Squash!” is the final release in Nintendo’s wonderful little series, and the only non-handheld entry in the bunch. This time, there’s 40 stages to carefully navigate through, collecting lots of coins along the way. Beat the game to unlock “Slippery Slip” mode, a fast paced race to the finish where you don’t have to worry about Helirin’s wings getting in the way; slip through tiny gaps to get faster times than previously thought possible! Beat that mode and you unlock yet another extra mode that changes your perspective to really mess with your muscle memory. Check in with the shop from time to time and cash in all those coins you’ve collected for more fun bonuses! And don’t forget to check out the “Super Player” subset! Push yourself to the limit to get the best times possible and aim to be Super. It may be irritating, but stick with it and I’m sure you’ll succeed!</p>

<p>GT Cube is the Japanese-exclusive sequel to GT Advance 3: Pro Concept Racing, and the first game in the series to stray away from handhelds to make its console debut. It was later re-released on Nintendo Wii and brought to the west in the process, but we are not there yet so let’s instead see what GT Cube has to offer! You will race on ten tracks through a variety of championships, license tests, and of course the classic time trials. It features cel-shaded graphics, and is a nice blend between Arcade and Simulation racers. Given how the console was lacking in somewhat realistic drivers, this may just be the one you want to keep an eye out for!</p>

<p>Good morning, RAngels. How are my favourite three private investigators doing? Listen, I got another job for you. National monuments all across the world are disappearing, and I need you three to find out what happened to them. I will send you out to the beach in bikinis (very important), where you will start fighting anyone who object you in a beat ‘em up environment. Punch and kick your way through various locations, and progress through by pressing switches or hacking into computers. Make sure to not lose lives, and knock the challenge up a notch when needed. The fate of these monuments are in your hands RAngels. Good luck!</p>

<p>Swings your arms from side to side, come on it’s time to go, do the Mario! Take one step, and then again. Let’s do the Mario, all together now!</p>

<p>The popular Dance Dance Revolution series returns, this time with music of our favourite plumber! With Waluigi attempting to steal the four wish-granting Music Keys but failing, the keys scatter across the kingdom. Now it’s up to either Mario or Luigi to dance through the kingdom to recover them, dancing along a wide variety of remixes from Mario and Donkey Kong games, as well as popular songs such as the Turkish March from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka from Johan Strauss II. If the story mode wasn’t enough for you, there are also some minigames to check out for high scores, utilizing classic DDR controls. Save the Mushroom Kingdom again with the power of dancing!</p>

<p>Radirgy was initially released in the arcades, and is one of the most distinct-looking bullet-hell shoot ‘em ups from the time with its cel-shaded graphical artstyle. It ended up being ported to Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and of course the GameCube, with it being very close to getting localized. Sadly it did not leave the country of the rising sun, but fortunately that won’t be an issue for us as it’s perfectly playable without any knowledge of the language needed! There are a total of five stages to take on in either Arcade or Manpuku mode, with three different ships that all come with different speed settings and weapons. Dodge the bullets and chain combos to rescue your father and the medicine to your radio waves allergy from terrorists!</p>
