<p>Wrestlemania XIX (19 in Roman numerals) is the second GameCube <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/7625">WWE</a> wrestling game (I have to say that because WWE Crush Hour is on the system, but that is simply a WWE-themed remix of <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/7689">Twisted Metal</a>) released in 2003 and predates the Day of Reckoning duology.</p>

<p>What makes Mania XIX stand out is the single-player adventure called “Revenge Mode” where you select a character, and Vince McMahon (the boss of WWE) fires you and kicks you out of the company. Vince’s daughter, Stephanie, wants to get back at her father, so she will give you a contract if you are willing to help ruin the big event. So then you go around the construction site, the harbor, the shopping mall, and the parking lot beating up security guards, workers, and even other wrestlers, and also destroying property along the way. This mode does not return for the Day of Reckoning games, which is a shame, because this seems like a good idea.</p>

<p>To show what you can expect from this mode, here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GfMrGMFi6A">Mah Dry Bread playing as snobby Harvard graduate Christopher Nowinski</a>.</p>

<p>The first <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/23409">Nicktoons</a> game in the series - though it had mixed reception with fans, it’s the one that started it all! Nicktoons Unite brings the characters SpongeBob SquarePants, Timmy Turner, Danny Phantom, and Jimmy Neutron together to save their universes from being destroyed by an alliance of villains from each universe known as the Evil Syndicate!</p>

<p>The story starts when SpongeBob wants to visit Patrick, but hears that Plankton is taking over Bikini Bottom and big vacuums are sucking up all the citizens. While SpongeBob is scared, a portal opens up, and through the portal comes Goddard with a message from Jimmy Neutron. While SpongeBob thinks this is all a dream, SpongeBob takes Jimmy’s offer to save their universes!</p>

<p>This game also uses cross-save to unlock costumes! Your PS2 memory card needs to have either <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/20249">SpongeBob SquarePants: Lights, Camera, Pants!</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/20694">Barnyard</a>, or <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/19483">Tak: The Great Juju Challenge</a> save data to unlock the costumes that are, Mermaid Man SpongeBob, Danny Fenton, Action Packed Timmy, and Secret Agent Jimmy.</p>

<p>Bosses in this game can be intense, but I know you can do it! I can see a lot of Nickelodeon games with not as much love as they deserve, so if you’re willing to take on the challenge and make achievements for this game, I have some ideas that I’d be willing to share!</p>

<p>Kaijus. Giant robots. Destructible environments. 3D fighting game.</p>

<p>A rough approximation of the cult classic video game, tasking you with fighting a myriad of classic Hollywood and Japanese giant monster movie archetypes through multiple wonderfully designed environments. Each map is rife with secrets and, as was most advertised at the time, destructible buildings. Every level is a giant playground to climb and jump around as you brawl a monster and, given time and persistence, you can flatten to complete rubble. Each character is also varied in how they fight and move, making each playthrough that much more varied in how you uppercut a giant gorilla into a building before following it up with tossing an entire bus at its face.</p>

<p>There are also several minigames that you can play, the purpose mainly for fun and gathering tokens to unlock costumes and the hidden characters. While, functionally, it is a simple game, the atmosphere, music, and moment-to-moment gameplay really help make it stay as memorable as it is even 20+ years later. Even now, it’s been brought back for the PS5 with its own set of achievements, and this isn’t to mention Sony’s past history of consistently porting the game to its library for the PS3 and PS4. It really is a great game to experience, especially with friends, and I would love to see the ingenuity of what developers could come up with for achievements to both entice new and old players, but also hopefully make it as special to said new players as it is to old.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to wrangle a zoo full of dinosaurs? Well, now you can! Or….I guess you could 24 years ago, actually. Jurassic Park III: Park Builder is, as the name implies, a park building simulation game about managing a zoo full of dinos. It’s a bit like the more popular Zoo Tycoon, but on a handheld instead. Some of the big ol’ lizards behave well and will act nice towards parkgoers, while the more aggressive species will try to get out and attack your guests, inevitably ruining your park’s reputation. The game is quite difficult for a kids game, with money particularly being a constant struggle.</p>

<p>Different buildings and attractions can be placed like most park builders, along with research that can be funded toward extracting new dinosaur species from fossil excavations. Your visitors will get bored of seeing the same Triceratops every day, so you’ll need to frequently add new dinos for the masses to gawk at. Speaking of dinos, this game actually features the most of any game in the franchise - over 100, so that’s pretty cool, although they reuse the same sprites a lot.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the game released a few years before the more well-known <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/5406">Jurassic Park</a> management sim, Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis, but fewer people seem to talk about this one for some reason. Both are worth checking out, and neither has achievements yet.</p>

<p>You ever had a stressful day? Wanting to just relax and enjoy some video games to relax your mind? Well, I got just the game for you. This is a farming game in which you take the role of a teenager who just wanted to go to his grandpa’s house and take his belongings after he passed away, then leave. But a fairy and 3 little spirits convinced you to stay and help them save their town from destruction. And you decided to be a hero and help everyone somehow.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid though. You have plenty of time before the mission deadline. You can take your time exploring the town and make new friends. You can collect berries, plant crops, dig for minerals, raise animals, and upgrade your house so that you may finally have a bathroom.</p>

<p>Do note that there is a remastered version of this game for the PSP which has more content added and more activity. But what separates the PS2 version is its beautiful and unique art style. And the fact that it’s easier to save the town. And it requires less time for you to finish it. So if you are a person who also wants to complete a game faster, you can start with this version of Harvest Moon.</p>

<p>I personally have spent hours playing this with the original PS2 console back in the days, until there was nothing left for me to do. But I still want to do all of that over again, hopefully with achievements this time. You can’t find many games nowadays that you want to replay after one complete playthrough, which makes this game a real gem in my opinion.</p>

<p>Naruto: Ninja Destiny is a very fun 3D anime fighting game series that, in my eyes, is a predecessor to a lot of the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/5687">Naruto</a> fighting games we know and love today. For a nearly fully 3D fighting game on the DS, it is pretty impressive. The character models, while not the best looking, still hold up pretty well, and there is lots of voice acting. Each character even has their own special moves straight from the anime. The story mode is also pretty good as well. The first game takes place around the Chunin Exams, and the second game takes place near the beginning of Naruto Shippuden. In both games you can also use the touch screen to do things like substitution. Also, the music is pretty good in battle and through menus. I really hope that these games can get achievements. I think that any Naruto fan or fan of 3D fighting game fans like <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/994">Tekken</a> would really enjoy this game.</p>

<p>“What could possibly go wrong?” - Dr. Muto, moments before the planet exploded.</p>

<p>Dr. Muto is a gritty, grimy collectathon following the, ahem, scientist as he goes through the polluted, industrialized worlds owned by Burnital to restore the destroyed planet. Dr. Muto is an absolute character, both in terms of the game itself and the literal character in the game. Every voice line oozes with charm, and the doctor’s eccentric mannerisms make him a treat to watch engage with the world through his various inventions. The most notable of these is his Splizz (yes it’s weird, don’t think about it), which allows him to transform into a selection of creatures for the required job, all created by the DNA harvested from the various creatures in the different worlds up to and including their alternate forms. The good doctor is also armed with different weapons and tools that are unlocked as you progress through the game, each utilized in some way to further your goals in repairing planet Midway.</p>

<p>It’s hard to both recommend a game solely off of the atmosphere and vibes, as well as describing it in written format without video or auditory accompaniment to best illustrate the point, but it is one of the best things about Dr. Muto. Every collectible has a crisp “bleep-bloop” when touched, gadgets crackle with electricity like a Tesla coil, and the synth music perfectly fits the rusty metal world in a style somewhat similar to <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/3070">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>’s OST. Every minor collectible from isotopes to major like terra and the Genitor 9000 parts is a finger scratching an itch in my brain regardless of how many times I hear it.</p>

<p>That said, it wouldn’t be becoming of me to highly praise Dr. Muto without acknowledging its more clunky design. While mechanically it is sound, and it even has a fun water level to boot, its platforming leaves a little to be desired in the weird preciseness it asks of you. Some jumps feel like you’re just barely making it, some feel more like luck than not over whether or not you move the right way, and Dr. Muto’s movement feels a little rigid. It’s almost like controlling a vehicle more than a person, or at least a weird hybrid of the two. Also, the game is a little notorious regarding its isotope placement. Basically, some were placed a little too close to walls or floors and would disappear past them. Also, whenever a level changed by artist additions or revisions, the developers neglected to note the placement of the isotopes and couldn’t fix it. Supposedly some can still be collected, like the wall/floor ones if you scrape your body against the spots where they are, though the developers’ in a rush for time made the True Ending only require 80% of the isotopes needed and said “hey, if it works, that’s all you need.” It’s a bit scuffed around the edges, but I still love it all the same for the ambition put into the game and with what’s currently there.</p>

<p>You can still love something while acknowledging it’s not that great; there are many, many other collectathon games on the PS2 alone that are tighter in its mechanics, with better testing and smoother controls. However, Dr. Muto is still a world worth experiencing, as it’s the only game with a world like what it delivers, and I hope that if the PS2 or Gamecube gets an achievement set that people can see and enjoy that dirty, metallic world all the same.</p>

<p>The Sega Saturn is sorely lacking in JRPGs, but one that immediately springs to my mind that I played a lot in my early teenage years was Blazing Heroes, known as Mystaria: Realms of Lore in Europe, or Riglord Saga in Japan. It is a grid-based strategy game akin to <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/65">Shining Force</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/11246">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, or <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/6715">Fire Emblem</a>, but with a much more limited cast who each have specific roles they fulfill. You will gain a small army of 12 by the end of it all, so there’s no need to worry about convoluted party management and figuring out which characters are better than others. Yes, there may be some bad characters among these 12, but you will get adjusted to each one’s style and discover how they are supposed to be used. Everyone is assigned a set of skills according to their talents, and they level up the more they are used. Furthermore, this allows for some customization into what skills you want to boost for that character. For example, Ferral can either use long-range spear moves like Spear Attack and Spinning Spear to maintain his distance, or can focus on martial arts moves with Punch and Kick that require him to move in close to enemies. Likewise, the cleric Saura can use either healing or fire magic. Whichever route you use per character, they will earn skill points to boost an existing skill or unlock new ones. You are able to repeat maps to increase these levels if you so wish.</p>

<p>The plot involves Aragon, prince of Queensland, fighting against the wicked sorcerer Lord Bane. Aragon’s mother has been magically brainwashed by Bane into giving him complete control of her country, and Aragon has made it his duty to reclaim his land while discovering what Bane’s motives are. The prince will gain allies from both others being besieged by Bane and his cronies, or disillusioned warriors of Bane who wish to rebel against their former master. The overall plot might be a bit forgettable, but it is non-linear in your approach to which characters you recruit to bolster Aragon’s army, and will adjust itself according to the choices you make. The graphics are understandably dated by today’s standards, but don’t let that sway you from the experience. It is so fluid and functional that if it was given some more love, it would’ve been the start of a fantastic series.</p>

<p>If you want to bolster your Sega Saturn repertoire, or are looking for a simpler tactical RPG that doesn’t involve horrendously unfair RNG à la Fire Emblem, this will scratch the itch as much as it did for me.</p>

<p>Digimon Rumble Arena 2 is a very fun party style fighting game, similar in ways to <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/1386">Smash Bros.</a> There are lots of different Digimon to play as, and each one can Digivolve into 2 different Digimon, meaning more room for different play styles. There are lots of very nice looking stages, and the soundtrack is very good. The voice acting is also very well done. There are lots of different things to unlock in this game, from secret characters and stages to even special mini games like King of the Hill, Keep Away, and Digi-Race. There are even lots of items which spawn during the game. Lots are similar to Smash Bros., but there are some unique ones like Sympathy Pains, Digivolve everyone, and Piñata Party. There is even a story mode for players to go through. I think it would be awesome if this game got achievements. If you’re someone who likes Smash Bros. and/or <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/3225">Digimon</a>, you will really like this game.</p>

<p>If you know this game, you know why I’m writing this. Look it up if you want, but in summary, it’s a roguelike with multiple classes, no party members, a good amount of RNG, and 5 dungeons: 3 for the story mode, plus 1000 and 10000 floor dungeons as post-game.</p>

<p>It’s considered one of the worst RPGs in the world. There isn’t a story I think, or at least a very simple one. There also isn’t that much variety in items or enemies, so the last dungeons will be quite boring. Oh, I almost forgot - to save your game you need to find some statue in the tower, and these statues are also random. If you die, you have to start all over again.</p>

<p>In short, very fun game, 10/10, need more floors, and a subset for beating at least the post-game dungeons with all classes.</p>
