<p>Developed by Gremlin Interactive, and published by Interplay, Loaded is a top-down shooter that plays like a mix of <em>Gauntlet</em> and <em>Total Carnage</em>. Released in December of 1995, it is a very bloody game for its time. With 6 different characters to choose from each with different playstyles, it doesn’t feel too repetitive.</p>

<p>The controls feel great, gameplay is smooth, and the music is really good too if you like the genres of hard rock and upbeat techno/electronic music. Levels do not feel like they take forever to do. They are maze-like and backtracking isn’t so bad when you see spots of blood on the floor.</p>

<p>This game had a <a href="https://mybargaincomics.com/promo-comics/loaded-do-not-watermark.jpg">promotional comic</a>, which was designed by the comic book artist Garth Ennis, who helped create and design the game characters.</p>

<p>Some achievements examples could be: collecting all health packs in a level, clearing all enemies, and timed level completion.</p>

<p>Not a lot of people talk about this game, and fans who enjoy this type of genre should definitely try it out. This game was also released on the Sega Saturn but the PlayStation version is superior.</p>

<p>Astal is one of the best examples of the Saturn’s unrealized potential: the hand-drawn graphics look great on the system. The game itself is a 2D platformer with punching and throwing mechanics — think a more muscular Klonoa. I don’t know if it’s quite a forgotten classic, but it definitely deserves more attention that it gets. And it’s undoubtedly better than Bug!.</p>

<p>JOOOOOOOOOJO! One of the most well-known anime series has received many game adaptations in its time, as well as on the Sega Dreamcast!</p>

<p>This is actually 2 different versions of this game packed into one: JoJo’s Venture and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future. Both are fighting games, similar in style to titles like Street Fighter III.</p>

<p>The story mode loosely follows the plot of the manga, specifically Part 3, with Jotaro and crew journeying to find and defeat Dio. During combat you are able to summon your stand, which essentially gives a character a second moveset. This makes fights more intense and exciting, turning your stand on/off to perform different combos and moves feels very satisfying. There are a few unlockable characters that switch up the way stands are used, such as Khan and Rubber Soul.</p>

<p>This is considered by many to be the best JoJo video game, on whatever platform you play it on, and Dreamcast, in my opinion, is one of the best. Can’t wait to see how the set will look.</p>

<p>It’s a unique take on Mario Kart where red bells are various items and the blue bells are speed up items. The characters are quirky. You can spend coins you get from the track in a shop. You can jump and brake, and depending on the character the player controls, he or she may try to cause another player to spin-out. It sounds like a cute and fun game to have a set. It’s good for a free point set. :) The backgrounds and tracks are vibrant as well. This game/gem is underrated. I want it to receive some love.</p>

<p>Rockman 7 EP is the only full Mega Man 7 romhack, and fortunately it’s a very good one! it was made by Puresabe, the creator of Rockman 4: Minus Infinity, so you can already expect it to be a high quality hack. It includes new weapons, level design redone from scratch, bosses with completely new patterns, new gimmicks, references to other games (like Castlevania and Donkey Kong Country 2), and many other things. It’s a completely different game compared to the original and I highly recommend it to any Classic Mega Man fan.</p>

<p>Blue Stinger is a game that has been on my “I need to play this someday” list since I heard about it around 2010 or so. Unfortunately, although I’ve seen a bit of gameplay and found a disc, I’ve never had the chance to try it myself because, like many of my old machines, my Dreamcast stopped thinking before I hunted it down.</p>

<p>I hear it takes place around Christmas, and gameplay is reminiscent of Die Hard Arcade crossed with Resident Evil. I hear there’s aliens. I hear it had some weird concepts, but fell under the radar just like so many interesting Dreamcast titles. I’ve heard a lot of things about Blue Stinger. A RetroAchievements set would let me transition to knowing these things. Sometimes, the games everyone knows about are the best candidates for sets. Other times, the weird obscurities fit the bill; maybe not as many people will seek out and join the site because they were motivated by hunting down such titles, but I believe these sets are what keep people who have gone through everything they knew they wanted to stay in the community and try something new. Here’s hoping someday someone will put in the effort to elevate this allegedly-underrated gem, so I can know how shiny (or rough) it really is myself.</p>

<p>Eliminator Boat Duel is a duel racing game. It’s very well done. It has a side view on start/finish with really big sprites for NES, as well as top-down and 3rd person view during the race itself (all that during a single race). You race against the computer and can have 5 to 8 rivals depending on skill level. You can also play in 2 player mode versus your friend. You earn money by winning as many track sections as you can, completing races under certain times, collecting “$” items, and sinking your rivals. Upgrades are available in the shop to make your boat move or accelerate faster, steer smoother, or have stronger hull protecting from some damage.</p>

<p>It’s not a regular race, however. You can deal damage to your rival by jumping on his boat. Any boat can take 5 hits. If it has upgraded parts, it will still be in the game. Any hit after that will destroy 1 unit of your boat upgrade. If the boat has no upgrades and already took 5 units of damage, then it’ll sink after getting another hit. That’s why there is “Eliminator” in the name. If your hull is upgraded, there is a chance of getting hit but taking no damage. The higher this upgrade, the higher the chance. Your rival is not the only source of damage, though; there are hazardous objects like logs, alligators, and horns. A damaged boat also moves a bit more slowly.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each race there is a girl with a flag who gives the signal to start. When she waves the flag, the race begins. If you start too early, you receive a fine, deducted from your final winnings after the race. If you get out of bounds of the main track during the top-down sections, you’ll get some boost and be returned to the course, but will be fined for that as well.</p>

<p>Upgrading the engine increases your max speed, while upgrading acceleration lowers the time you need to reach the max speed. It also gives you advance on the start and more chance to win the first section. Steering upgrades affect your side moving speed in 3rd person view sections and turning speed in top-down view sections. If you take damage after taking the 5 hits, the first thing that starts to break is the hull, followed by steering, turbo acceleration, and finally engine.</p>

<p>There is a nitro system present. “N” items are scattered around the track, each one giving 2 nitroes. “N” items have fixed positions in top-down view sections, but are random in 3rd person view ones. Every player can collect up to 9. Press the B button to get the instant speed boost, which can prolonged if you hit non-hazardous object likes trampolines or buoys while being boosted.</p>

<p>Many of our players had this game in childhood and it’s really anticipated here, but I understand why there is no set yet. It’s hard to make something except progression and standard “max everything” (nitro, cash, wins, boat upgrades) without dozens of playing hours to test everything and invent something interesting.</p>

<p>Torneko no Daibouken (Taloon’s Great Adventure) is the grand daddy of the Mystery Dungeon series. In it you take the role of Torneko Taloon, the jolly shopkeeper from Dragon Quest 4, as he explores a mysterious and constantly-shifting dungeon in search of treasure to support his family. Combat and movement both take place in a top-down view, where every time you move or attack, so too do the monsters. Resources are limited and Taloon is more of a lover then a fighter, so every encounter is dangerous. Failure results in losing your treasure and even your EXP, so you need to carefully consider whether every Slime you encounter is worth punching.</p>

<p>RA is full of Pokemon fans, with the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon sets racking up tons of players. The entire Mystery Dungeon series owes its existence to this game’s success (In Japan, at least), which is why I think everyone should pay respect, and it deserves a set.</p>
