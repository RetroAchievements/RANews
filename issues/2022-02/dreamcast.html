<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>You asked, we delivered - the sixth generation of home consoles is finally coming to RetroAchievements with the debut of the Sega Dreamcast! Achievement sets will be released to the public very, very soon; it may even be out already by the time you read this!</p>

<p>We at the RANews team would like to extend our deepest appreciation to the many developers who have contributed to one of the most anticipated new console releases in RetroAchievements history. We also owe a great debt of gratitude to everyone hard at work on the <a href="https://www.libretro.com/">Libretro Project</a>, without whom none of this would be possible.</p>

<p>Although the Dreamcast could not compete with the sales juggernaut that was the PlayStation 2 and ultimately ended up being Sega’s final console, it certainly went out with a bang. As you read through this article, you may notice repetition of words and phrases such as “unique”, “one of a kind”, and “unlike anything else”. This is not hyperbole, but rather speaks to the true nature of the Dreamcast’s library. A staggering number of these games initially sold poorly as a result of their experimental design, before going on to become cult classics years later. If this is your first exposure to the Dreamcast, we encourage you to delve into these games with a sense of curiosity and open-mindedness.</p>

<p>Without further ado, now presenting the RetroAchievements Dreamcast launch window lineup! Some of these sets are still in development, but many have already been completed; keep your eyes peeled for the “Available At Dreamcast Launch” tag. Enjoy!</p>

  <p>Unlike the other racing games found on this list, Sega GT takes more of a simulation approach. There are tons of cars available, as well as extensive customization options to tailor your experience just how you like it. If you enjoy games like Gran Turismo, then this will be right up your alley.</p>

  <p>This is a 1v1 competitive falling block puzzle game featuring chibi renditions of Capcom characters from the Street Fighter and Darkstalkers series. It’s all about thinking ahead and planning out elaborate combos in order to overwhelm your opponent. The “Matching Service” in the title refers to the online mode that was once available, a prime example of how the Dreamcast was ahead of its time.</p>

  <p>Have you ever gotten so mad at your opponent during a fighting game that you wanted to pick something up and throw it at them? If so, have we got a game for you! Power Stone mixes all the best elements of 3-D fighters and Beat ‘em Ups to create an experience that is like no other. Nearly everything in the arena can be picked up and used as a weapon, powerful weapons that range from lead pipes to rocket launchers drop during the fight, and all of this happens as each fighter tries to capture three Power Stones which allows the fighter to turn into a nearly unstoppable version of themselves.</p>

  <p>Sonic Adventure is the first true 3D Sonic game and the highest selling Dreamcast game. A radical departure from its predecessors, Sonic Adventure features six playable characters, each with their own story campaign, and many different styles of gameplay. Level designs range from linear to exploratory to…fishing-based? The fan favorite Chao Garden makes its debut here, a pet raising and racing game-within-a-game with surprising depth. Completionists will have plenty to keep them busy in this massive game, undoubtedly one of the greatest the Dreamcast has to offer.</p>

  <p>If there were ever a game that both served as a game as well as a snapshot of the cultural zeitgeist at the time, Crazy Taxi is certainly it! This arcade racer is a near perfect port to the Sega Dreamcast. Your objective is to pick up customers in your taxi and get them to their destination as quickly as possible. The faster you get them there, the more money (and time in Arcade Mode) you’ll receive. The game might best be remembered for its soundtrack, including the Offspring and Bad Religion, and it’s customers destinations which include, Pizza Hut, Tower Records, Kentucky Fried Chicken and many more.</p>

  <p>Ok, so you are playing a bullet hell shmup, standard fare in gaming. But instead of a ship, you control a flying robot girl with a spear she can impale enemies with. When she uses this she can then chuck those enemies into the other enemies. Sure, she can fire normal bullets too, but the heart of this game’s fun is using your enemies as bowling balls!</p>

The game has three game modes. TriIcelon is your classic circuit racing mode that has 20 races spread over 4 different courses. Time Trial is where you can practice the courses and try and set personal records. Where the game really shines is in the VsIcelon mode, where you can play multiplayer with up to 4 players. The game’s appeal lies in its simplicity. With very few controls needed to play the game, practically anyone can pick up and join in on the fun!</p>

  <p>It’s impossible to concisely convey what makes Shenmue so special, but you’ve no doubt heard of it from its dedicated fanbase. It’s part murder mystery, part fighting game, part minigame compilation, part job simulator, and that’s only scratching the surface. It’s a slow-paced game with an intricately constructed world, thanks largely to how so much revolves around the in-game clock.

  <p>Ikaruga is a shmup unlike any other, and perhaps one of the greatest in its genre. Enemy bullets come in two distinct colors, and the player can swap between two states whenever they want to become immune to one but susceptible to the other. This mechanic can be used offensively as well, absorbing bullets of the same color to store power and shooting at ships of the opposite color for double damage. Ikaruga is a must-play for anyone looking to take on a notoriously difficult challenge.</p>

  <p>Bugs, Daffy, and friends take to the Dreamcast in this kart racer. From the roster to the voice acting to the track designs, the Looney Tunes theming is incredibly well-implemented here. This is a strong contender for the best Mario Kart alternative on the system, and should not be dismissed based on the reputation of licensed games.</p>

The gameplay has been heavily revamped as well, with teams of 3 being the new standard and a more beginner-friendly control scheme. With a whopping 56 characters to choose from, it’s easy to see why this game is so beloved.</p>

  <p>Sonic Adventure 2 effectively builds upon the foundation established by the first game. Story campaigns are split into “good” and “evil” halves this time, featuring six playable characters and plenty of varied gameplay styles. Fan favorite characters Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat make their debut here. The ranking system is introduced here as well, adding extra incentive for completionists to perfect each stage. The graphics are improved, the soundtrack is still incredible, and you can even raise Chao once again. Sonic Adventure 2 is without a doubt one of the most memorable Dreamcast games.</p>

The cel-shaded visuals further enhance the game’s unique vibe, and have aged tremendously well. Jet Set Radio is one of those games that encapsulates everything that makes the Dreamcast great.</p>

Each fish you catch adds more time to your timer and the bigger the catch, the bigger the time bonus! Original Mode has you competing in fishing tournaments to see who can catch the most fish in total weight. Lastly, there is a Practice Mode you can utilize to help you learn how to get the biggest catches. So, what are you waiting for? Get out on the lake and start casting!</p>

  <p>Typing of the Dead revisits the plot of The House of the Dead 2 with an unexpected twist.

The changes made to the presentation transform what could once be described as horror into more of a comedy. Multiple paths and endings are available once again, adding some variety to subsequent playthroughs. The difficulty is adaptive as well, becoming easier or harder based on the player’s performance. Typing of the Dead is an utterly bizarre game that deserves to be experienced for the novelty factor alone.</p>
