<h2 id="2-introduction">2) Introduction</h2>

<p>Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves is an action/RPG/adventure game for the NES released back in 1991. The game is based off the 1991 movie. Overall the game is a fun adventure with various types of gameplay. The gameplay is mostly a top down action adventure however will occasionally change one on one duels, to large battle fields where all the characters are fighting many enemies and then two sections of a side scrolling when you’re riding a horse. The game also involves you being able to equip your character to be able to have a few attack styles or weapon styles ranging from ranged combat, fast or slow strong attacking.</p>

<h2 id="3-walkthrough">3) Walkthrough</h2>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>

<p>The first step is the play the game. Playing through the game will earn you most of your achievements as many of them are story related. Doing this step of just playing the game will unlock the following achievements:</p>

<p><a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38343">Prison Break</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38344">Welcome Home?</a><br />

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38350">Magical Dagger</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38342">Robin Hood and His Merry Men</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38351">Master of Fighting</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38352">Mystical Water</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38353">To War!</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38354">To The Town</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38355">Storm The Castle!</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38356">Happily Ever After</a></p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

<p>Pretty much the clean-up, some of these you should have gotten just from normal play. You should be able to gain one level; in fact, I don’t think it is possible to complete the game without gaining at least one. Now, if you have missed some achievements thus far, you can grind the rest out in the last castle. So, before completing the game, you should grind out these last few achievements:</p>

<p><a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38333">Got a Good Supply</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38334">Why use the bow?</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38335">Should be enough to pay taxes</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38336">Wait, shouldn’t this be given to the poor?</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38337">I feel a little stronger</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38338">Powering Up</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38339">I am Robin Hood!</a><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38340">Carrying a Burden</a> <strong>-=Missable=-</strong><br />
<a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38341">Gotta go fast</a></p>

<p>Upon the last dungeon, you should be able to get the rest of these if you never got them during normal play. <strong>However, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/38340">Carrying a Burden</a> is potentially missable at this point depending on how much stuff you dropped when you got to town.</strong> This normally shouldn’t be a problem but if you dropped too much, you may not be able to get enough supplies to be able to increase your load large enough to meet the conditions of this achievement.</p>

      <td>Have 500 arrows on hand.</td>
    </tr>

<p>This is a pretty simple achievement to get, a little grindy. Arrows can be found all over the place but your constant supply will come from soldiers. This does get harder as you progress though the game and later on the soldiers themselves get a bow so it is easier to grind this early on than later. <strong>I found the best place was the path after Locksley Castle.</strong> You have a constant supply of soldiers and once you get the achievement, you do not need to horde arrows making it easier to kill enemies later. This can also be used to grind levels however there is a better method to grind levels which I will explain later.</p>

      <td>Acquire 500 gold.</td>
    </tr>

<p>This is very similar to the arrows achievements, kill the soldiers and they will drop gold. There is also a mission where you will be given gold to hire a fighting instructor which will be a great help however, at the end of the mission, you will lose the gold so try and get these achievements before you spend the gold on the instructor.</p>

      <td>Gain a level.</td>
    </tr>

<p>This one is simple, just kill some enemies and you’ll eventually gain a level (100 EXP). You will usually get this sometime in the sewers or when you get to Hadrian’s Wall.</p>

      <td>Get Robin to Level 4.</td>

<p>Just keep killing things and you’ll eventually get to level 4.</p>

      <td>Get Robin to Max Level.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This one can be a bit of a grind. You can keep killing enemies and you will eventually get this however, there is a much easier way that is less grinding. On the mission where you are fighting the boar, if you equip the staff you get when Little John joins your party, you can just hold the attack button down and the staff will always spin. When the boar charges down, it will run into you and with you spinning the staff, it will be killed very, very quickly. When the boar begins to explode, you will see you gained your EXP and if you leave before the boar finishes blowing up, you can re-enter and the boar will be alive again. You do this again and just repeat until you are max level. It is still grindy but it is much faster than killing regular soldier.</p>

      <td>Have someone carry a load of 100 or more and look at their page.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>-=MISSABLE=-</strong></p>

<p>This one isn’t too hard to do, it is better when you are max level and later in the game when you have many items in your inventory. What you need to do is take one character and get them to hold the heaviest things you can, chain mail, leather, sword, etc. Just load it all on and this one should pop. You will be able to see how much items increase the weight when you put it on them.</p>
