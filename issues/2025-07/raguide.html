<h1 id="2-introduction">2) Introduction</h1>

<p>Dragon Quest, titled Dragon Warrior when initially localized to North America, is a role-playing video game developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was originally released in Japan in 1986 and by Nintendo in North America in 1989. It is the first game in the Dragon Quest video game series. The player controls the hero character who is charged with saving the Kingdom of Alefgard and rescuing its princess from the evil Dragonlord.</p>

<p>Dragon Warrior’s set was developer by SirVG, who made sure that all parts of the game are covered, from progression to leveling and monster slaying, and even an optional rate items you would normally not ever need. While it is by no means a difficult set, it is one that will require a lot of grinding, so expect most of your playthrough to be on fast forward.</p>

<h1 id="3-walkthrough">3) Walkthrough</h1>

<p><a href="#step-1-story-achievements--total-points-185"><strong>Step 1: Story Achievements (3 missable)</strong></a></p>

<p>There are all the achievements necessary to defeat the final boss of the game and claim the game as beaten. This guide is setup in a way that you should at no point need another guide, with the map being shown in part 4 of the guide, and directions given with each achievement.</p>

<p><strong>The only thing you need to keep in mind is to not rescue the princess when you get the chance to, as you need to beat the final boss once without having rescued her. Once you are ready to approach the final boss for the first time, save the game (optionally make a copy with the in-game feature if you want to be extra safe) and defeat him. After the credits roll and you reboot the game, you can then rescue the princess and go through the process again for the other missable achievements.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/13419">Thou Art a Jerk to Women</a> - Beat the game without having rescued the Princess.</li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/13418">Thine Princess By Thine Side</a> - Go through the final dungeon with the Princess.</li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/13420">Thou Hast Triumphed Together</a> - Follow-up achievement on the one above.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><a href="#step-2-miscellaneous-achievements--total-points-135"><strong>Step 2: Miscellaneous Achievements</strong></a></p>

<p>This step is for all the other achievements, generally sorted in a chronological way of how and when to get them. Doing these while alternating between the story achievements is highly recommended to ease up on the grind.</p>

      <td>Use the Magic Key and open the door to the King’s Chamber</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>This is the first achievement you will unlock in the game. In the king’s chamber, search every chest and find the Magic Key. Approach the door south of the king, press A and select the Door option to unlock the door.</p>

      <td>Find Erdrick’s Tablet</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Erdrick’s Tablet can be found in a cave north-west on Tantegel. This cave is devoid of monsters, but as with every cave, it is dark so a torch is recommended to make progress. Head down to the second floor and you will find Erdrick’s Tablet in the only chest.</p>

      <td>Find the Silver Harp</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Head to Garinham once you have at least two Magic Keys (you can purchase them in Rimuldar), and one or two torches unless you have the Illuminate spell. Strong gear (the best you can get in Rimuldar should suffice) and a level higher than 10 is strongly recommended. Open the house north and go inside, then hug the north black wall until you find the spot that lets you through a passage into Garin’s Grave. This is a cave consisting of four floors, and the Silver Harp is, unsurprisingly, at the very end. This cave also has the Cursed Belt for another achievement. It’s a dungeon with multiple dead ends, so if you want the quickest route to just the Silver Harp, what you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On B1F,  open the door on the right, then make your way to the middle of the screen where the only staircase is.</li>
  <li>On B2F, make your way to the bottom-left of the screen.</li>
  <li>On B3F, go north from where you currently are, which will eventually make you end up at the singular staircase.</li>
  <li>On B4F, take the other singular staircase in the middle, then you will arrive at the Silver Harp.</li>
</ul>

      <td>Find the Stones of Sunlight</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>One Magic Key (you can purchase them in Rimuldar) is required to get the Stones of Sunlight. Once you have the key, head back to Tantegel Castle and go to the top-right, where you will be blocked by a door. Open this door, then go outside when you are given the option to. Walk downwards alongside the castle wall, then go one space to the right and go downwards along the water to reach a staircase. Here you will find the Stones of Sunlight.</p>

      <td>Find the Staff of Rain</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The Silver Harp is required to get the Staff of Rain. Once you have this, head to Kol and then go west and up until you reach a shrine with an old man inside. Give him the Silver Harp, and the Staff of Rain is yours.</p>

<p>If you have the Princess’ Pledge, you can call to her to find the location, which is “70 steps south, and 40 steps east” on Tantegel. You will most likely not have this if you are going for all the endings, so instead, go to the swamp south of Cantlin (you need to walk around from west). On the right side of this swamp, search for Erdrick’s Token pretty much straight in the middle. Walk around here a bit and you will eventually find it. If you are not in a rush, you can wait until after you have Erdrick’s Armour to prevent damage taken in the swamp.</p>

      <td>Defeat the Dragonlord!</td>

  </tbody>

<p>The Dragonlord is the final- and toughest boss of the game, so being at the very least level 20 is recommended. If you’re going for mastery you need to be level 30 so you can also wait until then. With the best armour and sword, just hack in on him and heal when necessary. The Dragonlord has two phases, with the first one being a mage with low defense and HP so just get rid of him as quickly as possible. The second phase is stronger but still not really that bad depending on your level.</p>

  </tbody>

<p>To rescue the Princess, you will need a Magic Key, a torch or Illuminate magic, and a level of around 15 is also recommended as you need to defeat a Green Dragon (but given that you will likely do this with the endings, you will be fine). Once you have all the requirements, go south of Kol into the cave connecting to the continent with Rimuldar. On the right side in this cave you will run into the dragon that appears as a random encounter, so defeat it and then open the door to find the Princess.</p>

<p>Over the course of the game, you will very likely end up at Level 19 at the very least before you attempt to beat the final boss, unless you are a speedrunner or someone who enjoys suffering through the final dungeon underpowered. Anything beyond on the other hand is a serious grind, so it is highly recommended to get familiar with emulator functions like fast forward and the turbo buttons. Turbo A will keep you going during battles, and Turbo B will ensure the menu won’t be opened while fastforwarding on the overworld.</p>

<p>Here are the general recommendations for each milestone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 2 and 3: just run outside Tantegel and defeat Slimes and Drakees. Recommended is to keep this up to around level 5 while stocking up on gear/armor Tantegel Town.</li>
  <li>Level 9: Make your way north-west of Tantegel to Garinham. Buy the best armour you can, then grind around here for a bit or to the south where a cave is, where you can get an item for another achievement. May as well kill two birds with one stone to make the grind not painful. This cave is recommended to do until level 9. If you have money to burn (3,000 gold to be exact), you can also go to the far east of Garinham to Kol, which has better armour.</li>
  <li>Level 12: For this one, you want to farm south of Rimuldar, which is to the south of Kol through a cave under water. To the south of Rimuldar are not only good enemies like the Wyvern, but also the Goldman who drops more gold than any other enemy. Unsurprisingly, it is recommended to farm this enemy for a while because the better you armour, the easier you can grind. Buy the best armour in Rimuldar during this grind and stock up on some additional money; the next upgrades in armour are fairly expensive.</li>
  <li>Level 15: You can either decide to stay at the Goldmans for a bit longer, or instead do some more mandatory quests, like getting the Silver Harp and Cursed Belt. The Grave of Garin also is a pretty good grinding spot for around your level, so I would personally recommend it. If you are tired of grinding at the same spot, you can go to the south-west of the map, though do beware that enemies are significantly stronger here. If you want, you can try to push through to Cantlin, the fortress city, and see if you have enough money to upgrade you armour; 9,800 gold is needed for the sword, and 14,800 for the shield.</li>
  <li>Level 19: If you haven’t done any previous mandatory quests yet, do them now. If not, grind outside Cantlin or inside Hauksness if you are strong enough. Hauksness is also where you can get Erdrick’s Armour, so getting this as soon as possible is recommended.</li>
</ul>

<p>(You no longer need to be level 30 for the achievement, as this has been demoted as Unwelcome Concept. However, I have left it here in case you do want to grind some more before facing the final boss.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 30: The big grind. First of all, it is highly recommended to have done everything you can at this point, including getting all of Erdrick’s gear (the sword is in Charlock Castle) and possibly also the Death Necklace as you will be going down the dungeon several times for it anyway. Once you got everything, your best grinding spot until the very end of the game will be Hauksness. Just run inside with the before-mentioned emulator functions, keep defeating enemies, and heal when necessary.
    <ul>
      <li>Alternative 1: Once you are Level 24, you can one-shot Metal Slimes to the south-west of Hauksness. I generally don’t recommend this as they are rare encounters and don’t offer that much more exp, but if you are tired of the same environment you can at least mix it up.</li>
      <li>Alternative 2: The lower floors of Charlock Castle will provide you with more exp/h, but also features significantly stronger enemies so you are likely to need healing more often. If that is worth the trade-off for you, it’s a good option.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  </tbody>

<p>The Fighter’s Ring is located on the lowest floor in the Mountain Cave south of Garinham. A level of 7 is recommended at the very least. To get as quick as possible to this chest, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>B1F: Go up and to the north-west to find a staircase. Don’t go down here, and instead go to the right, then the first path down and follow the path to the staircase.</li>
  <li>B2F: Go up as soon as you can, then continue the path to the left and you will find two chests at the end, with one containing the Fighter’s Ring.</li>

      <td>Find the Death Necklace</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The Death Necklace is also located on the lowest floor in the Mountain Cave south of Garinham, but there is a catch: this one appears randomly in a chest. You will have to go down to the chest and then out of the dungeon again multiple times to get this item. Recommended is to wait with getting this item until you are a very high level, as well as having enough magic to teleport yourself out of the dungeon whenever you reach the bottom. This item will not benefit you in any way, so you can just do it whenever you want, ideally during a grind to save time.</p>

<p>To get as quick as possible to this chest, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>B1F: Go up and to the north-west to find a staircase. Don’t go down here, and instead go to the right, then the first path down and follow the path to the staircase.</li>
  <li>B2F: Go down as soon as you can and make your way to the very south-west of the map, then up until you see a singular chest. This is the one that will either have ~100 gold, or the necklace.</li>

      <td>Find the Fairy Flute</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>An NPC in Rimuldar will tell you about the location, but you don’t need to talk to him to find this item. What you need to do is go to Kol and walk up to the open air bath. Stand to the south of it, walk four squares south, and search. You will there find the Fairy Flute.</p>

      <td>Find the Cursed Belt</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The Cursed Belt is in Garin’s Grave, on the bottom floor, which is the same dungeon as where you get the Silver Harp so tackling these both at once is recommended. A level of 13 is recommended at the very least. You will also need two Magic Keys and a torch or two or the Illuminate spell.</p>

<p>To get as quick as possible to this chest, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>B1F:  Open the door on the right, then make your way to the middle of the screen where the only staircase is.</li>
  <li>B2F: Take either the staircase located in the north-west, or in the south-east.</li>
  <li>B3F: Make your way to the north-west of this map, where you will find a chest with the Cursed Belt.</li>

      <td>Find the Silver Shield</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Although this achievement says to find the Silver Shield, what you need to do is buy it for 14,800 gold in Cantlin. You will very likely get this just by upgrading your armour over the course of the game, unless you are a sadist.</p>

      <td>Find Erdrick’s Armor</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This armour is located is Hauksness. In this destroyed city, you want to get to the square with trees that is to the right of two swamp tiles, on the right side of the city. You know you will be at the correct square when you are attacked by an Axe Knight defending it. This is a fairly strong enemy, so be prepared and have a level of around 17 when you attempt this. Once the Axe Knight is dead, search the square and you will find Erdrick’s Armour.</p>

      <td>Find Erdrick’s Sword</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Erdrick’s Sword is located in Charlock Castle, the final dungeon. Before you go here, you need to have finished building the Rainbow Bridge, and be at a level of around 18 or higher. This dungeon is a little complicated, so what you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0F: Find the staircase behind the throne and go down.</li>
  <li>B1F/B2F: Follow these paths until the end, there is only one staircase to take for both.</li>
  <li>B3F: Take the first path to the left, then up and keep following the path until the next shortcut.</li>
  <li>B4F: Make your way to the top right of the map, then stand left of the staircase and go down.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have taken this staircase, just keep following the paths until you inevitably arrive at Erdrick’s Sword.</p>

      <td>Defeat the trademark Blue Slime!</td>

<p>This enemy roams around Tantegel and is pretty much required to level up. Just defeat one and the achievement is yours.</p>

      <td>Defeat the Goldman (and get rich)!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This enemy is located only south of Rimuldar, near the shrine and slightly above of it. Keep running around here until you find one… and stay here for a while because it’s good money.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a class="gameicon-link" href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/13401" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img class="gameicon" src="https://retroachievements.org/Badge/13199.png" /> <span>Thou Hast Defeated the Y BURN</span></a></td>
      <td>Defeat the wyvern!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You will encounter the Wyvern at the same location as the Goldman, south of Rimuldar. If by some miracle you don’t come across it, it also roams outside of Hauksness.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a class="gameicon-link" href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/13399" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img class="gameicon" src="https://retroachievements.org/Badge/13197.png" /> <span>Thou Hast Defeated the Metal Slime</span></a></td>
      <td>Defeat the evasive Metal Slime!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The Metal Slime is located south-west of Hauksness, and is a tough enemy to kill thanks to its high defense and tendency to run away. You can either just keep running around there and hope you end up lucky, or wait until level 24 where it will be a guaranteed one-shot.</p>
