<p>Dr. Raichi is from the race of the Tuffles and a survivor of the Planet Plant, which was later called Planet Vegeta, as the Saiyans destroyed almost all the Tuffles on this planet. Raichi escaped to the Dark Planet, which lies in the darkest place at the end of the universe. Now he has only one goal in mind: To eradicate the remaining Saiyans.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Z Gaiden: Saiya Jin Zetsumetsu Keikaku is a side story that timeline-wise plays around the time of the 10 day wait towards the Cell games, but is considered non-canon in the Dragon Ball storyline. As some of the other earlier and also later <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/5787">Dragon Ball Z</a> RPG titles, the fights are played in the form of a card game. You can choose between Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Future Trunks.</p>

<p>There was quite a big promotion for this late Famicom game, as around the same time there was a 2 part OVA made, which came out in the West as “Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans” that follows the plot of the game itself. This was also remade in 2010, as the main villain of Z Gaiden would become a character in Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2.</p>

<p>As a big Dragon Ball fan, I am always curious about any sort of media involving the series and especially video games. Dragon Ball Z Gaiden is one of the most unique games in the series in my opinion, and it deserves a decent set.</p>

<p>Yes, this game has great mechanics, a fair difficulty, and hilarious commercials in its episodic anime-style structure, but it is the soundtrack that makes Geppy-X deserving of achievements. It might be the best soundtrack on the PlayStation 1. An achievement set would give players the perfect excuse to experience this soundtrack in full.</p>

<p>Outside of jamming to the soundtrack, you get a parody of the Super Robot genre. Each part of the game opens with an anime intro, a cutscene, a side-scrolling level, a commercial break, another side-scrolling level, and finally an anime outro. You can transform your Super Robot into three different forms to tackle various challenges, and later, you receive a full upgrade to your mecha. It’s a beautiful game from start to finish, packed with love for the Super Robot genre.</p>

<p>While the gameplay and presentation already make Geppy-X worth playing, its music makes it unforgettable. If there’s any PlayStation game that deserves achievements just for the soundtrack, this is the one.</p>

<p>Have you ever tried a game that is just…so out there that you just had to give it a try? Maybe it’s the concept. Perhaps it’s the art style. Or it possibly could do with the gameplay. As a title that certainly almost no one has ever heard of before, I can guarantee that Prey the Stars: Gabu Gabu Planet gives you a little bit of all three.</p>

<p>You control one of four monsters with only one simple goal in mind: eat absolutely everything, and do it faster than any of your opponents. Sounds simple, yes? Well, this is no <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/8543">Pac-Man</a>, lemme tell you. Everything has to be eaten one at a time with a short and simple button mashing minigame (though sometimes you need to time out other actions as well such as licking or sucking), and every item in the game is unique in both size and property. And this is important, as not only do you need to eat enough small things to become big enough to eat the larger items, but eating multiple items with the same property gives special bonuses to help you eat better, as well as giving you access to power-ups which can be used to hinder your opponents, with a chance to transform into a special frenzy mode which allows you to consume everything in your path, including your rivals.</p>

<p>Along with this rather simple gameplay loop is an equally simple story campaign, which hardly takes itself seriously with a quirky tone found in other similarly stylized titles such as <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/8171">Katamari Damacy</a>. And as you progress through the game, you’ll start with things like produce and groceries and move up to appliances and buildings and eventually even stars and planets, eating everything in sight. And upon beating any level, you are gifted skins which are unlocked across every single monster and grant bonuses like extra power to your eating power, increase your affinity with certain elements, or even grant certain effects such as increasing your chances of getting better skins, which makes it hella replayable even long after you finish the campaign.</p>

<p>As a child, this was a very fun game to return to every now and again, and was a game I distinctly remember actually getting to the end of, which frankly was a rarity for me when I was younger. I hold fond memories of this game and feel wholly unique in that I have never heard a single other person ever playing this game, and yet it’s because of this fact that I yearn for this game to get achievements. More people need to know about this fun little experience, and if no one else is gonna bear the flag for it, I may as well. Also, did I mention this game has a multiplayer mode where you can battle up to four people to see who can eat the most things? Just a fun little nugget to throw out there on top of everything else.</p>

<p>Space Harrier is one of the most important games in <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/5666">Sega</a>’s history, and a landmark arcade title that has been ported to dozens of consoles and included in almost all of the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/25679">Yakuza</a> series games. Despite all that, it surprisingly doesn’t have a set on the website. Currently the best port that does is the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/10565">32X version</a>. It features an inconsistent framerate, making the game play harder than the original, and the ceiling stage is genuinely hard to look at since the checkered design takes up most of the screen. Other than that, it’s a classic and addicting arcade game with quick gameplay to keep you on your toes, impressive use of 3D, nice sprite work, and banging tunes that will get stuck in your head long after you’ve run out of quarters (looking at you bonus stage).</p>

<p>Jet Moto took advantage of the anti-grav racer trend during the 90s. Although more grounded than the more popular titles in the franchise like <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/252">F-Zero</a> and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/11378">Wipeout</a>, you still get a futuristic experience with gravity defying vehicles.</p>

<p>Graphically it isn’t the best, and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/10617">Wave Race 64</a> kills it in the water department. Still, there is a lot to love. The team that was hired to do the comic art knocked it out of the park. All of the racers have backstories and handle differently. Not to mention some of them get to sport sick Mountain Dew jackets. Of course I do the Dew, do you? The surf rock soundtrack is also top notch. It matches the vibes in the same way Wipeout’s techno beats do.</p>

<p>It can be a bit punishing on certain tracks, but if my old thumbs can do it, y’all can too. Racing and sports games on RA don’t seem to get enough love. I understand that it’s no <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/7221">Final Fantasy</a>, but I strongly suggest someone take up the task. I’ve even thrown up some suggestions in Discord, so it might save you 11 minutes!</p>

<p>While this unofficial(ish) port of Sonic Robo Blast 2 is currently just a demo with the first zone and some special stages (which aren’t even from the latest version, but to be fair this is the 32X), this port is AMAZING for 32X standards. It might even be one of the most impressive games on the ill-fated add-on, if not the most technically impressive already. So, for those who don’t know, SRB2 is one of the oldest Sonic fangames ever made (it was made all the way back in 1998!), which is still being developed to this day! I won’t go deep into the history of this wonderful fangame, as it will be mostly irrelevant to this topic, but the initial versions of this game were in 2D, just like its predecessor, although it would become 3D (as most people know SRB2 is) not long after those versions came out.</p>

<p>This port is based on the source code for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/18179">Doom 32X Resurrection</a>/CD32X Fusion, similar to how the PC game is based on the Doom Legacy engine, with additional modifications to, of course, be adapted to the Sonic gameplay we all know and love. This port has a surprisingly good frame rate most of the time, although there will definitely be slowdowns in more intense areas, but it shouldn’t be that big of an issue for the most part. If you have played the original game, however, you will notice some gameplay differences. For example, there are no ramps in the levels at all, and Sonic has a homing attack instead of the Thok (if you try to use it while there is nothing to “home” to, nothing will happen).</p>

<p>Also, Sonic is the ONLY playable character in this demo, but the others will probably come later in development. Whenever you get used to the controls, you’ll find out that this game is quite fun! It feels fast-paced (like most Sonic games should be), the level design is like something that Sonic Team would make, and there are plenty of hidden secrets in the levels! You’ll probably want to search for those Emerald Tokens, because they are well hidden… The zones in this game (or in the case of this demo, Greenflower Zone) have 3 acts, 2 “normal” acts and 1 “boss” act (similar to games like <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/10062">Sonic CD</a>). The boss of this zone is the classic Egg Mobile, which will try to attack you with a laser, and after 5 hits, he will attack with 3 lasers 3 times in a row.</p>

<p>Now, you may be asking, how exactly are the special stages not based on v2.1/2? Well, the ones from that version feature some <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/14527">NiGHTS</a>-style gameplay, which may or may not be too much for the 32X. However, the special stages from v2.0 ARE present instead, which are WAY more basic. Instead of flying, you just have your normal physics, but you still have to collect Blue Spheres to get a Chaos Emerald (although here, you have to collect ALL of them).</p>

<p>If you played the original game, you should definitely check out this port! (I hope it gets completed…)</p>

<p>When I think of this game, I think of those long hours spent running through the corridors of Hogwarts, searching for lost objects or recruiting students… Of those long moments spent facing Slytherins at chess or Gobstones. To the freedom I felt at the time when I went all around the castle on my broom…</p>

<p>At a time when a game like Hogwarts Legacy was a distant dream, Order of the Phoenix was the closest thing to it, fulfilling the dream of thousands of people: being able to explore Hogwarts in complete freedom. In addition, it is one of the only games in the license not to have a set. Please make one, he deserves it!</p>

<p>The “game-ification” of real-world sporting events is hardly an uncommon occurrence. Baseball games will often let you play your way through the World Series, association football games often headline the World Cup, and even two of the biggest faces in gaming, Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog, had a long history of attending the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/14812">Olympics</a> together. In contrast, one semi-overlooked corner of sports games is the rallying sub-genre of racing games, and one of its most significant real-world events is the Dakar Rally (formerly known as the Paris-Dakar Rally), originally named as such for its original start and end being in Paris, France and Dakar, Senegal, respectively. While there have been numerous video game adaptations of the Dakar Rally over the years, none reach the level of sheer absurdity that is achieved by Paris-Dakar Rally Special, a 1988 Famicom game by developer Intelligent System Corporation, or ISCO. If their name doesn’t ring a bell, they were eventually fortunate enough to co-develop the Sega Saturn survival horror Deep Fear, but they had gotten their start two years prior with <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/4105">The Transformers: Mystery of Convoy</a>, a debut release which should make their 14-year lifespan an achievement on its own.</p>

<p>From the beginning, Paris-Dakar Rally Special makes a brave deviation from other racing games by starting you not in the driver’s seat, but ambling on the streets of Japan in search of money from a sponsor so you can afford a car. However, once all of that is squared away (and after playing a bizarre reaction time-based minigame that determines your co-driver), the 7 areas that comprise the actual rally throw any realism that may have been set up by such a riveting prelude out the window - your first leg may feature some unusually aggressive competitors, but future events make this pale in comparison. Soon enough, you’ll find yourself dropping oil slicks to fend off enemy cars in a maze of Parisian buildings, meeting hostile sea life as you pilot your vehicle through the Mediterranean, and even shooting down tanks, fighter jets, and helicopters in the desert as your journey comes to a close. If, somehow, your first question is “where’s the original Paris-Dakar Rally if this game is ‘Special’?”, it’s because that title was originally taken by <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/2338">Victory Run</a> before the license fell through, though how this game managed to secure the Paris-Dakar Rally title instead is maybe an inquiry of greater validity.</p>

<p>Anyone willing to read this far about a Japan-exclusive, 37-year-old Famicom game is probably at least slightly aware of the Japanese term “kusoge”, or “crappy game”, but another term exists known as “bakage” or “stupid game”, meant for those games that are silly, crazy, or just plain bizarre, regardless of their actual quality. Paris-Dakar Rally Special easily ticks all the boxes, and the ridiculous extent it goes to in order to make one of the most grueling endurance events in the history of motorsport more “video game-like” make it worth a look for any NES-centric set developer. So get out there, drive safe, and most importantly, do your best - after all, you wouldn’t want to travel this far only to come home with nothing… would you?</p>

<p>Gather yourself a ship and a crew, and discover the New World during the mid and late 17th century, as a plundering pirate.</p>

<p>Sid Meier’s Pirates is the remake of one of <a href="https://retroachievements.org/hub/7334">Sid Meier</a>’s very first games he developed, even before he became world famous with his universally acclaimed Civilization series of strategy games. You can sail around a large map that covers all of the Spanish Main, which are the Caribbean islands, Central America, south of North America, and north of South America.</p>

<p>You can choose your own life as a pirate, and there is no right or wrong way to play this game. You can take up jobs from colonial governors to fight against other colonies, you can get yourself married with the daughter of a governor, you can plunder for treasure, rescue your family that where wrongfully taken from you as a child, etc.</p>

<p>When it comes to the greatest pirate games in history, people like to say Assassin’s Creed Black Flag or Sea of Thieves. And while I like these games too, my answer will always be Sid Meier’s Pirates. No game will ever come close to this pirate experience.</p>

<p>Do you want to play an Olympic themed game with babies in it? Now you can! It’s a compilation of track &amp; field games where you compete with another baby to be better than the rest! The controls are pretty easy to pick up and play, and maybe you can set the best record for that specific game.</p>

<p>Simple games are just hit and miss in my opinion, and this time around, they hit the mark for me. I’ve also played the game on the ported version which is “Come on Baby!” on Steam, and I would like to replay it all over again in RA. It’s such a charming, funny, and interesting game, and I think some people would find it worthwhile as well.</p>
