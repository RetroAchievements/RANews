<h1 id="game-introduction">Game Introduction</h1>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker is a fun romp across a flooded Hyrule. The graphics offer a more artistic/cartoony vibe making you feel like you are on a grand adventure. The game received mostly positive reviews, though some were not a fan of the sailing mechanic or the end game side quest. Those that have played <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/3154">Metroid Prime</a> will recognize some of the end bits.</p>

<p>The game has been remastered in <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/13243">an HD Release for the Wii U</a>. The vast majority of the game is the same, with the primary difference being a new item in the Swift Sail, some modified quests/rewards, and better Pictograph recognition. Should the Wii U get supported and Wind Waker HD get an achievement set, this guide should work well enough for that release.</p>

<h1 id="set-introduction">Set Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="gamecube">GameCube</h2>

<p>There are 126 achievements in Wind Waker. 21 of them are marked as missable, with one additional cheevo needing a missable mark. 28 are marked as progression. There’s only one win condition achievement to defeat Ganondorf.</p>

<h1 id="general-tips">General Tips</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Most enemies offer a tell when they will attack. If you have your sword out during this time, you will hear a panic sound and see the A button light up more than normal. Press the A button to parry/counter the attack and deliver a special blow that can damage or even one-shot certain enemies.</li>
  <li>There are many items to collect and passages to go through. Take down some notes, use a spreadsheet, or perhaps try using a Randomizer tracker to keep up with everything. While all of the collection cheevos will be marked, they only show how many of something you have, rather than what specific ones you have done.</li>
  <li>If going for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/438802">Glass Cannon</a>, you will realistically only have one heart piece to spare. One is required for a Triforce Piece, and a second will be delivered to you via mail just for story progression. Decide wisely which piece you take, if any.</li>
  <li>There is a New Game Plus of sorts in this game. Beat the game for the first time, and you can start a new game with the following changes:
    <ul>
      <li>All of the Hylian text you’ve seen spoken by Valoo, the Deku Tree, and Jabun will be translated into your local language.</li>
      <li>All of the figurines you made in the previous game will transfer over.</li>
      <li>As long as you collected the original Picto Box, you will start with the Deluxe Picto Box.</li>
      <li>Aryll will wear a pirate outfit throughout all of the game.</li>
      <li>Link will wear his pajamas the entire game. The hero’s clothes are…well, invisible in this game.</li>
      <li>The locations of deep sea treasures may change slightly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Note that if anything is missed in this New Game Plus, that is it. There is no third game to carry things over. Everything can be accomplished in the first game, though the second game is a good fallback.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="tingles-items">Tingle’s Items</h1>

<h2 id="the-tingle-tuner">The Tingle Tuner</h2>

<p>On rescuing Tingle in the GameCube version, you will receive the Tingle Tuner. This allows you to use the second controller slot with a Game Boy Advance and a Game Boy Advance to GameCube Link Cable to interact with Wind Waker in some unique ways. For those that seek a more digital approach, remember to dump your GBA bios file. The Tingle Tuner is required for some cheevos.</p>

<h2 id="the-tingle-bottle">The Tingle Bottle</h2>

<p>If on the Wii U version, you will receive the Tingle Bottle instead. This allows sending and receiving messages and pictographs through Miiverse. At least, it would if there was a solid connection to a working Miiverse server. As Nintendo’s Miiverse server is down, this item is functionally useless at this point.</p>

<p>The equivalent of <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/431156">Ignoramus Idolatry</a> can be achieved in the Wii U version. The treasure chests still exist. You just have to use regular bombs instead of Tingle Bombs.</p>

<h1 id="playthrough">Playthrough</h1>

<p>The playthrough below will focus on the minimum path required to finish the game, though a few side quests and key things may be mentioned early. The idea is to show one way of playing without needing much more than the minimum for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/438802">Glass Cannon</a>.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-a-taste-of-adventureand-stealth">Part 1: A Taste of Adventure…and Stealth</h2>

<p>Get through the intro cutscene, and save right away. There are some missables right off the bat, and you don’t want to deal with the three-four minutes of waiting.</p>

<p>Upon leaving your house, you’ll see Sue-Belle carrying a pot on her head. Use the other nearby pots and rocks and destroy the pot. Talk to Sue-Belle afterwards. If you earned Granny’s Stash from earlier (or picked up 10 rupees from other means), you’ll have enough for the fine.</p>

</table>

<p>There are three small pigs around Outset Island. You can pick them up by getting close, though it’s recommended to either lead them to water first, utilize all purpose bait (see below), or be very quiet while moving. This cheevo will pop when the third pig is standing up-right in the dedicated pig pen.</p>

<p>For those wondering why this cheevo is not listed first, there is an interesting characteristic with this cheevo. As long as no pigs are brought in to the pen, you are able to enter and exit any building you want to reset the pig’s positions. This can come in handy if you ever cause one pig to sink below the ground. Yes, this is a thing that can happen.</p>

<p>Testing has not been done to see if any pigs in their pen stay in their pen in the early game. This is why it’s recommended to save early.</p>

<p>Continue the story until you enter the woods above Outset. Put your sword away until two Bokoblins fall down. If your sword is still out when they fall and the cheevo icon is still active, get far away from the Bokoblins without leaving the area and put it away to be safe. The best thing to do is bait the Bokoblins into attacking you, and watch as Friendly Fire is turned on for you. If you are lucky, the two will somehow attack each other to finish themselves off. If you are not so lucky, there should be some rocks you can throw for the final hit.</p>

<p>Right in the water by Outset’s docks is Beedle’s Shop Ship. Beedle appears in a few different islands, but this is your first (and best) opportunity to get the Bait Bag. It only costs 20 rupees, which shouldn’t be an issue at this stage.</p>

<p><em>Complete Niko’s obstacle course within 20 seconds.</em></p>

<p>Save your game while on the ship, but ideally before talking with Niko. The good news is that you have as many attempts as you want: if the target time goes by, simply wait for the time to expire or hit the reset button early and you will get another chance.</p>

<p>The best tip is to go from rope to platform quickly. Upon grabbing a rope, you can hit the A button to immediately jump off.</p>

<p>There are four chests that count for this achievement: a map, compass, yellow rupee, and a piece of heart. Simply get them all and the cheevo is yours.</p>

<p>For those going for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/438802">Glass Cannon</a>, you will have to make a decision whether you want this to be the spare heart piece you want. If not, reset the game after earning this achievement.</p>

<p>Get your sword at the top of the Forsaken Fortress and meet up with the kidnapped maidens. Aryll is among them.</p>

<p>Bad news: you are caught by the Helmaroc King and cast aside to the ocean.</p>

<p>Good news: the King of Red Lions will rescue you. You have your new mission.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-are-we-learning-power-or-courage">Part 2: Are We Learning Power or Courage?</h2>

<p>If we are to rescue Aryll and the others, we must prepare for the journey. Of course, that starts with giving the King of Red Lions, a talking boat, a sail. Please don’t ask how he rescued you in the first place without one.</p>

<p>There are a few sidequests worth doing while you are here. One of them leads to actual story progression later on, so it’s worth taking this detour.</p>

<p>Start things off by going to the Windfall Jail. You’ll find Tingle inside the jail. Nearby should be a hidden switch: step on it. You’ll receive both the Tingle Tuner (Tingle Bottle in the Wii U version) and the special chart, Tingle’s Chart, from the recently freed fairy-man. Go into his jail and crawl through the maze successfully to get the Picto Box.</p>

<p>The Killer Bees are a group of four rambunctious kids that like to cause mischief. Of course, they will respect those who are better at them at games.

<ul>
  <li>One is on top of the tall tree by the Windfall docks. Roll into it.</li>
  <li>One is hiding in the back of the Bomb Shop. Sidle or Roll Jump to get to that area.</li>
  <li>One is hiding behind the grave that Tott is trying to dance by.</li>
  <li>One is hiding on a secluded platform close to the square.</li>
</ul>

<p>Spook the kids, then catch all of them. You’ll get a Piece of Heart for the trouble. You actually have to do this quest eventually because of some interactions with Mrs. Marie, so you may as well accept it.</p>

<p>Go to Zunari’s Shop (outdoors) and purchase the Sail Cloth for 80 rupees. You’ve done plenty so far for your first visit, but it makes more sense to come back later when you have more gear.</p>

<p>Komali will <em>maybe</em> consider giving up Din’s Pearl if you can somehow do something to help Valoo. At this point, chase after Melia who is in chaotic windy cavern. Wait for the wind to blow in a favorable direction and toss Medli to the other side of the broken bridge. She’ll give you a bottle for free.</p>

<p>Use that bottle to collect some water, and water the Bomb Flower plants. Break the rock, use some more Bomb Flowers, and enter Dragon Roost Cavern.</p>

<p>As you make your way across Dragon Roost Cavern, you’ll end up outside temporarily. Climb the tall ladder and you’ll see the gap in question. In order to get across without using the wooden planks or the Deku Leaf (which you won’t even <strong>have</strong> at this point), ask for the Tingle Balloon via the Tingle Tuner. Wait for the rupees to be subtracted and a target to appear below you, then simply walk across the air to the other side.</p>

<p>As this cheevo requires the Tingle Tuner, Wii U users will not be able to replicate this feat.</p>

<p>With Big Key in hand (or is it Boss Key?), it is time to deal with whowever is messing with Valoo. It turns out that Gohma is here, and rocking a new body of sorts.</p>

<p>The Grappling Hook is the key to this two phase battle. Don’t aim at Gohma. Instead, aim at Valoo’s tail! You’ll latch on successfully. Swing to the other side, and you’ll cause the ceiling to collapse on Gohma. Do that three times to pierce through Gohma’s armor. At this point, aim the Grappling hook at Gohma himself (Lock On helps). Lang a hit on the eye, and start using your sword. Two or three phases should knock Gohma out for good.</p>

<p>After every major boss, a Heart Container will spawn in. Ignore it if you are going for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/438802">Glass Cannon</a>, or pick it up otherwise. Enter the Wind Warp to be taken back to the exterior of Dragon Roost Island, where Komali will give you Din’s Pearl for defeating Gohma.</p>

<p>For now, follow the story and head South towards Forest Haven. Upon landing, purchase a Hyoi Pear or two from Beedle’s Shop Ship and start climbing up. You’ll have to defeat some Boko Babas and Octoroks along the way: utilize your skills and tools to make your way to the island interior.</p>

<p>With Firefly in Bottle, hop into the Boko Bulb and make your way up. Keep the Grappling Hook equipped for it’s needed to jump into a far Boko Bulb. With enough patience, you’ll make it to the top where the Deku Leaf is available. You’ll also gain the ability to use magic power at the same time as a bonus.</p>

<p>It’s time to immediately put that Deku Leaf to use. Glide towards the visible Boko Bulb and take the highest exit to the outside. You should see an island in the northern direction with a circular hatch/door thing. Play the Wind’s Requiem and have the wind blow north, then glide on over with the Deku Leaf. The man on this island, Manny, wants you to hit a switch on top of Forest Haven. Now use a Hyoi Pear and you’ll control a Seagull for a time. Guide the Seagull to the switch and this cheevo should be yours.</p>

<p>Now is the time for the first major backtracking segment. Sail back to Windfall Island. You can only sail on regions you have reached already: the King of Red Lions will prevent exploring additional areas at this time.</p>

<p>Upon landing, make your way to the lone grave where you’ll find Tott trying to dance and gain a sense of rhythm. Bring out the Wind Waker and he’ll show you the dance he’s trying to perform. Follow the movements and you’ll learn the song.</p>

<p>You have to head back to Forest Haven, so why not stop at Dragon Roost Island for a bit? You are allowed to take three pictographs (12 on the Wii U version), so may as well fill in the slots while we have space.</p>

<p>Head towards the Postman’s Desk, and take the nearby exit. Kogoli should be there: play the Song of Passing if you don’t see him. Take his picture. You have until Medli awakens as a sage to do this, but best to get it now and not forget.</p>

<p>Bring the photo with you (alongside whoever else you decided to photograph) to the Nintendo Gallery on Forest Haven. If you hit the crystal to open the way, a ladder will be available for you to climb, skipping the need to get to the top of Forest Haven every time. Enter the gallery, and give Carlov the picture of Kogoli. Step outside and play the Song of Passing twice, then re-enter. Speak to Carlov to have the cheevo pop.</p>

<p>Wii U users can give 12 photos at a time instead of just one. Take advantage of this opportunity!</p>

<p>It’s time to enter the Forbidden Woods. Go back to where you found the Deku Leaf, and find the grassy arrow. Take that passage outside, and utilize both the Wind Waker and Deku Leaf to enter the dungeon properly.</p>

<p>You’ll only find one small key in this dungeon. Use it to gain access to the mini boss. You already fought some grounded Mothulas, so now enjoy fighting the winged variant. While it is possible to land a sword swing if it flies down low enough, it may be best to use the Grappling Hook to stun it for the time being. You can parry its long charge attack if you time it right as well.</p>

<p>You’ll have to step out of Forbidden Woods for a time and go back to the Forest Haven interior. Fill a bottle with the water inside. It’s magical Forest Water: for 20 minutes (30 on the Wii U), you can use it as many times as you want. Now, bring it with you to the boss room.</p>

<p>Kalle Demos hangs above the room, suspected by creepy tentacles/vines. Use the Boomerang to send him down, making him vulnerable. Use the Forest Water and instantly win.</p>

<p>If you don’t have Forest Water, use the sword to defeat Kalle Demos. It may take two or three cycles since he will attempt to swallow you whole after a few seconds.</p>

<p>Niko is ready and waiting to test your rope swinging abilities again. This time, there’s no upper platform, but there are boxes. You don’t need every rope, and you are allowed to use the boxes. The cheevo comments provide plenty of tips. There’s also a YT video of a speedrunner doing it, but that one involves tricky double jumps off the same rope that make it hard to recommend.

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>One of the statue paths leads to the midboss battle against Darknut. He is heavily armored, but telegraphs just about all of his attacks. The best way to fight him is to parry at the start. You will either cut the strings holding the armor up, or do a Helm Splitter to destroy the helmet and expose the head. If you did the Helm Splitter, the Darknut should be stunned long enough to go to the back and cut the strings yourself. Note that the Darknut will move faster without the armor, so it is a tradeoff you must decide if it’s worth it. Patience is key to taking them out.</p>

<p>For those going for the challenge cheevo, be careful with even drawing your sword. You can only parry with a drawn sword, but if you face your opponent while doing so, you will instantly launch an attack towards them, disqualifying you from the cheevo. Instead, face away from the Darknut.</p>

<p>It’s not clear which parry attack is chosen when you use it, but as long as you connect with it, you are good. No matter which piece you take out, you have to rely on your munitions supplies to finish this battle. This means bombs. Yes, you can knock the Darknut’s Sword out, but it is still a sword, so don’t pick it up. Either time your bomb throws, or just stay close and go for risky face tanking strategies. Sometimes you can get lucky and have the Darknuts always run from you while you have a bomb out…but then get stuck trying to run out of bounds but failing to. Don’t rely on that happening all the time, but sometimes luck is all you need.</p>

<p>No matter how you defeat the Darknut, the Bow is your reward.</p>

<p>When you enter the boss room, you see Wham Bam Rock just…sitting in the wall. Approach the center of the arena, though, and Bongo Bongo will speak to you saying that you have done well, but must pass one more final challenge: the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantHandsOfDoom">Giant Hands of Doom</a>!</p>

<p>Have both Bow and Bombs equipped. Tiki Tong’s hands can be stunned with two arrow shots, though do not rapid fire them. Otherwise an arrow is wasted. Rudy may decide to use his hands to push you to the electrified floor or crush you, so do be ready to dodge.</p>

<p>Stunning the hands is not enough, however. Andross has to be stunned himself by shooting the eyes. Each eye must be shot twice: again, let some time pass between each shot. Mazaal may launch fire balls during this time, so be prepared to dodge.</p>

<p>Once the eyes are shot twice, DJ Octavio falls to the ground, stunned. Toss a Bomb into the mouth/cockpit to finally land a hit. Now do this two more times.</p>

<p>If you run out of bombs or arrows, Wonder Bowser is surprisingly fair and will provide some more for you. However, this is at the cost of redoing the entire cycle. Make sure to aim carefully if you want to avoid a prolonged battle with Knucklotec.</p>

<p>Once you explode Ram Rock three times, the battle is over. Get to the top of the Tower of the Gods and use the Grappling Hook to ring the bell.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about missing a pictograph, there is no need. Wham Bam Jewel is still there in the wall. Get a good pictograph and the figurine of Gohdan will be yours the next day.</p>

<p>Hopefully the above section wasn’t too repetitive. Unfortunately, we have peaked in both altitude and cheesy trope references, so the only way forward…is down. Beneath the ocean. Welcome to the sunken land of Hyrule.</p>

<p>By pulling the Master Sword out of its pedestal, you not only restored color, but also time. The Moblins and Darknuts are still causing a mess in Hyrule Castle’s hall, so it’s time to clean them out. They can be defeated the same ways as before, but be careful: they can sometimes work together. Once you defeat an enemy, step away from their corpse: almost all enemies drop something in this room, and you don’t want to accidentally pick up a recovery heart. Darknuts in particular always drop a prize orb: these contain recovery hearts almost all of the time if you’ve taken damage, and the goal is to not heal any damage taken during the challenge. If you take a death and want to try again, you have to reload the save. Keep a cool head and you’ll escape back to the Great Sea alive with another cheevo.</p>

<p><strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Cyclos</strong></p>

<p>Make your way to Northern Triangle Island from your current location. You should see a cyclone near the island. You want to sail towards it to start this encounter. Get a good pictograph if you care about that, and then hit Cyclos 3 times with your newly acquired Bow and Arrows. You’ll learn this warping song as a reward.</p>

<p>If you cannot defeat Cyclos in time, you may be sent closer to either Shark Island or the Mother and Child Isles. Double check your Sea Chart and sail to whichever of the three mentioned islands is closest.</p>

<p>From here, make your way to the Forsaken Fortress. If you decide to warp, use either Windfall Island, Tingle Island, or Greatfish Isle. (The next part explains why Mother and Child Isles isn’t going to work, but you can get that reward early if you wish.) Destroy the cannons if you wish, and then break down the door.</p>

<p>It is heavily advised you save your game here, while still on the boat.</p>

You can attack him during this time as well, causing a similar stun as if you won a tennis match. Once you pull off a stun, unleash your combos.</p>

<p><strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Helmaroc King</strong></p>

<p>Make your way to the top of the Forsaken Fortress, and use the Skull Hammer to open the door to the captured maidens. Tetra and her pirate crew will rescue them, but command you to deal with the distracted Helmaroc King. Once they escpae, the Helmaroc King returns, ready to do battle.</p>

<p>This is a two phase battle: the pictograph can be taken on either phase, so decide which one while also equipping the Skull Hammer and Grappling Hook.</p>

<p>The first phase is more of an escape sequence. The tower you are in is being flooded, and the Helmaroc King is trying to destroy the platforms you are using. Keep on rolling to get past everything. If you get knocked down, use the Grappling Hook when necessary to swing ahead. Once you get to the top, attack Helmaroc King with the Skull Hammer to climb to the flat portion of the arena and start phase 2.</p>

<p>The second phase requires baiting the Helmaroc King to attack you via pecking. Dodge during the windup, and then swing the Skull Hammer down on the mask. Do that a few times and the mask will fall off, exposing the vulnerable head. Repeat this action a few times, using the sword if you wish at this stage. Eventually Helmaroc King will go down.</p>

<p>There’s only one place to go now, so start the cutscene and learn of some possibly forshadowed truths.</p>

Wii U owners should consider Selfie Mode, but GameCube owners will have to consider rolling away a bit, then turning around to get a good picture. You have to do this in either the outside courtyard or the main hall: once you enter the chamber, it is too late.</p>

<p>Use the Ballad of the Gales to warp to the Mother and Child Isles. If this was any other island, you would be warped near the island and would have to sail to it. Here, though, you warp inside the Mother Isle. Inside this hallowed location is the Queen of all Fairies, who will give you the ability to shoot Fire and Ice arrows.</p>

<p>At this point, the story splits into two paths. You can do either the Earth Temple or the Wind Temple first. This playthrough will assume you go for the Earth Temple first.</p>

<p>You may want to follow <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/ToastedSyrup">ToastedSyrup’s advice</a> and start from the north-east side of the value with the wind also blowing north-east. Equip the Ice Arrows and Deku Leaf at minimum.</p>

<p>Shoot an Ice Arrow at the spewing fire from the mountain to cool the island off for 5 minutes. Climb up as fast as you can. If you reach a part where you are expected to sidle across a small gap, you can use the Deku Leaf instead.</p>

<p>Once inside, you have to hop across some platforms and do battle with Magtails. You have two options for quick kills here. You can use a parry attack to instantly defeat them. If you’d rather control the pace yourself, use the Boomerang to force-curl the Magtails up, and then smash them with the Skull Hammer. Either way, open the chest that’s spawned in to retrieve the Power Bracelets.</p>

<p><strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Kogoli</strong></p>

<p>Travel to Headstone Isle. The Power Bracelets are necessary to enter the dungeon. You’ll see a huge stone slab with some note markings on it. Use the Wind Waker to play the song, and you’ll earn this cheevo.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ll need Medli. Travel back to Dragon Roost Island. If you have <strong>not</strong> taken Kogoli’s pictograph yet, do so now before the opportunity is lost. After that, you’ll find Medli playing with her harp outside of the aerie. Play the Earth God’s Lyric and she’ll awaken as a sage. Bring her with you to Headstone Isle and start your trek through the Earth Temple.</p>

<p>This will be your first, but not last, encounter with this game’s iteration of Stalfos. They like to get up close and perform their own spin attack. Attack them while they are dizzy. Eventually, the bones will all separate. Destroying the head will take out all parts instantly, but destroying the other parts first may make it easier to take out the Stalfos later on. The choice is yours.</p>

<p>If you use the hammer throughout this fight, the skull hopping phase will be annoying. Either try to use side swipes or jump attacks for more effectiveness.</p>

<p>The Mirror Shield is yours after defeating the Stalfos.</p>

<p>Jalhalla must be defeated to allow Medli to do her part. The Mirror Shield and Power Bracelets are essential for this battle.</p>

<p>Jalhalla is simply a bigger Poe, so get under a light beam and reflect it back to him. The beam of light can move, and Jalhalla also has some dangerous attacks to watch for, so do be careful. Once enough light hits Jalhalla to make him solid, pick him up and toss him into one of the spiked pillars around the room. He’ll split up into 15 different Poes…wait: isn’t this just <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/427086">Boolossus</a> at this point? Either way, you’ll need at least three phases to take out all of the smaller Poes. If you already have the Hurricane Spin, now’s an excellent time to use it.</p>

<p>Medli will add her song/blessings to the Master Sword, allowing it to regain some of its full power.</p>

<h2 id="part-8-growing-with-the-wind">Part 8: Growing with the Wind</h2>

<p>With Medli safe in the Earth Temple, it’s time to address the situation with the Wind Temple. If you attempt to head to Gale Isle immediately, however, you’ll find a stone statue blowing a lot of wind against you. While sequence breaking to go past is possible, you’ll want the Iron Boots for the intended strategy due to everything else within the dungeon that requires them.</p>

<p>On circling Ice Ring Isle, find either the treasure chest or the initial steps to take you to the upper level. Launch a Fire Arrow into the “mouth” of Ice Ring Isle to start the five minute timer. Make sure the Deku Leaf and Wind Waker are equipped regardless.</p>

<p>If using the treasure chest to climb up, you may have to open it first. At this point, jump attack on top and then reach a ledge with the Deku Leaf. If starting from the initial steps, climb up and start the rush.</p>

<p>Make your way to the floating ice platforms. If you feel you are slipping too much, use the Wind Waker to stop yourself before you fall flat on your bum. This will pause the in-game timer, giving you a reprieve. Hop across successfully and you’ll be inside.</p>

<p>If you feel brave, take the “exit” path where the wind is blowing from a secret cave grotto, and time a good roll or two to get past. Otherwise, take the normal path with the ice slides. You can use the Deku Leaf to skip a slide or two if you feel lucky.</p>

<p>With practice, getting the Iron Boots under the time limit should be second nature.</p>

<p><strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Red Wizzrobe</strong></p>

<p>Getting the Pictograph of the Red Wizzrobe is very annoying because they can summon additional enemies. Be careful to take a picture of ONLY the Wizzrobe in question: you don’t want a summoned Peahat to photo bomb the opportunity. Yes, that can and will happen…</p>

<p>Equip the Iron Boots immediately upon entering the room, and also have Arrows of some kind for the battle. Locking on may be tricky since the Darknuts may get higher priority, so dodge them and aim manually when you can. Take out the summoned enemies if there are too many, then get more good shots in. The challenge cheevo will pop when the Red Wizzrobe dies.</p>

<p>If there are any additional monsters remaining, defeat them and then you will gain the Hookshot as a reward.</p>

<p>Molgera must be defeated before the Master Sword can gain its full power. Watch the sand pits that form, and maintain a respectable distance. Fire the Hookshot into the eye and start slashing. Molgera will soon retreat, only to pop up and attempt to fly around and swallow you! This attack can nearly one shot you if you are on a 3 Heart Run, so be careful. The cycle will now repeat with mini Molgeras joining the fray. They should not be infinite, but they can interfere with your aiming, so feel free to slash them away first. Three or four cycles of this should knock Molgera out.</p>

<p>Makar will add his song/blessings to the Master Sword, allowing it to be at full power.</p>

<p>If you feel you are missing anything at this stage, the Great Sea Atlas has the locations of everything not covered in this walkthrough, sorted by island. GameCube owners will want this for the wallets.</p>

<p>Most of the Fishmen have mentioned various locations of the “Triumph Forks”. You will be heading to these locations to get the Triforce Charts. Upon trying to read them, however, you find yourself unable to do that.</p>

<p>Do you remember Tingle? He gave you the IN-credible chart pointing to where the Triforce Charts are located. (How he knows of them in the first place is a mystery for another day.) He has the power to make the charts legible…for 398 rupees. Once deciphered, you can treat them as treasure charts and salvage them from the depths of the ocean.</p>

<p>Wii U owners will be lucky and only have to decipher three charts. The other five are replaced with the actual pieces.</p>

<h2 id="part-10-decorations-for-the-new-garden">Part 10: Decorations For the New Garden</h2>

<p>With the Triforce assembled, you are now ready to descend into Hyrule one more time. If you do not care about sidequests or pictographes, this will be the final time you go down. Whenever you are ready, head to the Tower of the Gods.</p>

<p>Head to where you first pulled the Master Sword. Zelda should be there waiting for you…wait a second!</p>

<p><strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Mighty Darknuts</strong></p>

<p>The Mighty Darknuts are ready to face off against you. They are just like the other Darknuts, only with a fancier armor set and cape. At this point, the chase is on.</p>

<p>Take the other exit out of Hyrule Castle. Go down the archway and you’ll eventually come across a barrier. With the power of the Master Sword and Triforce, you can shatter the barrier. Take the path ahead and you will eventually reach Ganon’s Tower.</p>

<p><strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Gohma, Kalle Demos, Jalhalla, Molgera</strong></p>

<p>To continue on, you must go through mini trials of four previous dungeons: Dragon Roost Cavern, Forbidden Woods, Earth Temple, and Wind Temple. Use what you’ve learned in each dungeon and you should be able to make it to the other side. Ganondorf apparently started to take lessons from Dr. Wily because the four guardians want a rematch with you! They can be defeated with the same strategies as before…and in fact, they must be. You can’t use any weapons that you gained later on in the journey! Only the Deluxe Picto Box is guaranteed to be available if you have it, so use it to get any pictures you have missed. I think the Wii U version allows re-fighting these four bosses as many times as necessary, but GameCube owners will only get the one shot.</p>

<p>After taking on the four trials, you will progress through a creepy passageway a strange pig wall ahead, and two passageways to the sides. Enter the right door and observe the lit torches. Now head to the room opposite you and hit the switches with your Boomerang in the correct order. You will activate a portal you can use with the King of Red Lions to head back to the Great Sea via Forsaken Fortress. When you are ready, head back to the torch room and jump down to the Tower Maze.</p>

<p><strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Phantom Ganon</strong></p>

<p>Phantom Ganon wants revenge on you as well! The same tactics work as before: reflect the shots back, get some quick sword hits in should he try to clone you, and otherwise be cautious. He also has a pink energy attack that requires the spin attack to send back, along with a clone attack. No matter which attack is used, stopping it and then starting a combo once should cause Phantom Ganon to escape, leaving his sword behind in the process. The sword will actually point you to the next room you need to go to. This cycle will repeat until you enter a room where a treasure chest will spawn after your victory. Open the chest for the Light Arrow.</p>

<p>At this point, make your way back to the initial room above the Tower Maze. Phantom Ganon wants one more crack at you. Use the newly acquired Light Arrows and snuff him out. Then shoot out the pig wall. At this stage, it’s a straight shot with many enemies to defeat to open the way to the penultimate battle against Puppet Ganon.</p>

<p><strong>Missable Photo Opportunity: Puppet Ganon</strong></p>

<p>To get a figurine for Puppet Ganon, get the picture, save, and quit. Head back to Carlov in the Nintendo Gallery for the figurine. You should already have the warp between the Forsaken Fortress and Ganon’s Tower active.</p>

<p>For those going for the challenge achievement, pretend the water is a donut. Do not leave the donut. There is minor leeway if you get knocked down close to the border, but in general you don’t want to push your luck. Otherwise, the strategies remain the same.</p>

<p>Puppet Ganon will have the same weak spot in all three phases: a giant blue ball at the back of the creature in question. Attack it with the Light Arrow three times to move on to the next phase. Of course, it’s not as easy as aiming and firing (unless you are <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Linkus7">Linkus7</a>). You will need to work around Ganondorf’s own defenses.</p>

<p>The first phase is the Beast phase. There are multiple strings holding the Beast puppet up. This may remind you of Kalle Demos, and it should. Use the Boomerang across the strings, and eventually you’ll bring the blue ball down. Now with one less dimension to worry about, aiming and firing should be simple.</p>

<p>The second phase is the Spider phase, or Bug phase. Puppet Ganon will spin wildly around until he suddenly stops. Then he will fall down. Note the shadow’s position and get into a better position yourself. You will not have long to get a shot off.</p>

<p>The third phase is the Moldorm phase. Puppet Ganon moves very fast in this form, so stunning the entire body is a good idea. Utilize your Bombs and try to cause some explosions to hit Puppet Ganon and force him to stop for a short time. Use that time to aim and fire.</p>

<p>After your victory, use the Grappling Hook and Hookshot to make your way up to the top. The final battle awaits.</p>

<p>No matter what you call this Gerudo warrior, he will show why he’s the final boss. This is a three phase battle.</p>

<p>For the first phase, stay on the defensive. Zelda has your Bow and Light Arrows, and is not afraid to use them. She will aim for Ganondorf, so make sure he is between the two of you. Once he is attacked with a Light Arrow, start unleashing your attacks until Ganondorf blocks. Keep this up until Ganondorf backhands Zelda, forcing Phase 2.</p>

<p>For the second phase, still stick to defense. Ganondorf will eventually do his own sword combo, leaving him open to a parry attack. Press the A button when indicated. If the parry lands, start your own attack combo. If it does not land, either change your position or try a pre-emptive dodge before the parry mechanic starts. After you land enough combos, Zelda wakes up from the slap.</p>

<p>For the third phase, it may seem like a repeat of the first phase. Ganondorf learned from his mistakes, however, and will dodge any Light Arrows shot at him. Approach Zelda, and she will give the solution: your shield! Stand at an angle while trying to face both Ganondorf and Zelda at the same time, and keep your shield out. You don’t want to be hit with a Light Arrow yourself! Once the Light Arrow is reflected onto Ganondorf, approach him and perform one more parry attack.</p>

<p>At this point, you can rest your fingers. You may have to accept a few more cutscene dialog boxes, but at this point you’ve won.</p>

<p>Wind Waker’s oceans occupy a 7x7 grid of squares. Each square measures 2000 units across by 2000 units down. Islands will be listed from Top Left to Bottom Right.</p>

<p>Each island will have points of interest and specific cheevos that are not covered in the story playthrough above. There may be some overlap, but not much.</p>

<p>Note that the majority of the descriptions found assume the GameCube version. The Wii U version changes some items around, and places five rewards behind new treasure charts that replace the Triforce charts. There shouldn’t be many difficulties, however.</p>

<p>It is recommended to perform this quest at night. Land on Windfall and set the wind direction to North. Take the path behind Salvatore’s Sinking Ships game and you’ll find a ladder. Get to the top and hit the switch: if the wind direction is set correctly, the windmill will start to move.</p>

<p>At this point, enter Slavatore’s house. Instead of playing the game, take the upstairs exit where Kreeb waits by the Windmill…which doubles as a lighthouse apparently. Ride the Windmill to the top, and shoot a Fire Arrow into the rotating hole at the top to light the lighthouse. Speak to Kreeb after doing so to receive a Piece of Heart and the cheevo.</p>

<p>Doing the above, however, also activates a treasure chest on the small island by the Bomb Shop. You can either use your Deku Leaf to glide to the island, or use the Hookshot to drag yourself to the chest. It is this specific chest that can only be opened at night.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Enter the Auction Floor at night, and wait for the prize in question to show. (See the section below for the prizes.) Each prize has a unique starting bid: go for the one where the starting bid is 5 Rupees. If it’s not this one, you can exit the Auction Floor and re-enter and hope for a new prize. If you continuously see Joy Pendants, you probably already have this one.</p>

<p>The key to earning this achievement is to stun your opponents into not bidding at all, but remember to pace yourself. While the total is below 40 rupees, you probably have to increase the bid by 10 rupees in order to stun the crowd. Once 40 rupees has been crossed, bidding 10% is usually safe, though you can probably toss in an extre rupee or two along the way. Try to not bid again until the stun timer expires (usually around 10 seconds).</p>

<p>Zunari will let you know when the auction is at 30 seconds, 15/10 seconds (forgot which one), and 5 seconds.</p>

<p>Bid smart, and the Treasure Chart is yours.</p>

If, after passing time, you don’t see Linda by the wooden stairs in the square, go to the Cafe Bar and the two of them should be there. Speak to them to receive a Piece of Heart.</p>

<p>Visit Doc Bandam in his Chu Jelly Juice Shop in Windfall. He needs 15 Green ChuChu Jelly for a green potion, and 15 Blue ChuChu Jelly for a blue potion. Be sure to have an empty bottle before turning in the jelly for best results.</p>

<p>This is missable because each Blue ChuChu Jelly can only be encountered once, and you can accidentally sell the jelly.</p>

<p>Enter the Cabana once you have the Deed from Mrs. Marie. Look at the completed picture to your left, then look to the jumbled up picture to your right. Welcome to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle">sliding puzzle</a>. There are many strategies available, but it is best for you to discover what works best. Note that the top right piece always seems to be missing when doing these.</p>

<p>Activate the four switches (you will need the Iron Boots and Skull Hammer for two of them). Then enter and pray to the Three Goddesses. The Miniblins will be the worst enemies you fight for they spawn infinitely until you have the final challenge of three Darknuts at the same time. Two Wizzrobes also join in to spoil the fun: take them out as soon as you can. You can heal all you want, but once you get hit for the 10th time, that is it.</p>

<p>For those doing this during their three heart run, watch out for jump attacks. The enemies can use them too, complete with the double damage effect. Darknut attacks can cause you to lose two hearts!</p>

<p>Put a fairy in a bottle. You can utilize any visited fairy fountain, or Mother and Child Isles if you have the Ballad of the Gales. Then visit Grandma.

<p>This is a game of patience. Attack when you feel you can, but pay attention to when Orca is about to attack. It may be better to adopt a more defensive play here: blocking instead of parrying could be more successful.</p>

<p>Note that there are technically rewards that can be skipped if you get 500 right away instead of 100 or 300, but they are not covered in achievements at this time.</p>

<p>Have both Power Bracelets and Mirror Shield alongside whatever else you feel you need. This is a long gauntlet of floors with minimal rest floors, and even those floors will heal you for 2 or 3 hearts at best in the early going. This is a long process, so consider bringing with you some Soup from Grandma.</p>

<p>If going for the challenge cheevo, good luck. Be very careful when doing spin attacks: if you hold the charge too long, you will do the Hurricane Spin, which uses magic. Any damage healed will <strong>not</strong> undo the lost health for the purposes of this challenge: if you enter with 14 hearts, heal at 4 hearts remaining, and lose 5 more, that’s it. Exercise extreme patience and caution. If you’ve already earned <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/417494">Cave of Despair</a> from <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/3934">Twilight Princess</a>, this one is (probably) easier.</p>

<h1 id="the-nintendo-gallery">The Nintendo Gallery</h1>

<p>The Nintendo Gallery is one of the first collection sidequests that speedrunners like to skip in 100% races, and for good reason. This quest requires constant vigilance in making sure you take all of your Pictographs correctly: a single mistake can force a second run.</p>

<p>As a reminder, you must first earn earn the Deluxe Picto Box. GameCube users must earn <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/404243">Apprentice Pictographer</a> and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/430033">Let There Be Light</a>. Wii U users only need to become the Apprentice Pictographer for the Deluxe Picto Box. Then, you must photograph everyone.</p>

<p>The Picto Box can only carry three pictures at a time. When you take a picture, you must hope to have a good view of the face and body. Visit Carlov in Forest Haven to turn any good pictures to figurines. Carlov can only turn one pictograph into a figurine per day. Utilize the Song of Passing (via <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/439047">From Dusk ‘til Dawn</a>) to have this process go by quicker.</p>

<p>Wii U users are able to take 12 pictures a day, and have all of them converted to figurines at once. Furthermore, a notice will appear when taking a Pictograph whether it will be good enough for Carlov to use. While the usage of the Tingle Bottle is not available for additional images, that is an optional tool in this case.</p>

<p>There are some Legendary Pictographs that are a part of this quest. Every night, Lenzo offers these for sale at 50 rupees a-piece. The picture you get is based on the moon phase. Not every character is available immediately: certain cutscenes and events must take place for them to be available. As such, it’s best to knock all of these out at once when you complete the Triforce.</p>

<p>There are seven sub-rooms of the Nintendo Gallery, and each one is worth a cheevo.</p>

<p>Tetra is missable, and she doesn’t make it easy to get a good photo of her.</p>

<p>Knuckle is also missable in the GameCube version: make sure to get his pictograph before getting every other character’s first! If you don’t have him by the time you complete the Triforce, make it a priority to do so.</p>
