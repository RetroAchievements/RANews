<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>This guide will be about all the achievements for the game, and will also help you into achieving the General rank, the highest rank in the game. It is possible to go for all of the achievements in 1 playthrough (minus 1 achievement) by using saves, and it is suggested to do so, as many achievements are easily missable due to some places or options being no longer available when getting far enough through the story, or some achievements related to certain events that you wouldn’t want to do them if pursuing the General rank.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105852.png" alt="" /> <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96039">Sweet Smell of Success (50)</a> <br />
Complete Act III with the General rank</p>

<p>Generally, to increase your rank the following is required:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer all the questions correctly and in the intended way by the game;</li>
  <li>Finish all the shooting segments by taking the fewest amount of damage and missing the fewest amount of shots;</li>
  <li>Do not die and select continue. Reloading a save circumvents this penalty;</li>
  <li>Don’t do any interactions that are considered bad, creepy, or that make you look incompetent. It is suggested to reload a prior save to these events if you do them;</li>
  <li>Using too many options that lead to nowhere will cause your rank to drop all the way to Captain. Either Spamming the same option, moving to places not required, or even using every option once, unless they they are intended to progress. It is suggested to follow a route that has the minimum amount of options used to get through the game.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are certain factors to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The amount of saves done does not matter;</li>
  <li>Time spent in total to finish the game is not taken into account;</li>
  <li>Score at the Shooting Range on any difficulty doesn’t have any impact;</li>
  <li>Most of the extra dialog or events that are not negative do not contribute for ranking.</li>
</ul>

<p>While doing the secondary events is not necessary, the game requires some events to be done to be able to get the General rank. Even just doing these events and nothing else can award you the rank, as long as the normal requirements for increasing the rank are followed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96001">Act 1 - Calling Loveline three times</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95782">Act 1 - Visiting the Fortune Teller</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95983">Act 1 - Eating Neo Kobe Pizza</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95783">Act 2 - Eating Ramen</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/189424">Act 2 - Visiting the Fortune Teller in Act 2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible to go for all the other events while going for the rank. However, some events will be bad enough to drop your rank, even getting just one of them. All of these events will be marked to identify which is which. For achievements about bad events, it is suggested to make a save before doing them, so to not jeopardize your run. Story related achievements won’t have a need to be marked, as you’d have to do them anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/a9e2e43b-d265-4dbf-9e32-cfec89acdf72" alt="" /> NEGATIVE - Will drop your rank</p>

<p><img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105858.png" alt="" /> <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96037">Saving the Day (25)</a> <br />
Complete the game with less than 3 saves</p>

<p>It is not suggested to go for this achievement on the first playthrough, as you’d have to work with just 2 saves throughout the game, while trying to do everything. It is better to go for this when done with everything else, so to not having to be preoccupied about rank, or use this opportunity to clean up anything missed.</p>

Find out about Random Hajile from the Chief</p>

<p>When meeting the Chief for the first time, you’ll be able to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ASK</code> him about any topics. If you pick <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABOUT JUNKER AUTHORITY</code> 3 times, you’ll get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABOUT BOUNTY HUNTER</code>S as an option. Choosing this, the name Random Hajile will be mentioned in the dialog.</p>

Use Jordan to look up Snatcher’s creator</p>

<p>You can do this as early as asking Mika <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HOW TO USE</code> in the Computer Room while she’s showing you around.</p>

<p>While in the Computer Room, pick <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE JORDAN</code>. Write the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KOJIMA</code> in the I.D. file search to find his file.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/178337.png" alt="" /> <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/158604">It’s the Only Way to Be Sure! (5)</a> <img src="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/a9e2e43b-d265-4dbf-9e32-cfec89acdf72" alt="" /> <br />
Shoot only the civilians and no snatchers without missing any shots while Mika looks on in horror</p>

<p>While Mika is showing you around Junker after meeting the Chief, you can go into the shooting range and choose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PRACTICE</code>. Instead of shooting Snatchers as you should, shoot all of the civilians instead, without missing a shot.</p>

<p>You won’t be able to save just yet, so you have to reset your game, so to not continue with the penalty and for doing the other achievement.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105690.png" alt="" /> <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95984">Snatcher Heart (5)</a> <img src="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8af2f203-6c6c-4a9f-98d3-27ba4f21befb" alt="" />  <br />
Get a perfect score without missing any shots at the shooting range while Mika is showing you around</p>

<p>Same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">It's the Only Way to Be Sure!</code>, but instead do it as you are supposed to. Shoot all of the Snatchers without missing a shot. And don’t shoot any civilians this time!</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/105809.png" alt="" /> <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/96019">Sharpshooter (5)</a> <img src="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/8af2f203-6c6c-4a9f-98d3-27ba4f21befb" alt="" />  <br />
Get a perfect score without missing any shots at the shooting range on the introductory difficulty</p>

<p>This can be earned at the same time as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Snatcher Heart</code>, due to having basically the same requirement.</p>

<p>Shoot all Snatchers, no civilians harmed, no shot missed.</p>

<p>For the rest of the achievements related to the shooting range, you’ll have to wait for Act II.</p>

Give the correct password to Napoleon, AFTER taking the steps to obtain it</p>

<p>Basically, do as you’re supposed to do it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Find the videophone number. You’ll find it by looking and investigate the brandy bottle Harry is drinking;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look up Napoleon on the Jordan to find the profile about the historical figure Napoleon;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After investigating the detective room, talk to Mika first about Buffalo Restaurant, then about Napoleon, so that she’ll suggest to find him.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When these steps are done, call him and he’ll ask to complete one of the two senteces he can give. The answers can be found in the Jordan I.D. file of Napoleon.</p>

<p>If he’s saying “The 100-year”, the answer is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">REIGN</code>.</p>

<p>On the highest difficulty, some civilians will be Snatchers disguised. They can be recognized only within a short time frame where they show their green eyes. The only tip that i can give here is to pay attention to the red bar on the left. It keeps track of how many Snatchers appeared. You can have an idea if there is a Snatcher among the civilians by watching if the bar increases.</p>

<p>I highly suggest to save after you get this difficulty. This is because if you make a bad enough score, the game can actually decrease the difficulty, requiring doing perfect scores in intermediate again.</p>

Act III - Survive the Super Insector battle</p>

<p>Contrary to all the other fights, this one is the only exception to the rule about perfecting all the fights. Unlike the normal Insectoids, these ones will jump in one place to another, and they also shoot faster. It’ll be very difficult to not get damaged, so just try to go through this fight without getting damaged too much or missing too many shots.</p>

Kill all the snatchers in the church without missing or taking damage</p>

<p>This is easier than the Super Insectoids just because the Snatchers appear one by one. Only shoot them in the head, as shooting anywhere else won’t kill them.</p>

Act III - Kill the… oh… shit…</p>

<p>After the Snatchers fight, shoot at the dark silhouette.
Instead of being penalizing, this will just soft reset your game. Beware about this one especially when going for low saves run.</p>

Complete Act III with the General rank</p>

<p>You should get this, and the other rank related achievements, when Mika salutes you.</p>

<p>In the end, what you need here is to have a complete route that has the fewest required actions to get through the game, and the events that are necessary to do. As long as you don’t make too many interactions that don’t contribute to progression, and avoid the negative events, you should be fine.</p>
