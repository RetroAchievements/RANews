<p>This game is one of the most requested for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/21031">PS2</a>, but the PSP version provides a more complete experience. It has 4 extra characters, new disc missions, and new game modes that can be a good challenge for some achievements, like completing the game in hardcore and with only 1 team. However, the graphics are slightly worse and the right stick is eliminated, but I think that it’s a small price to pay for exclusive content.</p>

<p>This game is an absolute fever dream! I don’t know how many people already know it, but the console ports of this game (GameCube and PS2) are totally different games than the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/5057">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/16240">DS</a> versions.</p>

<p>The gist of it is that you move to the SimCity and meet Darius, the most popular person in the city, who is seemingly revered as some sort of deity amongst all the cliques with all the propaganda around that’s just pictures of his face. He immediately tasks you with becoming more popular, which you’ll have to do by going to each part of town and working odd jobs while socializing with the locals until you’re popular enough to enter their party room, where each night you can meet Darius so he can give you a Power Social item that will scare off the villains mugging and bullying everyone in the district and get one of Darius’ secret parts.</p>

<p>From boxing ferrets to getting in fights with Fergie (yes, that Fergie), this game is incredibly weird, and I think it deserves some love as an under-appreciated title in <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/5727">The Sims</a> franchise. I’m certain anyone playing this would quickly realize how unique it is, and while it may not be revolutionary, nothing before or after it really has the same feel to it as the strange, nonsensical Urbz.</p>

<p>Metal Saga is an awesome RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world where the main story is in the background. The basic gameplay loop revolves around getting better tanks to take on outlaws (boss battles) to make money through their bounties and upgrade your current tanks’ arsenal. There are many tanks available to be found/bought/rented, several towns to visit, and even a casino on a train! Plus many hidden secrets, stories, areas, and multiple endings. The graphics may not be the best, but the vibe the aesthetic brings can be felt. All this and more (including comedic dialogues and stories) make this a must play.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to hack your way through Feudal Japan as one of the famous samurai lords? Well, this game is for you. The <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/6047">Warriors</a> series has been around for several decades and has grown from system pushing tech demos to cult classics. It’s not for everyone, sure. But Samurai Warriors has always been the better younger sister of the Warriors franchise. The stories are closely based on history, rather than loosely. The characters are all unique and have heroic traits and flaws.</p>

<p><a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/20790">Samurai Warriors 1</a> was an interesting trial for the first in series. It was dark, gloomy in tone and story, and a bit clunky to play. But Samurai Warriors 2 revitalized the genre. It came in swinging with more characters and a mass amount of maps and unique weapons. Samurai Warriors 2 deserves a trophy set for just the sheer amount of unlockable content the game has. The expansion, Samurai Warriors 2: Xtreme Legends, brought even more characters, items, and weapons to unlock. I grew up on this game and would love to play it again with trophies to unlock. This game actually got me interested in Japanese history enough to minor in it in college! And now I am writing a graphic novel based on the same time era.</p>

<p>Would love to share the experience of Samurai Warriors 2: Xtreme Legends with all you cheev hunters - a journey through 1500’s Japan, where your honor was bond by blood.</p>

<p>Castle of Dragon is just another action platformer for the NES, and overall, it’s a poor port compared to the original arcade game. However, for me it brings a lot of nostalgia to the time when children were introduced to video games (at least here in Brazil it started at some point at the turn of the 80s and 90s), where games had no tutorials and most of the learning curve in games was done by trial and error and memorization. In this scenario, I first discovered the game when my cousin bought it with a friend, but we were all very bad at video games and I remember spending hours dying on floating platforms, that after years, when trying again I realized it was very easy to get through.</p>

<p>The game itself I consider to be quite similar to <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/1710">Ghosts ‘n Goblins</a>, which I ended up not having access to as a child and didn’t become as memorable for me after playing it for the first time through emulation. But anyway, there are several influences: medieval themes with castles, armor upgrades, a map that shows progress between levels, etc. But unfortunately, not everything is the same… The controls are very bad, the character is slow, and when jumping the character doesn’t seem to get where it should. There is some variety of weapons, but it’s not really interesting, since once you get a morning star, there’s no reason to change it, even if it eventually causes damage to yourself.</p>

<p>In the second half of the game it stops being linear and starts to be divided into different paths between the floors of the castle, which at the time was interesting because it was not so common in games of this generation. But these multiple paths actually only served to change the order of the stages, as they were all mandatory and constituted an indispensable item for the final battle that inevitably always takes place in the same place. This part of the game can be very interesting if you know what’s going on, but at the time I played it it felt like a broken game, as we were instantly killed for running into the final boss, as no one had the game manuals or understood English to read them and have a better understanding of the game.</p>

<p>But in any case, despite not being a brilliant game, it is certainly a game in which nostalgia hits hard and brings back memories of that time when video games were being “discovered” here. It’s another one of the games I want to revisit someday and maybe finish or master after more than 30 years of failures.</p>

<p>I noticed some rather “underground” PS2 games getting achievements, but there is no set whatsoever for the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/8534">Sengoku Basara</a> series (or how the first game was localized, “Devil Kings”). I send this message almost in a begging manner for the series to finally receive a set, as it’s not only one of the best <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/6047">Musou</a> series, but also one of <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/9401">Capcom’s</a> best hidden gems that is currently on hold. Capcom did mention the saga in that “revival” poll they did recently, though. There were many great games that marked the PS2 era for me, but the Sengoku Basara series always hit me a bit different. It’s still one of my favorites and why I am sending this message.</p>

<p>Every once in a great while, a game comes along and changes the landscape of the genre. <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/10003">Super Mario 64</a> for platformers, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/7994">Guitar Hero</a> for rhythm games. Games that even people who may have zero overall interest in the genre in question, the games themselves are at a level of goodness that it requires at least a chance.</p>

<p>Untold Legends… is absolutely not that game. Hack and slash games are a dime a dozen, and most of them can be classified as average at best. Aggressively so. Untold Legends is very much no different in that regard. As a launch title for a system that attempted to do what no other previous system could do (compete with Nintendo in the handheld console space, a feat that I daresay the PSP did better than nearly every other competitor), both the system and the game itself would be an unknown quantity. Launch titles in particular have less scrutiny upon them simply because the console itself is an unknown. What do you do on something that has never been done before? You stick to the basics.</p>

<p>Untold Legends is, at its heart, nothing special. It’s another game where you smack giant trees and hordes of spiders in an attempt to make numbers go up, but at its core, the gameplay loop is sound, it gets the job done. Not all games reach the skies. Most are content being solid entries into their respective genre category, and Untold Legend… perhaps it’s a story that has been told dozens of times before, but it’s one that struck a chord with me in the early days of the handheld console war of the seventh generation.</p>

<p>A Nintendo DS game published by <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/5961">EA</a> may not inspire much confidence, but rest assured that this a real hidden gem, and one of the most underrated games on the system, not for lack of competition.</p>

<p>Our titular hero sets out on a journey to assemble the pieces of the mystical golden suit, in order to become the most well-dressed gentleman in the world! This game is a mix between a standard 2D platformer and a match 3 puzzler. Collecting items and defeating enemies in the platformer sends them to the puzzle on the bottom screen, where you’ll have to match blocks in order to kill off enemies permanently. Although this game does make use of both screens, no touch screen gimmicks are required and the entire game is playable with just a controller or keyboard, making it very emulation friendly. Although it’s not the longest game, it does get pretty challenging as you progress, making it more interesting for those more experienced in 2D platformers. However, there is a shop where you can buy upgrades with money you collect in the stages.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the presentation. This is a very nice-looking game for the DS, featuring clean sprites and animations. Perhaps best of all is the music, which is far, far better than it has any right to be. Each track for the levels fits perfectly, and the boss themes are a particular highlight. Even the music when you’re in the puzzle is great.</p>

<p>This game would fit well with standard progression achievements, as well as no-damage boss fights, which will no doubt be a satisfying challenge. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been much attention in terms of set requests, but I hope you can now see why this hidden gem for the DS is absolutely deserving of a set!</p>

<p>Greetings to all the monsters out there! Do you love the crazy nonsense of the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/6129">WarioWare</a> minigame vibe but you wish there was a Hallowe’en version for the trick or treat season? Well, look no further than GBA Microjam ‘23!</p>

<p>This is a collaborative effort from some really cool indie developers coming together to provide a casual gaming experience that is pumpkin-filled and silly. Sure, playing the game itself can be a quick and casual arcade experience, but I’m sure that replayability and competing with other players can give this game plenty of time to shine! This definitely seems like the kind of entertainment that achievements and leaderboards could easily tie into.</p>

<p>October may be over, but I think this would be a good game to bite into for some spooky fun!</p>

<p>Ahoy there, Mode 7 enthusiasts! Very nearly a launch title, HyperZone was produced by <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/7257">HAL Laboratory</a> and released September 1991 in North America after spending a month on the top-selling lists in Japan. A rail shooter modeled after the StarGate sequence from 2001: A Space Odyssey, HyperZone boasts 8 levels of Mode 7 graphics, steadily increasing difficulty and a notoriously difficult (for the time) final boss, but the game also loops infinitely after the final stage, enabling you to continue playing until your lives run out. Additionally, with each new extra life (earned through score) you get a new ship upgrade at the next level start, enabling charging weapons and stronger attack power.</p>

<p>The story is “all there in the manual”: In the year 2089, Earth has become uninhabitable due to war, and mankind is attempting to resettle on the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. In order to do so, an infestation of cybernetic beings must first be dispatched, including their mysterious leader who possesses psychic powers. “Shoot everything that moves” is the order of the day, so hop to it!</p>

<p>Gameplay resembles <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/252">F-Zero</a> or <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/351">Star Fox</a>, with your ship constantly barreling forward at a high rate of speed. Braking over “heal zones” allows for recharging energy, but brake too much and you begin to lose health. Some areas require strategically taking damage to access longer healing patches, but a damageless run is possible for every stage except Stage 7. Enemies vary wildly in shape, but generally attack by ramming or shooting white energy balls at you - your ship always explodes after a single hit, so defensive play is recommended.</p>

<p>In addition to high score, damageless/1cc achievements and the like, one possibility for a more difficult set would be “destroy as many enemies as possible with a single charged shot” - indeed, some levels allow for as many as a dozen enemies to be lined up with expert shot placement. Come develop this set that showcases Mode 7 graphics and an amazing soundtrack today!</p>
