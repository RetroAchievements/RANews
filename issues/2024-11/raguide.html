<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p><em><strong>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem</strong></em> is an action-adventure survival horror game developed by Silicon Knights, and produced and directed by Denis Dyack. It tells the story of ancient gods vying for power, putting you in the role of deciding which god takes power, and then defeating them. The game visits a small number of locations repeatedly, such as a forgotten city, the ruins of Angkor Thom in Cambodia, the Oublié Cathedral in Amiens, France, and the Roivas family mansion in (regrettably) Rhode Island.</p>

<p>This game features two interesting mechanics:</p>
<ol>
  <li>At the end of the first chapter, you get an opportunity to make a significant choice which decides which of three ancient gods Pious, our <em>player-character-cum-villain</em>, is aligned with. This has significant impact on the cutscenes, minor impact on the story, and changes what “flavor” of enemies the player will encounter throughout the game. We will talk more about this below.</li>
  <li>In addition to a health meter and a magick meter (the “k” is important here), standard for adventure games, there is a third bar: a sanity meter, in green. When your character beholds sights too strange or grotesque to be believed, their sanity will be lowered. When they deliver a finishing blow to these vulgar abominations, the sanity bar will refill a bit. Once your sanity is empty, further sanity-draining effects will instead deal health damage.</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, as the sanity meter lowers, strange effects begin to happen. You might see blood flowing from the walls. You might hear voices that shouldn’t be there. Maybe it isn’t the game at all. Maybe you are the one starting to see things. Are you feeling alright? Maybe you should take a break, dear reader.</p>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>A few things you’ll want to know before you start your playthrough.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Turn up the brightness. This game can be dark and oversaturated at times. Raising the brightness will help you quite a bit.</li>
  <li><strong>Save Often!</strong> You cannot save in rooms with enemies or traps, so don’t wait until things get dire, or you might find it hard to find a place to save. The chapter challenge achievements may not work when you load in the middle of a chapter, so I recommend keeping one save before you start a new chapter, and another one for saving in the middle of a chapter. We will talk more about the chapter challenges below.</li>
  <li>Which alignment you choose in Chapter 1 matters more than you might think. I am going to outline the three ancients and what to expect from a playthrough with each one of them. The ancient Pious aligns himself will affect the alignment of the majority (but not all) of the creatures you will encounter. You’ll have to do them all if you want to master the set, but if you just want to beat the game, here is what you need to know to have the most enjoyable time:</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="the-ancients">The Ancients</h1>
<p><a name="ancients"></a></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Chattur’gha</strong> 🔴 dominates <strong>Xel’lotath</strong> 🟢 with strength, but is weak to the magick of <strong>Ulyaoth</strong> 🔵.</li>
  <li><strong>Ulyaoth</strong> 🔵 dominates <strong>Chattur’gha</strong> 🔴 with magick, but is weak to the cunning of <strong>Xel’lotath</strong> 🟢.</li>
  <li><strong>Xel’lotath</strong> 🟢 dominates <strong>Ulyaoth</strong> 🔵 with cunning, but is weak to the strength of <strong>Chattur’gha</strong> 🔴.</li>
  <li>If you need a mnemonic to help you remember, it’s Pokémon rules (water beats fire, grass beats water, fire beats grass)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chatturgha-the-warrior-">Chattur’gha, the Warrior 🔴</h2>

<p><strong>Chattur’gha</strong> 🔴 is the ancient most closely associated with your <em>health meter</em>. Creatures aligned with <strong>Chattur’gha</strong> have red, sinewy, muscular bodies, a huge amount of health, and– frankly– hit like a truck. If you are trying to do the chapter challenges, which focus on either not taking any damage, or not using restorative abilities, this playthrough might make your life tough. Fortunately, they don’t drain as much sanity as other creatures, so there are some benefits, but their health pool is going to make fights against crowds a pain.</p>

<h2 id="ulyaoth-the-sorcerer-">Ulyaoth, the Sorcerer 🔵</h2>

<p><strong>Ulyaoth</strong> 🔵 is the ancient most closely associated with your <em>magick meter</em>. Creatures aligned with <strong>Ulyaoth</strong> share in his design: <strong>Ulyaoth</strong>’s form is similar to that of a jellyfish, and so his creatures look drowned or gelatinous as well. <strong>Ulyaoth</strong>’s creatures have an average amount of health, and are often easily downed (which you need to do to deliver a finishing blow to restore sanity), but many of them drain your magick meter. In a normal playthrough this would be tedious, but as you won’t be using as much magick in the chapter challenges, this might be an acceptable compromise.</p>

<h2 id="xellotath-the-scholar-">Xel’lotath, the Scholar 🟢</h2>

<p>(<em>Author’s note: Xel’lotath route is considered to be, in some ways, the easiest and most enjoyable route, so if you don’t plan to master the game, this is probably the one I would recommend. It is also my opinion that Xel’lotath’s cutscenes have the best writing.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Xel’lotath</strong> 🟢 is the ancient most closely associated with your <em>sanity meter</em>. Creatures aligned with <strong>Xel’lotath</strong> have a miserable, wrapped appearance, relatively low health, and are downed somewhat easily. They can still function even when body parts are removed, and they inflict sanity damage, often repeatedly, during combat. Of the three alignments, <strong>Xel’lotath</strong> zombies are the only ones who are susceptible to fire, which can down them in one hit, leaving them free for a finishing blow if you don’t wait too long. If you are planning to do the chapter challenges on <strong>Xel’lotath</strong>, be warned: you will need to be much more diligent about sanity management or you will quickly find yourself losing health.</p>

<h2 id="mantorok-the-corpse-god-">Mantorok, the Corpse God 🟣</h2>

<p><strong>Mantorok</strong> 🟣 is the god of chaos and is not an alignment that Pious can choose. <strong>Mantorok</strong>’s role is to keep balance among the other ancients, but due to a binding spell that Pious casts in Chapter 2, <strong>Mantorok</strong>’s power is weakened. Occasionally, you will encounter zombies that look black and withered. These husks are considered to be aligned with <strong>Mantorok</strong>. They are extremely weak, except in large numbers, and are also susceptible to fire.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The first trapper you encounter in the game is in Anthony’s chapter. This one is in a tight hallway, and Anthony doesn’t have a ranged weapon. <strong>Save before attempting this.</strong> Your two options are to either attempt to sneak by, or bait it into attacking (which kills it) without being transported. Trappers are blind, and use sound to detect. Sneaking by it might be possible, but the hallway is narrow, and to sneak by, you need to move slowly enough not to excite it, making this dangerous. My preferred method is to wait until it reaches the bend in the hallway, run near it to excite it, and run out of range as it attacks.</p>

<p>This is the only trapper that should give you problems. Every other trapper in the game can be killed either with a ranged weapon (gun, chakram, crossbow) or with the <em>magickal attack</em> spell, which you should do rather than risking it.</p>

<p>This is by far the easiest of these challenges. Pious doesn’t have a sanity meter, so there is often no reason to engage with combat at all. Avoid enemies, just run past them, and rush through this chapter. If you know where you’re going, this takes about 3 minutes to get through the whole chapter. My advice is to just ignore as much combat as possible.</p>

<p>The trap rooms are the real challenge here. Make sure you save the guard to get your sword back (read below), as it will be invaluable for restoring your sanity meter. Don’t neglect your sanity meter or it <strong>will</strong> be the reason you fail this challenge. Near the end of the chapter, when you’re running through the rooms filled with zombies, just be aware that you will be running back through these rooms a few times. Some zombies can deal further sanity damage on the runback, and new enemies will be added during the runback, so managing your sanity meter diligently will save you.</p>

<p>This one is mostly about learning the layouts of the trap rooms to avoid stepping on the pressure plates. Once you’ve done this, it’s pretty straightforward. If you trigger a trap near the start of one of the trap corridors, don’t be afraid to just back out of the hall and return immediately to reset them. Traps can be easily dodged, but it’s even easier not to risk it.</p>

<p>After picking up the blowgun and falling down the trap door, your sword breaks. Use your blowgun to kill the two zombies before they kill the guard. If he survives, pick up your broken sword and take it to him. He will cast <em>Enchant Item</em> for you to repair it. What a nice guy!</p>

<p>Of the three damageless chapters, this might be the hardest one, depending on how comfortable you are with combat.</p>

<p>Saving the priest will earn you a two-handed sword, but the real prize here is that torch. There are a number of <strong>Mantorok</strong> 🟣 zombies, which all die in 1 hit to the torch, and if you’re playing the <strong>Xel’lotath</strong> 🟢 route, the aligned zombies will too. That is going to simplify a lot of this stage, honestly.</p>

<p>In fact, the real danger here is that you have to fight an aligned horror at the end of the stage. <em>Enchant Item</em> on your two-handed sword before heading up the ladder. The trick to not taking damage in this fight is to bait out punches by running near enough for him to swing, back up out of range, then quickly run in to attack one of the heads, and then <em>immediately</em> run far enough again that his small AOE punish can’t hit you.</p>

<p>Once you win, head down the stairs and use your torch on the last three zombies, and you’re in the clear!</p>

<p>The chapters are starting to get longer, and with that, the chapter challenges are loosening their restrictions. Now you can take damage, but you can’t recover. Basically, all means of recovery are blocked here (this includes healing items, since all of the healing inventory items just cast <em>Recover</em> on your behalf, and yes, that counts)</p>

<p>If you are good at combat, you might find the <strong>Chattur’gha</strong> 🔴 or <strong>Ulyaoth</strong> 🔵 routes to be easier here, surprisingly. Their creatures have more health and deal more damage than <strong>Xel’lotath</strong> 🟢, but they don’t inflict quite as much sanity damage, and sanity is secretly the killer in this stage.</p>

<p>After clearing the rune barrier (<em>Santak</em> rune) blocking the ladder, go down. Make sure you grab the torch off the wall here. That will help you with <strong>Xel’lotath</strong> 🟢 and <strong>Mantorok</strong> 🟣 zombies.</p>

<p>Grab the second Tulwar if you want, but the weapon you’ll probably have the most success with is the Ram Dao, at the bottom of the ladder blocked by the <em>Narokath</em> rune barrier. Unfortunately, after grabbing this, you’ll start the first of <strong>two, different</strong> enemy rushes. These are the real killer.</p>

<p>The first enemy rush is four (4) waves, two waves of <strong>Mantorok</strong> 🟣 zombies, followed by two waves of aligned zombies, the last of which also has bonethieves. This is going to drain your sanity <em>a lot</em>. It can be helpful to space out downing enemies (the Ram Dao targetting a zombie’s head will down them in 1 or 2 hits) so that you have time to go back and clean them up with finishing moves.</p>

<p>After reaching the inner shrine of the city, you’ll find yourself at the end of a blocked hallway in <em>another</em> enemy rush. Same deal here. These aren’t quite so cleanly separated into waves, but rather enemies will constantly trickle in. Finding time to deliver finishing moves will be <em>crucial</em> to your success. This ends with a few bonethieves and then (ugh) a horror.</p>

<p>If you managed all that, kudos to you!</p>

<p>With all the practice you’ve had dealing with horrors, this stage will hopefully feel a little more doable. The stage begins with fighting a horror immediately after discovering the Tome of Eternal Darkness. Make sure to deal finishing blows after each autopsy.</p>

<p>When you encounter the horror holding one of the primary runes in your “sanity effect” later, the damage dealt by this one will be undone (it was a figment of your troubled mind, remember). Just didn’t want you to worry too much. I’ve got you!</p>

<p>Now you can head down into the basement with <em>Reveal Invisible</em>. Run past the two zombies or fight them (those are in fact the only two options). You’ll encounter a <em>Lesser Guardian</em> at the entrance to Ehn’gha, so cast <em>Enchant Item</em> on your sword with the appropriate alignment on the stairs after you clear the <em>Bankorok</em> rune barrier.</p>

  <li>Bonethief: a bonethief breaks the stained glass window at the end of the second floor hallway, but if you miss that autopsy, some of the aggressive servants in the house have bonethieves inside them. Additionally, one of the zombies in the basement has a bonethief as well. They’re like grotesque Matryoshka dolls</li>
  <li>Horror: the horror that contains the Redgormor rune near the start of the chapter</li>
  <li>Guardian: you will fight one of these at the entrance to Ehn’gha, and killing it will end the chapter. This performs an autopsy automatically</li>

<p>This one can be a little tricky. The Mantorok zombie is pretty easy, since the <em>Bankorok</em> rune is held by a Mantorok zombie at the entrance to Ehn’gha. You could miss the autopsy, but you probably won’t.</p>

<p>The trapper is a little harder. If it attacks, you probably won’t get a great chance to autopsy it. The key is to shoot it and rush in before it disappears. There is a trapper in the kitchen, and another one in the upstairs bathroom.</p>

<p>This is a tough one. This chapter is <em>so long</em>! Normal advice applies: manage your sanity diligently. Some rooms can be freebies for sanity management. For instance, a few of the stairwells have zombies that start on the ground, but they don’t deal sanity damage until they stand up. If you behead them before they look at you, you can finish them off for a sanity bonus without having ever taken the initial sanity loss. That’s pure profit, baby!</p>

<p>Some of the trap hallways have switches that will fill the room with green gas, which slowly drains your health. This is bad news. If this happens to you, make sure to get out of there as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>I would recommend <strong>not</strong> attempting this challenge in the same run that you get the <strong>Mantorok</strong> 🟣 rune (read below), because the <em>massive amount</em> of backtracking is really going to stretch your meager resources. Some people reading this might take that as a challenge (I see you), so honestly, you do you, but I would advise against it.</p>

<p>After descending into the temple one level, you’ll encounter a wall protected by a magical barrier, powered by one rune for each of the ancients. These runes can be cleared by using <em>Dispel Magick</em> on the plinths in each of the corner rooms. Once you’ve dispelled the barrier, there is still one problem: the gap in the wall is too small for Edwin to crawl through.</p>

<p>After collecting the <em>Tier</em> and <em>Aretak</em> runes much later in the chapter, you can now build the <em>Summon Trapper</em> spell. It’s time to backtrack to that wall (it’s a long walk, pack a lunch), and summon a trapper to walk through the hole. Walk across the bridge between the two horrors, and have the trapper step on the purple switch. A door will open in the hallway, revealing the <strong>Mantorok</strong> 🟣 rune. Just collect it.</p>

<p>Once you collect the <strong>Mantorok</strong> 🟣 rune, one of the horrors will break down the wall. Kill him or don’t (I don’t care, I’m not your mom), but run into the room behind him. Sweep the cobwebs on the floor near the Mantorok switch to reveal the <strong>Mantorok</strong> 🟣 codex.</p>

  <li>#6 <strong>Summon Trapper</strong> (<em>Tier</em> + <em>Aretak</em>) - summon trapper and control it (🟣 cannot summon)</li>
  <li>#7 <strong>Shield</strong> (<em>Bankorork</em> + <em>Santak</em>) - add protective shields</li>
  <li>#9 <strong>Magickal Attack</strong> (<em>Antorbok</em> + <em>Redgormor</em>) - deal damage to enemies</li>
  <li>#11 <strong>Magick Pool</strong> (<em>Tier</em> + <em>Redgormor</em>) - restore meter over time, 🔴🟣 additionally restore stamina</li>

<p>This one isn’t too bad. Understanding the structure of this chapter does a lot to help. In short, the chapter goes like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>get the Tome of Eternal Darkness and the emerald</li>
  <li>go to the bell tower to get the old tower key</li>
  <li>go to the old tower to find Anthony and get the ruby</li>
  <li>get the music from the tower library and the 5-point circle from the organ</li>
  <li>go to the basement to fight the horror and get the sapphire</li>
  <li>head down into the catacombs to find the hidden shrine (proof of heresy)</li>
  <li>take proof back to the custodian in the bell tower</li>
  <li>take knife back down to the catacombs</li>
  <li>finish stage</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a few techniques to help with combat in Paul Luther’s chapter and chapters going forward. First, your two new favorite spells are <em>Enchant Item</em> and <em>Damage Field</em>. Use <em>Enchant Item</em> to make your weapon strong against whoever you’re fighting. Use <em>Damage Field</em> to put a wall between you and enemies. It doesn’t have to be a large field; 3-point <em>Damage Field</em> can be quite effective. Just focus on using it to stun and hurt enemies, and stand behind it (while still doing damage of your own on top of it).</p>

<p>Use <em>Damage Field</em> to make the fight against Anthony easier. Your <em>Damage Field</em> probably won’t do much against the horror, nor will you have a great opportunity to set one up, but <em>Enchant Item</em> on your mace can help. Just remember that <strong>all Mantorok 🟣 spells are prohibited</strong>! <em>Damage Field</em> on the narrow bridge in the sacrifice room before examining the custodian’s body on the table will make the fight against the bonethieves trivial.</p>

<p>Due to the damage floors near the end of the stage, note that <strong><em>Shield</em> is not prohibited</strong>. This one should be straightforward. Keep your shield on at all times, and then all that you need to really worry about is sanity drain. Don’t get cocky, manage your sanity levels, and this one shouldn’t give you too much trouble.</p>

<p>After using the <em>Reveal Invisible</em> spell to reveal the bridge to reach the “Forgotten Corridor” Key, leave the room again. Back in the narrow hallway leading back to the ladder, there is a <strong>Sapphire Effigy</strong> sitting on a small ledge on the left. It’s pretty easy to miss it (especially if <em>Reveal Invisible</em> runs out) so make sure you don’t miss it. This one is really easy to overlook and will lock you out of the Enchanted Gladius in Michael’s chapter.</p>

<p>This is just a long chapter. No real advice, other than to try to clear out the bonethieves in the nave when you get a chance to. Combat is a bit sparse here, and much of it can be avoided, but as always, don’t forget to manage the sanity drain. Ostensibly, the challenge here should be fighting the Black Guardian without taking too much damage, but that’s an achievement of its own, and <a href="#ach-black-guardian">there are instructions below</a> on how to do this without too much trouble.</p>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Surprisingly, the above two achievements should be done at the same time. Before entering the fight, be sure to grab the magickal potion from the binding hall. It has 5 doses, and fully refills Peter’s magick meter each time. Also, assign <a href="#ancients">the 7-point <em>magickal attack</em> that is strong against Pious’s ancient</a> to a quick button.</p>

<p>Make sure your sanity is topped off before entering the fight, if you can afford to. You don’t want your spell to fizzle because you were dealt sanity damage that became health damage.</p>

<p>This fight is one of the parts of the game that differs significantly depending on Pious’s alignment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chattur’gha</strong> 🔴 Black Guardian has giant lobster claws and attempts to deal damage directly. First phase it will shoot missles that can be dodged, then a tongue attack that tries to grab the player. If the tongue misses, the boss will be vulnerable for a few seconds. Cast your 7-point <em>magickal attack</em> as soon as you avoid the tongue to have enough time for the incantation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ulyaoth</strong> 🔵 Black Guardian is a jellyfish-like body with hooks and long legs. First phase it will setup three orbs that it will send out toward you. These can be targeted and destroyed with your gun if you want to do that. Once the third one is gone, it will instantly become vulnerable for a few seconds. Rush to cast the 7-point <em>magickal attack</em> and it should connect. If you want to improve your chances, you could do this in two cycles, with a 3-point and a 5-point respectively, but the 7-point should work consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Xel’lotath</strong> 🟢 Black Guardian is a giant headless creature with a Xel’lotath rune where its head should be. First phase, it will repeatedly charge an “electric” attack to target you. There are two versions of this. One will never miss you, but it only drains a bit of sanity, not actual damage. Another is one that targets the ground where you’re standing, so it can be avoided. After the ground target, it immediately becomes vulnerable. Rush to cast the 7-point <em>magickal attack</em> and you <em>might</em> have enough time to land it. If you want to improve your chances, you could do this in two cycles, with a 3-point and a 5-point respectively. 7-point has a high chance of being too slow, but it <em>can</em> be done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second phase is similar with all three versions: first it will summon 3 same-alignment zombies, then after a few seconds it will become vulnerable. The best timing is to begin your 7-point <em>magickal attack</em> timing when the third zombie begins to spawn. With this timing, the magickal attack should connect around the same time as the window of the Black Guardian’s vulnerability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the last phase, you are in close quarters. With <strong>Ulyaoth</strong> 🔵 and <strong>Xel’lotath</strong> 🟢, you can run around the Black Guardian; with the <strong>Chattur’gha</strong> 🔴 fight, you are constrained to stay in front. In all three versions, after a number of avoidable close range attacks (🔴 claw slam, 🔵 big stomp, 🟢 shock attack) it will stop attacking and then become vulnerable. If you start a 7-point <em>magickal attack</em> right when the attacking stops, the magickal attack should connect during the window of vulnerability, finishing the fight.</p>
  </li>

Unlock the basement door and head down to use the Lucky Penny on the breaker box. Trip the breaker and the lights will come on in the upstairs bathroom.

<p>The major challenges here are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The fight against the vampire.</strong> A combination of <em>Enchant Item</em> and <em>Reveal Invisible</em> will go a long way to making this more manageable. Remember that once you get access to the basement, destroying the obelisk is priority #1, since that’s how he heals. Hit it 3-4 times with your enchanted saber and it’ll break. Then finish off the vampire to get some sanity back. Then, it’s time to head down to Ehn’gha.</li>
  <li><strong>Ehn’gha is filled with enemies.</strong> The two stages that actually spend time in Ehn’gha are <em>so long</em>. If you keep moving as quickly as possible, avoiding combat as much as you can, you might be alright. For most stages, that strategy doesn’t work, but Edward has a flask of “liquid courage”. 7 doses that each refill about 30% of his sanity. It is very possible to get through all of Ehn’gha using this alone. Really, the greater hazard at that point is just being low on stamina and getting winded.</li>

<p>The vampire is easy to kill, and with careful planning, can even be caught before it reaches the master bedroom. As early as possible in Edward’s chapter, head to the piano room to grab the saber off the wall. Once you encounter the vampire for the first time, collect the bottom of the basement key and head to the foyer. Cast <em>Reveal Invisible</em> of the appropriate alignment, and <em>Enchant Item</em> of the appropriate alignment on your saber.</p>

<p><strong>Wait for the vampire to reach the master bedroom before engaging with it again!</strong> Cruelly, if the vampire doesn’t attack the servant in the master bedroom, he won’t give you the key as thanks. Once he does, attack the vampire a few times to make it retreat. Before hunting the vampire down again, talk to the servant in the master bedroom, and he will give you a key to the gun cabinet in the upstairs guest room. Go get your elephant gun. (<em>Note: there are no elephants in the game, so what’s the point even?</em>)</p>

<p>At the beginning of Michael’s chapter, you will be given whichever effigies you’ve collected in the previous Forbidden City chapters (Karim’s and Bianchi’s). The only one remaining to be collected is here in Michael’s stage.</p>

<p>After assembling the staff and opening the secret passage, Michael gets the Tome of Eternal Darkness. At this point, either head forward or backtrack until you reach the underground tunnel leading to the rest of the temple. In this dusty tunnel, there is an <strong>Emerald Effigy</strong> surrounded by a 5-point <em>Damage Field</em>, which you can dispell with your own 5-point <em>Dispel Magick</em>.</p>

<p>Later, in a small hallway, you will find 3 bas-relief sculptures on the wall, colored red, green, and blue. These represent the three ancients in positions of power. If you’ve looked at the effigies in your inventory, they are all red, green, and blue statues in positions of being subjugated. Place each of your effigies in front of the sculpture that <em>dominates</em> it. For instance, place your 🟢 <strong>Emerald Effigy</strong> in front of the 🔴 red bas-relief. (Placing the wrong statue will summon a horror for each wrong one, so– uh– don’t mess up!) Once you’ve placed all three, a stairwell will appear in a room two rooms before this one revealing the Enchanted Gladius.</p>

<p>(<em>The real kicker: Michael can’t even use it! His only job is to give it to Alex. What a rip-off!</em>)</p>

<p>By the time you get to this point in the game, you’re a bit of an expert on combat. A little bit of advice couldn’t hurt, though.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The fight has two main phases: (1) While the artifact is still intact, hitting him will make the artifact appear. When the artifact appears, hit it. Eventually this will transition into ghost forms of the characters you’ve played before joining in. Ghosts should look for the artifact and attack it. (2) Once the artifact breaks, just keep attacking Pious. If you got the Enchanted Gladius from Michael’s chapter, be aware, if you hold R to target Pious, it shoots projectiles. These are very powerful!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mantorok</strong> 🟣 or <strong>Chattur’gha</strong> 🔴 <em>Magick Pool</em> keeps your stamina maxed out, meaning you can run indefinitely without tiring. This can be helpful in combat. Don’t bother casting more than a 3-point version because it can be dangerous if mistimed, and Pious loves to cast <em>Dispel Magick</em> which will clear both <em>magick pool</em> and <em>shields</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid damage by running in front of Pious to bait out a melee attack, take a <em>wide</em> berth around him (wider than you think is necessary, you’ll be surprised) to avoid getting hit by the backswing, and then come up from behind and attack his head whenever possible.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    </tr>

</table>

<p>The reason Sanity Recover is allowed here is because you’re gonna be here a <em>long</em> time. Seriously, tuck in.</p>

<p>Once the artifact breaks, put away your sword. It’s time for old fashioned fisticuffs, Marquess de Queensberry rules. Pious has 200 HP (plus whatever his 7-point <em>Shield</em> spell adds, if he chooses to cast that), and your punches do 1 damage (2 damage if you target his head), so get ready. Use the advice from the previous achievement for avoiding damage, and when Pious uses <em>Magickal Attack</em> position yourself far away from him to give yourself a chance to stop moving and recover stamina.</p>

<p>If you do manage to get into a position where you can punch him safely (from behind), keep in mind that you can usually get multiple hits in a row. He still takes damage even if he’s teleporting away, so just keep swinging like your name is Jack Dempsey.</p>

<p>This sanity effect will trigger automatically following the end of Karim’s chapter. The War against the Darkness rages on in… Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Redemption. Coming soon. (Yeah, I’m sure! We all saw what happened to <em>Shadow of the Eternals</em>.)</p>

<p>When your sanity meter is low, find a safe place to remain unpaused, and then get up and walk away. Yes, seriously. It’s a screensaver. Get up, go get a drink, use the restroom, call your mother (you haven’t called your mother recently). Just be prepared for a fright when you come back to the image of a spooky skeleton on your screen!</p>

<p>When your sanity meter is low, use the healing spell. This one does not trigger arbitrarily, but rather is in response to using the Recover spell while being low on sanity. It may not happen the first time you cast Recover, but over the course of a playthrough, this will almost certainly happen naturally once or twice.</p>

<p>When your sanity meter is low, save your game. This one does not trigger arbitrarily, but rather is in response to saving your game. If you are looking this one up, you definitely aren’t saving your game enough. <strong>Save your game</strong>, ya putz!</p>

<p>This is probably the rarest unscripted sanity effect, so try to be patient with this one.</p>

<p>This has been reported to happen between Alex and Maximillian’s chapters, and between Paul Luther and Paul Jacob’s chapters. The premise is that, sometimes, when walking through a door or passage, rather than going to the room you intended to, you instead experience a sanity effect where you end up in the other person’s environment. Paul Luther might walk into the nave of the church and it might be a field hospital during WWI, like in Paul’s chapter.</p>

<p>I had some success triggering this by lowering my sanity and just walking around a bit, but sanity effects are random and it could take some time. Here is what I recommend: when you complete Edwin Lindsey’s chapter, and you are back in the mansion with Alex, summon a trapper and walk around with it a bit. Summoning a creature drains your sanity. Once your sanity is empty, just walk around the house for a while, preferably in some of the main areas. There aren’t a lot of options for sanity effects in the Roivas mansion, so you might be more likely to get this one.</p>

<hr />

<p>Everything below here is totally random. In the course of three playthroughs, you will <em>most likely</em> see them all, but I’ll keep my fingers crossed for you!</p>
