<h4 id="essential-info--tips">Essential Info &amp; Tips</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Links to specific sections in this guide may only work if that specific section is opened <em>(eg. a link to an achievement in a specific category won‚Äôt work if that category‚Äôs guide is not open).</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All achievements are single player focused, even the ones for the Multiplayer Mode, <em>Showdown</em>. A potential real Multiplayer subset could easily be made if there‚Äôs enough ask for it, or if another developer wants to create one (most of the necessary RAM has been code noted).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>All achievements will be disabled when using cheats, unless stated otherwise. Make sure no cheat is active in the <em>Cheat Menu</em> prior to restarting or starting the required mission for the achievement. Usually a whole mission should be completed from start to finish without using cheats. The Cheat Menu is used to activate cheats. This menu can be opened via the Pause Menu and is accessible once at least 1 cheat has been unlocked via Bounty Hunter Mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="Progression">
    üèÜ Story Mode <i><sub><sup>(20 achievements)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

<p>These are the player‚Äôs bread-and-butter <em>progresion</em> achievements for playing through the story. The last one under this category, Redemption, is the <em>win condition</em> for ‚Äúbeating‚Äù the game.</p>

<p>These achievements will only unlock in Story Mode, not in Bounty Hunter Mode. Any difficulty can be used to unlock these. <sup> More on difficulties, refer to <a href="#StoryChallenges">Story Mission Challenges</a> </sup></p>

  <h4 id="additional-notes">Additional Notes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The player is required to finish a mission from start to finish without using any cheats. Although a select few of these custom-made challenge achievements require certain cheats to be active for the <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> to show up. The best way to be eligible for unlocking the achievement, is to activate the cheat once the mission starts. Then restart the level through the pause menu. If everything is in order, a <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> should be displayed, telling the player he‚Äôs eligible for unlocking the achievement.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>To access cheats, players must first unlock them by completing missions in Bounty Hunter Mode, which becomes available after finishing the game once on the selected player profile. A detailed list of which cheats correspond to specific Bounty Hunter missions can be found on the <a href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Cheats_in_Revolver" title="Red Dead Fandom Wiki - Cheats">Red Dead Fandom Wiki - Cheats</a>. Each unlockable cheat is tied to at least one achievement in this category.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Don‚Äôt forget to turn off the cheats if they‚Äôre not required for certain achievements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>As long as the <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> is active the player is eligible for unlocking the achievements under this category when the post-mission reward menu is displayed. Specific details on trigger and <a href="#RA_Measure">measured indicators</a>  are documented per achievement.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If for some reason the achievement doesn‚Äôt unlock, or the <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> is not displayed. Double check the difficulty, mission and cheat requirements of the achievement then restart the level when all requirements are set correctly.</p>

Do not go through the tunnel! If the player does go through it without encountering Curly first, he won‚Äôt spawn anymore. So the player has to follow the upper path first which is blocked by rocks.

Now it‚Äôs important that Curly will partially follow the player, It‚Äôs advisable that the player goes in heads first and kills the bandits as fast as possible.

This is the part where the player will want to have some Deadeye meter still available as at the exit, you‚Äôll find a few bandits across the valley, possible killing Curly. Make sure rush to the exit and kill all bandits before Curly gets shot. If the player is able to kill all bandits inside the tunnel and at the exit, Curly will drop a bag of coins worth $1,500. <br /><br /> - A <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> will be displayed once the bag of coins is picked up.

    üèÜ Bounty Hunter Mode <i><sub><sup>(20 achievements)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

<p>The Bounty Hunter Mode is unlocked when the selected player profile has completed the Story Mode once. The player is required to finish a Bounty Hunter mission from start to finish without using any cheats. Even if a Bounty Hunter mission is already marked as <em>completed</em> on the main menu, the player can still replay the mission as a way to unlock the achievement.</p>

<p>Some of these Bounty Hunter Mode challenges can be pretty hard. If you‚Äôre having trouble please refer to <a href="#WalkthroughsResources">Walkthroughs &amp; Resources</a> or search any youtube video‚Äôs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="additional-notes-1">Additional Notes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> will be displayed at the post-mission overview menu when the Bounty Hunter objective has been reached. The achievement should pop around the same time that the game shows which item the player has unlocked.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Bounty Hunter Missions which require a certain cash combo to be achieved will display a <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> during the mission once the required combo has been achieved. Finish any other objectives and the mission itself to unlock the achievement.</p>

      <p>A <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> will be shown on the Showdown menu/at the main menu when all required settings for a Showdown achievement are correct. This indicator will hide once the loading screen starts or when any settings are incorrect. Although this indicator is not necessary to have been displayed for the achievement to be unlocked.

      <p>When a <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> is displayed on the post-match overview menu, the player has completed the Showdown challenge. On pressing OK, to display the continue popup window, the achievement should unlock.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>GAME BUG</strong>: The <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> shown when setting up the Showdown match at the main menu may not display properly when shifting through the Showdown stages too fast <sub>(the ID which checks for the selected Showdown stage may not update properly when shifting through the stages too fast‚Ä¶)</sub> To make the <a href="#RA_Trigger">trigger indicator</a> appear properly, just don‚Äôt shift through the Showdown stages too quickly.
