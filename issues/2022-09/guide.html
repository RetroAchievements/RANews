<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Dragon Force was one of the most highly rated games on Saturn. It is a strategy-RPG where you select a kingdom and play through a non-linear, unique campaign to unite the other seven monarchs of Legendra and form the Dragon Force. Only then can the dark god Madruk, who is threatening all of mankind, be challenged and defeated. The game features both campaign-level map conquest as you move armies between strategic locations including castles, towns, shrines and towers as well as real time battles opposing forces lead by generals command up to 100 troops each. The game boasts one of the best sound tracks in retro gaming history with almost all of the music being extremely well made.</p>

<h2 id="set-design">Set Design</h2>

<p>Due to the non-linear design of the game, there is significant variety between play throughs and even more variety between selected kingdoms. In order to provide exposure to the game’s full content, it was determined that play throughs of each kingdom, focusing on their unique aspects would be the most appropriate course of action. As such, each kingdom has over 20 kingdom-specific achievements that can only be unlocked during its specific play through and an additional 39 achievements that can be earned while playing as any kingdom.</p>

<p>Each kingdom offers a unique experience and potential for a different approach to the conquest portion of the game. As such, the set was designed to maximize players’ exposure to the aspects that differentiate each kingdom. Kingdom-specific achievements are a mix of progression and challenge achievements.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

<p>The achievements require the following linked hash:</p>

<p>Dragon Force (USA) <img src="https://retroachievements.org/Images/labels/redump.png" alt="" />
acb9d7194d31fb2ea6967fce3558efe1</p>

<h2 id="achievements">Achievements</h2>

<p>When playing through the set, focus only on the achievements available to whichever kingdom you selected as well as the achievements marked [Any]. Nearly all of the missable achievements are quite straight forward to set up if following a general outline. A good practice for each kingdom is to recruit Vlad at the earliest opportunity and follow this guide’s recommendations for fulfilling the kingdom-specific Zanon storylines. Additionally, whenever you intend to fight an opposing monarch, ensure your monarch is part of the invading force. These two simple rules of thumb will cover the vast majority of missable achievements.</p>

Note, in order to get the missable achievement [Highland] A Knife in Borgon’s Back[m], redirect the army that defeated Ogredd and Lone during their victory animation (pause if needed) back to one of your castles. If you fail to do this, retreat from the fight against Borgon’s forces before entering into battle with any of them. You will need to wait for the next domestic session for Ogredd and Lone to join for that missable achievement.</p>

<p><em>Defeat Borgon and his two henchmen, Diablo and Faliel, in a single encounter with Ogredd and Lone in your party. Ogredd and Lone must each win at least one battle, lose none and Ogredd must be the one to kill Borgon on the battlefield</em></p>

<p>After you have recruited Ogredd and Lone, deploy them and anyone else you wish, to attack Travan castle. During the battle Borgon, Diablo and Faliel must all be part of the enemy force and will be only unless you previously fought and killed some of them. I recommend using Lone to defeat the weakest enemy general and only use Ogredd to fight Borgon himself.  Utilize other generals such as Wein and Rudger to defeat any other enemy generals.  Borgon has low health and will not retreat, so Ogredd should not have a problem defeating him.</p>

<p><em>Win the support of the Palemoon kingdom without fighting Teiris</em></p>

<p>The easiest way to get this achievement is to have Wein engage any Palemoon general in battle. Instead of fighting, the Palemoon empire will join forces with Highland. Another method is waiting for the next domestic session after encountering at least one Palemoon general with any of your generals, but do not fight Teiris herself. At the next domestic session, Palemoon will join Highland. The only way to miss this achievement is to fully capture Teiris during the same week in which you initially encounter any Palemoon general. It is very unlikely you would do this without deliberately attempting it as it would be quite challenging and heavily luck dependent.</p>

<p><em>Visit the Shadow Tower and receive news of Scythe and Gaul’s disappearance</em></p>

<p>Required progression - After a progress related domestic event where your advisor discusses the Shadow Tower, visit it with Wein. It is located north of the large lake which is northwest of Topaz castle. During the Shadow Tower event, you will meet Ramda and upon exiting the tower learn of Scythe and Gaul’s disappearance automatically.</p>

<p><em>Resist Goldark’s ambush and defeat him</em></p>

<p>When you are nearly finished gathering the other monarchs, with the exception of Goldark, he will disappear at some point and then subsequent reappear and immediately enter battle with Wein. This achievement requires Wein to defeat Goldark during that ambush and not retreat from the battle. In order to ensure you are fully prepared always keep Wein’s troop count maxed as the timing of Goldark’s ambush cannot be precisely predicted after he disappears.</p>

<p><em>Rescue Teiris from Ryskim with Zanon’s help</em></p>

<p>To get this event, you must have recruited Vlad and defeated Ryskim with him after Ryskim’s first appearance. Additionally, you must have encountered Zanon and gotten at least one domestic event discussing him - that will happen immediately after Wein’s first encounter with Zanon (retreating is fine). Do not fully complete Zanon’s storyline before getting this achievement as he will disappear and Ryskim will not reappear and kidnap Teiris. When Ryskim does kidnap Teiris, simply engage and defeat him.</p>

<p><em>Witness Zanon kill himself to seal the dark sword Eclisis</em></p>

<p>This event is the finale of Zanon’s storyline in the Highland campaign. It will trigger after several iterations of field encounters with Zanon and domestic events. The Zanon storyline requires an engagement with Wein to begin and then will subsequently alternate between domestic events and additional encounters. Some other progression events are required to progress the Zanon storyline, so be patient as it unfolds. It can be accomplished as late in the game as collecting the sacred weapons from the shrines.</p>

<p>Required progression - After Katmando has begun to move and Wein and Goldark recover the Stargem sword from the Northern Shrine, Ramda will attack Katmando.

<p><em>Deploy an army consisting of Wein, Rudger, Galam, Nina and Link and engage another army. Each of them must win at least one battle and lose none</em></p>

<p>The most difficult part of this achievement is finding an enemy force with at least five generals. Typically large groups of generals can be found guarding castles or conducting offensive attacks in the region between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor. When you are ready for this achievement, deploy the required army with max troops around this area and look for either a deployed army or castle with at five or more generals. Ensure each of your generals wins at least once and does not retreat or get defeated in any battles during the engagement.</p>

<p>Required progression - After a progress related domestic event where your advisor discusses the Shadow Tower, visit it with Mikhal.

<p><em>Resist Goldark’s ambush and defeat him</em></p>

<p>When you are nearly finished gathering the other monarchs, with the exception of Goldark, he will disappear at some point and then subsequent reappear and immediately enter battle with Mikhal. This achievement requires Mikhal to defeat Goldark during that ambush and not retreat from the battle. In order to ensure you are fully prepared always keep Mikhal’s troop count maxed as the timing of Goldark’s ambush cannot be precisely predicted after he disappears.</p>

<p><em>Rescue Shione from Ryskim with Zanon’s help</em></p>

<p>To get this event, you must have recruited Vlad and defeated Ryskim with him after Ryskim’s first appearance. Additionally, you must have encountered Zanon and gotten at least one domestic event discussing him - that will happen immediately after Mikhal’s first encounter with Zanon (retreating is fine). Do not fully complete Zanon’s storyline before getting this achievement as he will disappear and Ryskim will not reappear and kidnap Shione. When Ryskim does kidnap Shione, simply engage and defeat him.</p>

<p><em>Witness Zanon kill himself to silence the dark sword Eclisis</em></p>

<p>This event is the finale of Zanon’s storyline in the Izumo campaign. It will trigger after several iterations of field encounters with Zanon and domestic events. The Zanon storyline requires an engagement with Izumo to begin and then will subsequently alternate between domestic events and additional encounters. Some other progression events are required to progress the Zanon storyline, so be patient as it unfolds. It can be accomplished as late in the game as collecting the sacred weapons from the shrines.</p>

<p><em>With an army of only Mikhal and his troops, defeat an opposing force consisting of at least three generals</em></p>

<p>A significant troop advantage and use of the Sonic Blast skill are immensely helpful for this achievement. Try to target a force of three generals with low troops counts.</p>

<p><em>Win a battle with Mikhal using the Breach tactic</em></p>

<p>The Breach tactic is used to cross the battlefield as quickly as possible. It is most effective against a ranged opponent, but simply having a superior number of troops is sufficient for this achievement most cases.</p>

<p><em>With an army of only Mikhal having 100 samurai troops and Wein having 100 soldiers, defeat an enemy force of at least four generals.  Mikhal and Wein must each win at least two battles and not lose any</em></p>

<p>Target an enemy force with an inferior troop count.  Look for enemy forces of four generals in the area between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor. It is recommended to first annex Bozack and then Highland during the campaign to quickly recruit Wein with enough time to prepare for this achievement while enemy forces still possess large numbers of generals.</p>

<p><em>Win three battles with each of Izumo’s four main generals, Zagat, Jackal, Shione and Mistal, but do not let any have more than one win more than any other at any time</em></p>

<p>The goal of this achievement is to get all four generals to three wins, but never letting one get too far ahead of the others.  The way to do this is to ensure all generals get one win before any of them get a second win.  Then ensure they all get to two without anyone getting to three first. Lastly, get to three wins with each of them. Losses are not a factor in this achievement so retreat from battle if necessary to prevent an unwanted win. This achievement will be missed if any of the four main generals has more than a 1 win lead at any time prior to unlocking.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271166.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Izumo] To Slay a Dragon</strong> (5 points)</p>

<p><em>Defeat a dragon general with Zagat, Jackal or Mistal</em></p>

<p>The Tradnor general, Gigg will most likely be the easiest dragon general to encounter, especially early on. Just prior to the final phase of the campaign, however, many dragon generals will roam the map giving you easy access to engage any of them at your convenience.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Have Zagat, Jackal or Mistal command dragon troops in battle</em></p>

<p>Use a Dragon Crest item on any of these generals to enable them to command dragon troops, then switch to dragon troops and begin a battle. Dragon Crests can be found by searching in Crystal castle during the domestic phase.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271170.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Izumo] Yon Shinobi</strong> (5 points)</p>

<p><em>Using an army of four ninja generals, win an engagement against a force of at least four enemy generals. Each ninja must win at least once and nose lose any battles</em></p>

<p>Any general that can use the Assassin Star skill or looks like a ninja such as Hayate, Shirox, Shione or any of the generic ninja generals will work for this achievement. A good place to find an enemy force of at least 4 generals is in the area between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor kingdoms.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271159.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Izumo] Rising Daimyo</strong> (5 points)</p>

<p><em>Have Zagat, Jackl or Mistal command 100 samurai troops at once before Mikhal is able to command 100 samurai</em></p>

<p>Use awards to raise any of the three aformentioned generals max samurai troops to 100 and actually recruit 100 before you award Mikhal enough times such that he is able to command 100. The achievement will lock as soon as Mikhal is able to command 100 samurai after presenting the award, so stay at 90 or less until this achievement is unlocked.</p>

<p>This achievement will be missed if you do not reach Zanon in the first week with Reinhart. Immediately bring Reinhart to Lightan castle to meet Zanon. It is recommended to retreat from this initial engagement and have Reinhart wait until the end of the week at the town nearby.

<p><em>Have Uryll resurrect 100 troops during a single battle</em></p>

<p>The easiest way to unlock this achievement is have Uryll able to command 100 of any type of troop, but enter a battle with none recruited. Troops don’t need to die first in the battle, only be brought into it via the Resurrect skill. She also needs to have 8 MP as her Resurrect skill will need to be used four times as it will bring 25 additional troops each time it is used. Once a troop is resurrected it’s fine for it to die. If you have less than 100 total troops or begin the battle with some troops, make sure you are missing at least 25 before you use Resurrect in order to maximize the number of resurrected troops with each cast.</p>

<p><em>With an army of only Reinhart and Uryll, engage and defeat an enemy force of at least four generals. Reinhart must fight only once and win and Uryll must win all other battles</em></p>

<p>Due to her strong Resurrect skill and her access to the Ensnare skill, as long as she has a decent amount of MP, Uryll is arguably the strongest general in the game. Make sure that she and Reinhart have high troop counts and then find an encounter with at least four enemy generals. The best place for this tends to be in the area between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor. Make sure Reinhart only wins one of the battles and Uryll wins all others.</p>

<p><em>Occupy five castles by the end of the first week, not including Magicka castle</em></p>

<p>This achievement is only possible during the first week of the campaign. Topaz begins with only five generals and when the week ends, each one of them needs to be occupying a different castle. This method for this is variable as the opposing kingdoms do not always behave the same way. You will have to determine which forces you can quickly overwhelm to seize castles and may have to abandon castles if they cannot be defended. The castle that you can rebuild to the south of Topaz called Magicka castle does not count toward this achievement.</p>

<p>This event is the finale of Zanon’s storyline in the Topaz campaign. It will trigger after several iterations of field encounters with Zanon and domestic events. The Zanon storyline requires an engagement with Leon to begin and then will subsequently alternate between domestic events and additional encounters.

<p><em>Win two battles in a single encounter with Leon by having two enemy generals opt to retreat instead of duel him</em></p>

<p>Magician and Priest generals are by far the most likely to retreat from duels, but they will also retreat from battles almost as soon as their last troops get killed. Sometimes you will find a retreating enemy army that has just been defeated and no longer has any troops. One that has several generals with significantly lower HP than Leon is likely to be useful for this achievement. Make sure Leon has no troops, but high HP to give yourself the best chance at an enemy general retreat.</p>

<p><em>Kill more than 100 zombies in a single battle with an army of monks</em></p>

<p>In order to get this achievement you must fight against an enemy general that uses Zombie troops and can resurrect some of them. The most convenient candidate is Vlad since his troop count will always match Leon and he will resurrect them. You do not need to finish or win the battle because the achievement will unlock as soon as 101 zombies are killed in a single battle.</p>

Additionally, you must have encountered Zanon and gotten at least one domestic event discussing him - that will happen immediately after Gongos’s first encounter with Zanon (retreating is fine). Do not fully complete Zanon’s storyline before getting this achievement as he will disappear and Ryskim will not reappear and kidnap Katt. When Ryskim does kidnap Katt, simply engage and defeat him.

<p><em>Wrest Eclisis from Zanon, subdue him and then recruit him</em></p>

<p>This is the most complex Zanon storyline in the game. It requires a series of interactions with Zanon and armies not containing Gongos as well as subsequent domestic events. Ultimately you cannot mess it up, but always attempt to approach Zanon first with an army that does not contain Gongos and if that doesn’t trigger a new event, then try an army that does contain Gongos. It is highly recommended that until the final encounter, after you’ve rescued Katt from Ryskim, to retreat from Zanon encounters when possible. You will also ocassionally get domestic events related to Zanon. In order to get him to join, you must progress all the way passed the Katt rescue event and then approach Zanon with a party that contains Gongos and his four main generals, Rygar, Baghib, Katt and Yuni. This will trigger the event in which Eclisis is taken from Zanon and he will join following a battle. Unfortunately it is so late in the game by the time this happens that Zanon is essentially useless as a playable general. This achievement is missable if you do not confront Zanon with the correct party for the final event.</p>

<p><em>Kill more than 60 troops using Junon’s Sonic Blast skill. Junon cannot be using mage or archer troops</em></p>

<p>Do not have Junon in command of mage or archer troops even if none are recruited. This achievement is easiest to earn fighting against a monarch with 100 troops when Junon starts with none. The enemy will immediately issue a melee command and all troops with collapse into the middle and charge Junon. This will create a very nice grouping for Sonic Blast to strike. The initial enemy troop formations do play a small factor in how the troops group and lead to various numbers of troops getting killed. Over 70 kills at once is possible.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271597.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Tristan] Air Inferiority</strong> (5 points)</p>

<p><em>Gain Vlad’s trust and recruit him</em></p>

<hr />

<p><em>Recruit Hayate and Shirox</em></p>

<p>Visit the town immediately south of Mikeral castle with your monarch to trigger an event and fight with Shirox. Defeating him will force another event at the next domestic session. After that, leave and return to the town with your monarch to initiate a fight with Hayate. Defeat him and he and Shirox will join at the subsequent domestic session. The Shirox and Hayate events depend on whether your monarch is aware they are part of the Dragon Force. Most monarchs can recruit Shirox and Hayate from the start of the game, but Gongos in particular must wait until nearly the end of the campaign though.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/272208.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Any except Fandaria] A Noble Dragon</strong> (10 points)</p>

<p><em>Recruit Vangal</em></p>

<p>Recruiting Vangal varies slightly between campaigns, but always requires a town to be visited by your monarch. Vangal may either fight you and immediately join or disappear for several weeks and rejoin after another dragon general, Zado attacks you. In any case, all that is needed is to trigger the initial town event and the rest will play out quickly. Fandaria cannot initiate these events. The Vangal town event can be found in the following towns for each campaign:</p>

<p>Highland and Palemoon - Second town to the west of Galfiel castle, it’s the one in the mountains
Izumo - Town immediately southwest of Danyan castle
Tradnor - Town north of Estonia castle
Topaz, Bozack and Tristan - Town between Travan and Crystal castles</p>

<p><em>Meet Bastion in the field and seduce him into joining</em></p>

<p>Bastion will start the area north of the Fiend Tower. He may remain at the town, but he may also move based on other kingdom’s forces encountering him. Approach him with a female general and he will join your forces. If approached by a male general, you will fight him and upon defeating him he will be captured and this achievement will be locked.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/272214.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Any] Your Very Own Versailles</strong> (10 points)</p>

<p><em>Increase a castle’s level to 50</em></p>

<p>Castle level’s will gradually increase while you are occupying them on them on the field or through domestic fortifications. You must be in occupying a castle when it reaches level 50 through either method to unlock this achievement. Palemoon castle generally starts a high level, so send some of your generals who can fortify there and continue fortify during domestic sessions and do not vacate the castle during the weeks.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/272486.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Any] The Conquest of Legendra</strong> (10 points)</p>

<p><em>Defeat the Skull Chidren, Gasper, Helm and Tzuvan</em></p>

<p>The Skull Children spawn in randomly near the beginning of the campaign and try to directly attack your monarch from wherever their starting location is. If they encounter and are defeated by another kingdom’s general they will not respawn anymore and will be replaced by Paine and Agonni. The Skull Children are not uncommon, so if you intend to master the set, you will almost certainly have several chances to earn this achievement. The Skull Children do not spawn during the Fandaria campaign.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/272210.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Any except Fandaria] Temporary Relief</strong> (3 points)</p>

<p><em>Kill Paine and Agonni… at least for the time being</em></p>

<p>After the Skull Children are defeated, Paine and Agonni will spawn in almost weekly and attempt to reach your monarch. They will never retreat from battle, so just kill them with any available force capable of doing so and you will unlock this achievement.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/272232.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Any except Fandaria] The Dirty Duo [m]</strong> (10 points)</p>

<p>After visiting the Shadow Tower and witnessing Gaul and Scythe’s disappearance, they will ambush your monarch as they are leaving the area surrounding the Shadow Tower. You can defeat Gaul and Scythe here with a sufficient force and unlock this achievement, but if you have to retreat, the campaign will progress and Ramda instead will banish them.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271067.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Any] Take That!</strong> (2 points)</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/272249.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Any] Sapped</strong> (5 points)</p>

<p><em>During a battle, fully deplete the enemy’s special skill charging meter</em></p>

<p>The special skills Assassin Star and Mirage Star possessed by ninja generals will deplete the enemy’s special skill charging meter. Different general’s have varying degrees of success with the skills, so depending who you are using it may take a well timed use after the enemy general uses a skill of their own or possibly more. The thief general skill, Shiva’s Dagger is also viable.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/272251.png" alt="image" /> <strong>[Any] Outnumbered But Not Out Matched</strong> (10 points)</p>

<p><em>Defeat an enemy force of at least eight generals</em></p>

<p>Only armies in a castle can contain more than five generals. Finding a castle with eight or more generals can be difficult and it will almost always be Tradnor, but others may do this from time to time. A much more reliable method is to bring a general with four or more (depending on how many enemy generals are already present) to Lightan castle and immediately retreating. The captives will transfer over to Zanon’s control and then he will recruit them by the beginning of the next week. He will not deploy these generals so Lightan castle will be sufficient although you will have to face Zanon in the final battle, so only give up weak generals.</p>

<p><em>Issue the melee command as your initial order in a 100 versus 100 troop battle and win</em></p>

<p>Using troops with significant advantages over the opponents such as beastmen over cavalry, monks/mages over zombies or samurai over dragons will give you the highest probability of success.  Additionally using a general with a power skill such as Teiris’s Dark Vortex or one with Sonic Blast will make this achievement more easily doable.</p>

<hr />

<p>Having a general with very powerful special skills or finding an enemy general with low health are required to unlock this achievement.</p>

<p><em>Only using Vlad and Sierra, defeat an enemy force consisting of at least four generals. Vlad and Sierra each must fight at least once and cannot lose any battles</em></p>

<p><em>Defeat an army of 100 samurai with an army of 100 dragons</em></p>

<p>Unless the campaign lasts for an incredibly long time, Mikhal will likely be the only general that will command 100 samurai at once. Using a Dragon Crest that can be found in Crystal castle will enable any of your generals to command dragon troops. Select a general with a skill like Teiris’s Dark Vortex or Sonic Blast in order to significantly reduce the number of samurai troops.</p>
