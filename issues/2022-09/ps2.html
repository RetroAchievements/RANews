<p>PlayStation 2 support is finally coming to RetroAchievements on October 1st! Our achievement developers have been hard at work, and the results are incredible. Appropriately for the best-selling console ever, this is by far the biggest console launch in RA history - a staggering 69 sets are ready for launch on day 1 (at the time of publication), and more keep pouring in nearly every day! We at RANews express an enormous THANK YOU to the developers, as well as the <a href="https://pcsx2.net/">PCSX2</a> team for their cooperation in implementing achievement support, without whom this would not be possible.</p>

<p>We have compiled a brief preview of each of the games that will be available on launch day. These games represent a wide variety of what the PS2 has to offer, and we hope these synopses help make the decision of what to play a bit less daunting. Keep in mind that this list only includes the games that will be available on day 1; many of the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/setRequestList.php?s=21">most requested</a> PS2 games are in active development and are expected in the coming months.</p>

<p>Without further ado, now presenting the RetroAchievements PlayStation 2 day 1 lineup:</p>

<p>While the PlayStation 2 was known for its golden trio of 3D Platformer Mascots, a bunch of other (anthropomorphic) mascots debuted during this generation as well. In comes Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, the dual-wielding boomerang tiger starring in a 3D collect-a-thon platformer set on a fictional island inspired by the continent of Australia. This achievement set will focus exactly on what you want from a game like this: collect everything in every level, with a bunch of challenges added to doing so! This game ended up spawning two more sequels on the same system as well, one that we’ll see later down the line!</p>

<p>See where it all started in the very first entry of the juggernaut that is the Monster Hunter series. Even from the beginning, Capcom had the gameplay loop figured out; you’ll go off on quests, hunt monsters, craft better equipment from their parts, and repeat the process with bigger and tougher monsters. 17 large monsters are present, including some of the series’ most iconic foes such as Rathalos, Plesioth, and Diablos. There are also 7 weapon types to choose from, allowing players to pick their favorite playstyle. Join the hunt and see what makes this series so beloved.</p>

<p>Based on the Cartoon Network television series with the same name, Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures is a 3D Platformer structured around six different stories that mirrors the origins very well. All three of the main protagonist are able to be controlled interchangeably with their own unique abilities to overcome the game’s obstacles. The objectives of this achievement set are to collect the titular Jawbreakers the teens love so much, as well as discovering some neat Easter Eggs!</p>

<p>After six mostly successful games on the SNES and PlayStation 1 respectively, it was only a matter of time for the Mega Man X series to head into the third dimension. Mega Man X7 ended up being that game, featuring a new playable character called Axl who joins X and Zero on their quest to put an end to the ongoing Maverick threat. All expected standards are still here, like the eight stages to go through with an animal-based Maverick waiting at the end. The rescuable Reploids also make a return, making it a key aspect of this achievement set alongside the collecting of power-ups, beating the bosses without damage, as well as unique challenges.</p>

<p>PopCap Hits! Vol 1 combines Bejeweled 2 and AstroPop into one package. Bejeweled is the granddaddy of match-3 puzzlers, and it’s difficult to overstate just how widespread its presence was in the early 2000s. AstroPop may be a lesser known PopCap title, but that doesn’t make it any less worthy of your time. You control a spaceship, grabbing and sorting blocks into matching colors with your tractor beam to eliminate them. Multiple modes are included in each game as well, meaning you’ll need to master many styles of play in order to conquer this achievement set.</p>

<p>Although The Sims is best known for its PC games, Bustin’ Out eschews this by not only being a console exclusive, but taking the series in some bold new directions. The brand new “Bust Out Mode” is more objective-driven, featuring a storyline and plenty of tasks to complete, lending itself quite well to achievement design. If the classic simulation gameplay is more your style, however, that’s included here as well. Whether you’re looking for a blast from the past or a fresh twist on a familiar game, Bustin’ makes you feel good.</p>

<p>The year is 2401 and a still war rages between humanity and the TimeSplitters. Bent on destroying humanity, the TimeSplitters are a sadistic alien race that use time crystals to change the course of history so that our civilization crumbles apart. It’s up two space marines, Sergeant Cortez and Corporal Hart, to retrieve the time crystal from past time periods and restore the timeline.  For those elite space marines who are looking for a challenge, there is a TimeSplitters 2 bonus subset for acquiring a Platinum rank for each mission.</p>

<p>DDR is back, but what makes this eighth entry so extreme? Quite a bit, actually! First off, the tracklist is massive, with 71 songs available in the North American version (which this set is based on). Achievements are available for beating each song on Heavy difficulty as well as earning full combos on Standard or higher. A selection of Challenge (Oni) and Nonstop courses are available too, plus a robust Mission Mode. This game and set encompasses all that is great about DDR, and is a solid choice for both series veterans and newcomers.</p>

<p>Katamari Damacy is a truly bizarre game that defies explanation. The plot is weird, the music is weird, and even the gameplay is weird. You play as the Prince of All Cosmos and are tasked with rolling around a ball to make it as large as possible within the time limit. Objects become stuck to the ball as you roll over them, and the bigger the ball grows, the larger the objects you can collect. It’s a ridiculously satisfying gameplay loop that may sound absurd, but anyone who has played it understands just how addictive it is. This is definitely one to go into with an open mind.</p>

<p>Okage: Shadow King is a cult classic RPG with a unique visual atheistic similar to old Christmas cartoons. The battle system uses the traditional turn-based formula with the added option of combining attacks with other party members for more damage. Follow Ari who makes a deal an Evil King, Stan, to help save his sister from a curse. Meet new characters and companions as you travel the world defeating the fake Evil Kings who stole Stan’s power.</p>

<p>Breakin’ Da Rules is a 3D action-adventure game starring everyone favorite average kid that no one understands. Your adventure takes you through a wide variety of environments, with each level being based on a different episode of the show. Fans of the series will also be pleased to hear that many members of the original voice cast reprise their roles here. This is a great example of a licensed game that holds a deep respect toward the source material.</p>

<p>Dark Legacy is pure hack and slash greatness that encapsulates everything you love about the Gauntlet series. There are plenty of characters to choose from, each with their own unique attributes, from the classic Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Archer, to the several newcomers, including many unlockable characters. While it is perhaps best known as a couch co-op game, this achievement set shifts the focus from mindless violence with friends to mastering the game’s mechanics and overcoming its greatest challenges.</p>

<p>After the last game on the PlayStation 2 went into the third dimension to… varying results, X8 took a step back and returned to its 2D Platformer roots. With the Maverick wars still not slowing down, humans attempt to escape the war and create an orbital elevator to migrate to the moon. Of course, nothing goes as planned and it is up to X, Zero and the returning Axl to stop a put to the evil mastermind’s plan once and for all… again! 8 new mavericks, a bunch more stages, and an achievement set that will bring out everything the game has to offer!</p>

<p>Extermination is a survival horror game taking place in a facility overrun by nightmarish creatures referred to as “bugs”. In addition to managing your health, there’s a separate Infection Rate statistic that carries its own set of unique gameplay implications as you try to keep from succumbing to the virus. You’ll find a wide variety of weapon types within the facility, but in classic survival horror fashion, ammo is very limited, and you will often have no choice but to run. If you’re looking for an alternative to Resident Evil, Extermination is well worth your time.</p>

<p>Most Wanted is the ninth Need for Speed game and the fourth on the PlayStation 2. This demo was made in an earlier stage of development, several months before the game hit store shelves. While it was released to the public, it is more like a prototype in some ways, featuring many differences in comparison to the full version. Three events are available to play, with further achievements for unique playstyles. Racing game fans, game history enthusiasts, and free point hunters will all find something to enjoy here.</p>

<p>After a very successful trilogy of games on the PlayStation 1 as well as some spin-offs, Crash marked itself as one of Sony’s most important mascots ever. It was not a matter of if, but a matter of when Crash would make the jump to the PlayStation 2. Under a completely new development team, Crash and his sister Coco have to stop Doctor Neo Cortex’s plan for world domination yet again, this time using a genetically advanced bandicoot and a group of destructive mask spirits to do his bidding. Are you cool enough to beat the Doctor’s behind while going for completion again?</p>

<p>Still suffering from Pac-Man Fever? Unfortunately, we haven’t found a cure yet; however, two new Pac-Man sets are ready to get you through for a little while. The original four ghost antagonists Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde have accidently released King Spooky by stealing the golden fruit from the Pac village.  Now King Spooky plans to continue his quest of eliminating all Pac-People and it’s up to Pac-Man to save the day again. Those Pac-Heads looking for even more can jump into the bonus subset full of unique challenges and speedruns.</p>

<p>You may assume from the title that this is your typical licensed shovelware, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Developed by Capcom, Oogie’s Revenge applies the gameplay of Devil May Cry to the world of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The hack &amp; slash combat system is rounded out with some light platforming and puzzle solving elements. The story is original as well, taking place after the events of the movie. It shouldn’t be dismissed as a game for kids, either, as mastery will require playing on the highest difficulty, earning an overall S rank, and executing boss fights flawlessly. This is a great example of a licensed game that goes out of its way to create something truly unique.</p>

<p>I love Katamari, you love Katamari, We Love Katamari! This sequel may not reinvent the wheel (or ball, in this case), but it really doesn’t need to. While there are some new features, such as new level objectives and more completion criteria to go for, this is the kind of follow-up that takes what made the original so beloved and rolls with it. If you can’t get enough of Katamari, this sequel is simply bigger and better.</p>

<p>Are you ready, kids? Spongebob SquarePants: The Movie is a 3D collect-a-thon following the events of the film. It was developed by Heavy Iron Studios, who previously made Battle for Bikini Bottom, with which it shares many similarities. Earning all the Goofy Goober tokens is the primary completion criteria, but this achievement set takes things to the next level with a selection of truly devious developer time trials. So what are you waiting for? Get the crown, save the town, and Mr. Krabs!</p>

<p>Don’t let the screenshots fool you - Stuntman: Ignition is no ordinary racing game. As a film stuntman, you go through a series of movie sets, where it’s up to you to perform dangerous maneuvers in various vehicles in order to capture the perfect footage. From a gameplay perspective, this means checking off a list of tasks in each “scene”. The replay value is driven by a ranking system in which you need to perform elaborate stunt combos to earn high scores.</p>

<p>In the previous game, Ty defeated his nemesis Boss Cass and rescued his parents from an alternate realm. But of course, heroes can never reset and indeed, Cass’ henchmen come to wreak havoc and successfully break their boss out of prison. Ty sets out on another 3D Platforming adventure, with this game giving the collect-a-thon aspect a back seat while a non-linear open world with a mission structure takes its place. Grab your boomerangs and some new mechanical body suits and defeat Boss Cass again!</p>

<p>Originally titled Culdcept Second Expansion, this is the first game in the Culdcept series to release outside of Japan. It’s a board game at its core, with all the dice rolling RNG that such games entail, but with longform progression systems that would only work in a video game format. The more you play, the more cards you collect, which then leads to deckbuilding and fine-tuning your strategy for future games. There’s a story mode as well, with plenty of goals to go for and medals to collect. This is the kind of game that inherently has an absurdly high replay value for completionists, so you can expect an appropriately beefy achievement set to go with it.</p>

<p>Taking place a year after the movie, the gang feels like there are more things needed for the log. So what better to do than to go through a 3D Platforming adventure with a slight emphasis on combat, stealing household appliances from the neighbourhood to make their own. In this game, there are multiple houses to go through as each of the four main characters, with a bunch of minigames added on top of it. Every level has multiple objectives, and that’s also what you need to do to become a master of this game!</p>

<p>It’s Ridge Racer! RIIIIIDGE RACER! By this point, the series had an established formula for success - arcadey racing with a focus on drifting. Your usual Grand Prix and Time Trials are present once again, with plenty to unlock, including cars, and medals, and even new modes! If you’ve played any of the existing Ridge Racer sets on RA, then you’ll already know that mastery is no easy feat, requiring a perfect grasp of the game’s unique physics.</p>

<p>You play as Hector, former employee of Dracula that betrayed him a few years prior. Hector settled down and got married only to have his wife burned at the stake. She was accused of witchcraft by Hectors rival Isaac. So he sets out in pursuit when he encounters Trevor Belmont; yes, the same from Castlevania 3, because this is a sequel! Join Hector in a 3D Metroidvania adventure crafted by the genre’s master, Igarashi.</p>

<p>If you feel that rhythm games such as Guitar Hero don’t do a good enough job at approximating the experience of playing a musical instrument, then Taiko: Drum Master may be the perfect game for you. It’s played with a physical drum and drumsticks, as the onscreen display tells you when and how to strike. The tracklist varies between regions, so two achievement sets are available to cover content for both the North American and Japanese releases. Plenty of familiar tunes are present in the categories of pop and rock, anime/tv, classical, and NAMCO originals. Mastery requires earning gold crowns on all songs on all difficulties. Will you become the next Drum Master?</p>

<p>Fans of Hit &amp; Run often compare the game to the Grand Theft Auto series, and it’s easy to see why. While the main storyline consists of a series of driving missions, the game is most fondly remembered for its open world recreation of Springfield. There’s tons to explore, with a huge number of collectibles scattered about and all of your favorite characters present. The sense of humor is on point, too, driven by the stellar performances from the same voice actors from the show. There’s a reason why Hit &amp; Run is so commonly referred to as the best Simpsons game, and if this is your first time playing it, you’re in for a treat.</p>

<p>Following the plot of the Pixar movie, Ratatouille is, you guessed it, a 3D collect-a-thon platformer! It does differentiate itself from your typical licensed game in a few ways, however. There’s a decent variety in the gameplay, particularly in the cooking minigames. The presentation and controls are generally polished as well. The dream worlds are a particular standout, allowing the developers to expand the level design a bit beyond the setpieces from the movie. If you like Ratatouille, then you’ll probably have some fun with the game as well.</p>

<p>Similarly to Crash that was talked about earlier, Spyro is also one of the most important mascots in Sony’s history ever, with a very successful trilogy on the PlayStation 1 that would obviously also come to the PlayStation 2 at one point. Also similarly to Crash, this game faces a new development team that evolves the collect-a-thon gameplay by introducing new abilities for the main purple protagonist himself, included multiple breath attacks. And while every game before would see a new villain, Enter the Dragonfly would see Ripto, the arguable main villain of the franchise, return to get revenge on the dragons. Face Ripto again and rescue the now-scattered dragonflies!</p>

<p>WRC Rally Evolved is the fourth game in the World Rally Championship series and the first on RA. There’s an emphasis on realism here, with the option to play through the actual schedule of the 2005 WRC season. New to this entry are random events that occur mid-race, which add some nice variety even when revisiting familiar tracks. This is a huge set with tons of replayability for rally fans.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence is an expanded release of the original Metal Gear Solid 3, featuring an optional 3rd person camera mode, improved Demo Theater mode, connectivity with the PSP games Metal Gear Acid 2, and finally the first incarnation of Metal Gear Online - which, obviously, you can’t play anymore with the exception of fan-made servers. Aside from these new features, it is exactly the same game as the original: a stealth action game set during the Cold War in a jungle-like Soviet Union, with Snake out on a mission to avoid World War III from happening by rescuing a weapons designer as well as sabotaging an experimental super weapon.</p>

<p>The Xenosaga series finally comes to RA, albeit out of order. This is the third and final game in Monolith Soft’s series of turn-based Sci-Fi RPGs, and paved the way for the eventual success of Xenoblade Chronicles. This is a very narrative driven series, and as this continues directly where the previous game left off, it would be impossible to talk about the plot without spoilers. It’s a must play for fans of huge ambitious RPGs, made even better by an achievement set that not only rewards completionists, but adds in new challenges as well.</p>

<p>Mashed: Drive to Survive is an updated version of the vehicular combat racing game Mashed, released a month after the original that introduces game fixes, more weapons, vehicles, and tracks to race on. From a top-down perspective not unlike Micro Machines from the PlayStation onwards, the player races against three other vehicles through obstacles and obtain various weapon pickups to stop their opponents. When a racer is no longer in range of the camera, they are eliminated until only one remains. Don’t think you are safe though, as the eliminated opponents can still obstruct you with missile strikes!</p>

<p>This is a fighting game based on the Grappler Baki manga and anime. Gameplay follows standard fighting game conventions, with a decent sized roster and plenty of moves and combos to master. In addition to the typical Tournament mode, the “Edit Baki” mode allows you to customize each character’s moveset. The achievement set makes the most of this inclusion by requiring players to learn each possible move for each character.</p>

<p>Ultimate Destruction is sandbox action-adventure with a gamma-powered twist. Instead of the typical open world sandbox formula of stealing cars and completing jobs for various crime lords, you play as Bruce Banner, a scientist who was accidentally blasted with gamma radiation during an atomic test. Now whenever Bruce gets mad he transforms into the Incredible Hulk, a giant green monster with a simple mind and uncontrollable rage. The Hulk is constantly being chased by the military due to his destructive nature, making it nearly impossible for Bruce Banner to find a cure for his literal shadow.</p>

<p>Considered by many to be the greatest bait and switch of all time. Metal Gear Solid 2 was promoted in a way unlike any other game in history. The trailer was an event in E3 that people sat and watched like their child being born, but Kojima was ahead of the game and he wasn’t done with his magic. Despite all the information showing this to be another Solid Snake adventure…it wasn’t. Instead you play as the mysterious Raiden on a mission to save the President on the Big Shell where a terrorist organization known as Dead Cell has taken over. Get ready to hop on Kojima’s wild ride again.</p>

<p>SOOONIC HEEEEROEEEESSS! Everyone who has heard this song at least once will automatically sing along right? With a bit of a lighter tone after the Adventure games, Sonic Heroes returns with double the amount of playable characters spread across four teams, who all have their own motivation to go on a quest through fourteen varied stages and defeat Doctor Eggman at the end. While the expected A ranks and story clear achievements are here, the developer added a bunch of unique challenges as well, definitely bringing out everything this game has to offer!</p>

<p>If you watched Nickelodeon in the mid-2000s, then you surely remember the aggressive marketing campaign for Tak. What started as a single game introducing a new IP eventually expanded into an entire series and even a TV show. The Great Juju Challenge is the third Tak game, a 3D action platformer like its predecessors, but this time themed around an in-universe competition. In terms of gameplay, this means each level is not only timed, but presents a score at the end based on your actions taken. A bonus set is also available with tight speedrun times balanced around glitch usage, with a big 100 pointer for anyone who can perform the entire any% run quickly enough.</p>

Ultimately, the Punisher wants to rid the streets of criminals; however, instead of locking them up in jail only to be released in a week on a technicality, the Punisher takes out the criminal permanently. Interrogate criminals to regain health or use them as bullet shields to protect you from the army of henchman out for your blood.</p>

<p>As follow up to the successful sequel, Silent Hill 3 is a survival horror game that doesn’t only rely on jump scares but instead builds a disturbing visceral world that makes you uneasy every step of the way. It starts as a regular day for Heather Mason who was out running a few errands when she fell asleep in a restaurant and dreamt of being in Silent Hill. After waking up she is chased by a mysterious cult who believes she will lead them to paradise. To discover the secret of why the cult is after her, Heather will need to go to the town of Silent Hill and confront the cult leader, Claudia Wolf.</p>

<p>After having stopped the evil genius Specter and his army of intelligent monkeys, all seems to be at peace. That is, until Spike’s cousin Jimmy was tasked by the professor to deliver monkey pants to the monkeys, but accidentally sends monkey helmets as well, making the return of Specter and his army an inevitability. Jimmy and his monkey sidekick have to go through multiple levels again with returning gadgets from the first game, as well as a few new ones, to capture all of the moneys again and stop Specter’s plan to rule the world!</p>

<p>The World is the premiere MMO + VR experience, the only of its kind. Much of its creation and history is wrapped in mystery, and when Kite signs up on the encouragement of his friend Orca who is one of the games best players, he gladly follows his lead. Things are going fine until a girl in white appears attempting to give Orca the Book of Twilight, but a monster attacks and everything crashes (they didn’t use the Playtesting group on RA, darn). Afterward, Orca falls into a coma in the real world, and now Kite needs to find out what happened to his friend. He meets a girl Black Rose and they end up in a cathedral where Kite’s attacked and transformed by the Book of Twilight he received instead of Orca. Now Kite has the power to alter the world, making him the best chance to save the fantasy world and also a danger to everyone. A subset for the Book of 1000 is also available.</p>

<p>Mutation, Outbreak, and Quarantine each serve as direct continuations to the story that began in .hack//Infection, and are meant to be played in order. You can even transfer your save data from each game to the next. While Kite remains the protagonist throughout, many different party members join you over the course of the tetralogy. The gameplay remains more or less consistent across each entry, but the story is the main driving force that will make you want to see things through to the end. For true completionists, each set also features a subset for the Book of 1000.</p>

<p>Taz the Tasmanian Devil is no stranger to his own platformer video games as shown by the generation before, and he continues his tornado-spinning adventures over here just as well. After he and his girlfriend are captured and held captive by Yosemite Sam, Taz manages to escape and tries to save his girlfriend, who is constantly being moved further away whenever he comes close. Sam keeps putting up new wanted posters, which are the main objectives for Taz to destroy in this collect-a-thon platformer through various colourful levels with several well-known characters from the franchise making an appearance as well!</p>

<p>Dark Cloud is the first game in a duology of games and the very first ones to be developed by Level-5, combining the beloved ARPG genre with elements of city-building games. Think something similar to ActRaiser, but in 3D! The lands have been destroyed by an evil creature called the Dark Genie, and it is up to the main protagonist Toan and the powers of the Fairy King to rebuild the lands and put an end to the evil baddie’s plans. Toan alongside five other main characters venture through procedurally-generated dungeons to battle enemies and collect items that will benefit not just themselves, but also the rebuilding of the villages!</p>

<p>Onimusha 3 is the third game in the hack-and-slash action-adventure video game franchise developed by Capcom. The entire series is based on a fictional tale that takes place during the Sengoku period in Japan, where Oda Nobunaga has met his end but keeps being revived as the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven by demonic figures called the Genma. What this game brings to the table however, is that the main protagonist is transported to modern Paris while someone from that era is transported back to the Sengoku period. Both of them have to work together in different times to put an end to Nobunaga once again!</p>

<p>Brrr, did someone turn up the AC? Why no, it’s just Cold Fear for the PlayStation 2! You play as a member of the Coast Guard who boards a ship to discover a zombie outbreak, and it’s up to you to keep it from spreading to the outside world. It’s your classic survival horror setup, with the backing of Ubisoft allowing the budget for an impressive graphical presentation, with movements that make it feel like you’re actually aboard a vessel on the sea. Just be warned - mastering the set requires beating the brutally difficult extreme difficulty, where a single hit results in death! Are you up for the challenge?</p>

<p>Kingdom Hearts: Final Mix is an improved version over the very first game in the long-running franchise by the same name, adding some additional new cutscenes, enemies, and boss fights. Follow Sora and friends on their quest after their peaceful life on Destiny Islands ends abruptly by the unknown darkness, having them team up with characters from both Disney series and the Final Fantasy universe in this stylish action RPG. Sora adventures through multiple Disney-themed worlds in search for the cause of this darkness, like that of Aladdin and Alice in Wonderland!</p>

<p>Okami is a 3D action-adventure game with a deep basis in Japanese mythology. You play as Amaterasu, the incarnation of a goddess in the form of a white wolf, and interact with the world by drawing symbols with the versatile Celestial Brush. The game is best known for its striking cel-shaded visual style, and although it has been remastered since, the PS2 original still looks stunning to this day. This isn’t a game that is merely carried by its visuals, however, featuring Zelda inspired gameplay that has you earning new brush abilities, solving puzzles, and includes tons of optional side content. Okami became a cult classic despite poor initial sales, and if you haven’t played it by now, this is the perfect opportunity to see why it’s held in such high regard.</p>

<p>The Lego series by Traveller’s Tales has ballooned into a truly massive franchise, with countless entries adapting all sorts of famous movies, but this is the original Lego Star Wars that started it all. This is a series that had its core gameplay formula pretty much figured out from the start - low difficulty level, tons of characters and collectables, and a lot of jokes along the way. This is no small game, either, adapting the entirety of the prequel trilogy. If you enjoy the Lego games, this first entry remains one of the greats all these years later.</p>

<p>Being a huge hit in the arcades, Time Crisis II is a light gun game ported to the PlayStation 2.  The graphics of the game were improved in the port process and the game was bundled with a GunCon 2 which helped make it a hit on the console.  Help the Vital Situation, Swift Elimination International Intelligence Agency (VSSE) takedown Neodyne Industries and prevent them from launching their Starline Network. If you have two GunCon’s ready, bring a friend for some co-op action or dual wield in single player mode.</p>

<p>For the third and final time on the PlayStation 2, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger returns in another 3D Platforming adventure. While it is mostly similar to what the previous game brought to the table in terms of gameplay, there are still some new major additions to be found here, like changing the functionality or elemental properties to the boomerang weapons, as well as having an actual melee combat system. And instead of dealing with Boss Cass, your task this time is to return to the magical dimension of “The Dreaming” that has been invaded by a new evil: the Quinkans!</p>

Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is the first game in the series, starring two adventurous friends who aren’t good at listening to warnings about the dangers they may come across, causing Daxter to fall down a pool of Dark Eco and transform into an ottsel. Now it is up do the duo to not only bring Daxter back to his regular form, but to coincidentally also save the world in this 3D collect-a-thon platformer!</p>

<p>Take the subtitle “A New Beginning” literal here, as this game was made with the intention to be a reboot, as well as a prequel to the original Spyro the Dragon series. In this very first game in a new subseries with a total of three entries, Spyro is the dragon of the prophecy who is parted from his clan before birth due to a war, and it is his goal to reunite with his brethren while putting an end to the war. Unlike the main series, however, The Legend of Spyro series focuses more on action-based combat rather than collect-a-thon platforming.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai is the first entry in a series of fighting video games based on the anime series by the same name. It combines the gameplay you’re familiar with when it comes to 2D Fighting games with the unique mechanics of the anime, like ki blasts and special moves like Goku’s Ka… me… ha… me… haaaaAAAA!  The plot of the game adapts a “what if” scenario of the first three story acts, focused on well-known antagonists (or anti-heroes) such as Vegeta, Frieza, and Cell. Oh, and aside from the usual game modes like Story and World Tournament, strongest man Hercule Satan gets his own mode. What is there not to love?!</p>

<p>Are you ready… TO ROCK?! Guitar Hero III is, as the name implies, the third entry in the Guitar Hero franchise, a music rhythm series that teaches how to play guitar with a controller designed after the music instrument - though no worries, you can just use regular controller inputs for this game. The game features a total of 73 songs spread across both solo and co-op career modes, ranging from classics like Welcome to the Jungle by Guns ‘N Roses, to more modern songs like Stricken by Disturbed and of course, the infamous Through the Fire and Flames by DragonForce. I hope your guitar skills are up to the test, because you’re going to need them - especially for the expert full combos subset!</p>

<p>The fourth entry in the Resident Evil franchise stars Leon S. Kennedy as the main protagonist again after his debut in the second game. This entry paved new ways for the franchise due to it being the first on a new console, abandoning the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay in favour of more dynamic over-the-shoulder shooting action. This was definitely a good decision for the franchise, as it is not only often seen as one of the best Resident Evil games of all time, but also highly influential to the survival horror genre as a whole. Definitely a game you must not miss out on if you’re a fan of the genre, which is good since it is accompanied by a truly massive achievement set!</p>

<p>Another game of which we have seen the entry that came before earlier on this list, Time Crisis 3 continues the arcade-like rail shooter gameplay and improves upon the systems from the previous games. A new weapon system has been incorporated that allows switching between various guns, and despite being a port of the arcade version, it has some exclusive plot elements, features, and weapons not present in the arcade version. The Crisis Mission exercise menu also returns from the previous game, and will be a major part of this achievement set as well!</p>

<p>After the great success of Crash Team Racing on the PlayStation 1, the Bandicoot tried to have his own shot at making the spin-off a series on its own. In comes the next game, Crash Nitro Kart, where the competitors have to race for an evil dictator’s entertainment, otherwise he’ll destroy the Earth. And since it is a kart racer, all the staples are here: drive through crates for weapons to obstruct opponents, and drift around to gain speed to become the champion! There are a bunch of different modes to choose from, with the main one of interest being the Adventure Mode, a short campaign following the earlier-described story.</p>

<p>The original Final Fantasy XII was released worldwide in 2006, but Japan got an exclusive upgrade called the International Zodiac Job System - which can be played with an English patch! This upgrade made heavy changes to the character development system, introducing jobs to the game, as well as some tweaks to the battle system and a completely new challenging mode that will put you against one of the toughest challenges the series has ever seen. Aside from that, the complete Ivalice experience is kept intact, following a band of resistance fighting against the Archadian Empire.</p>

<p>The eight entry in the long-running Dragon Quest franchise and the first to be released in PAL regions, Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is the series’ jump to the sixth generation. It retains most of the standards the series is known for, but upgrades it all to full 3D and comes with a beautiful cel-shaded look that would persist for the rest of the series. In this game, follow the silent protagonist and his party to defeat the court jester of the kingdom, Dhoulmagus, who has turned everyone in the castle into animals or plants - except for, of course, you!</p>

<p>Any film buff knows that John Carpenter’s “The Thing” is regarded as one of the greatest horror movies of all time, but did you know there was also a video game? Rather than being a straight adaptation, the story here acts as a direct sequel to the film. You play as a Green Beret sent to an Antarctic outpost to investigate the disappearances of certain characters from the movie, and you can probably guess what happens next. The gameplay is your classic third-person survival horror, with various weapons and items at your disposal. Different enemies are vulnerable to specific approaches, and there are even boss fights. Perhaps the most innovative feature is the fear system, in which NPCs may be unwilling to cooperate if your actions lead them to suspect you are a Thing. If you’re a horror fan, then this game may be just The Thing you need.</p>
