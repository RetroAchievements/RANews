<p>This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a guide for the current achievement set (208 achievements as of March 11, 2024) available on <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/2721">RetroAchievements</a>. This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility, and any other necessary or useful information. It may point to other resources for specific game walkthroughs that are not focused on the achievements themselves.</p>

<p>As with some of the other guides I’ve made, spoiler solutions for the boss strategies and a potential order to earning the achievements will be hidden in a collapsible entry that you must click to expand so that only the solutions you need assistance with will be viewable. Some of the more minor achievements will have strategies written outright without a collapsible dropdown so use the guide at your own risk.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is a role-playing video game developed by Level-5 and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2. Released in Japan in November 2004 and then throughout the world between 2005 and 2006, it is the eighth installment in the Dragon Quest series. It is also the first game in the series to have a release in European regions as well as the first to finally have the “Dragon Quest” name, rather than “Dragon Warrior”, in the United States. Additionally, it is the first game in the series to use fully 3D environment and characters, rather than 2D pixel art. It leverages cel-shading techniques to make Akira Toriyama’s character and monster designs really shine in the 3D style.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest VIII continues the traditional story and gameplay styles of the previous games, using small vignettes across an overarching plot, iconic monster designs, a nameless and silent hero character with hidden abilities, and randomly encountered turn-based combat with experience points. A new alchemy system is introduced to create a new item out of two or three existing stock after a certain number of steps are walked. A skill point system enables character customization, forcing the player to make permanent choices with each level around weapons and attributes that can unlock new abilities and spells.</p>

<p>As with other role-playing games, Dragon Quest VIII will push you into situations that can lock you out of areas, characters, and abilities as you progress. As a result, many achievements for this game can become missable if you are not diligent. However, all achievements can be earned in one playthrough. This guide will attempt to help you in identifying the missable achievements if you’d rather not play this fantastic, but lengthy, game multiple times.</p>

<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Dragon Quest was called “Dragon Warrior” in the United States due to a trademark conflict with a tabletop role-playing game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonQuest">DragonQuest</a>. The US trademark expired in the early 2000s and Square Enix was able to use the series name in USA for the first time once they took over the trademark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The series, created by Yuji Horii, was inspired by western computer role-playing games Wizardry and Ultima, while incorporating a streamlined user interface more appropriate for a console video game experience. The first Dragon Quest’s user interface is based off a Famicom port of Horii’s game The Portopia Serial Murder Case, which used a command menu to get user input. Horii was frustrated with text-based entry of PC text adventure games and opted to have a command menu to simplify things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many monsters were designed by famed mangaka Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball and many other manga and anime series. Perhaps arguably the most iconic and widely known monster is the Slime. Horii provided Toriyama <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/betterlegends.bsky.social/post/3kn6x6eufh622">a sketch of a slime</a> based on Horii’s playthroughs of Wizardry and Toriyama drew the teardrop shape with a smile that we are all familiar with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This achievement set, created by <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/TheMysticalOne">TheMysticalOne</a>, makes good use of alliteration and puns similar to the style of Dragon Quest games. Early localizations of Dragon Quest to North America lacked the punny humor of the series, but Dragon Quest VIII’s localization really set the standard for future games and remakes of the older games going forward. Spells started to use onomatopoeia names (like Kaboom instead of Explodet and Woosh instead of Infernos) similar to the Japanese style for spells while monster and town names started to lean in a punny direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dragon Quest VIII was ported to mobile phones and the 3DS. The 3DS version, in particular, adds two new playable characters and a bunch of quality of life improvements such as being able to speed up battle animations and instant alchemy pot brewing as soon as the feature is unlocked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The western release of Dragon Quest VIII added the affect of giving Hero a “Super Saiyan” appearance when hitting max tension. The <a href="https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/Tension">Dragon Quest wiki</a> states that this was added specifically to the western releases as a shout out to fans of Toriyama’s work, but I could not find any other sources that confirm if that is indeed the reason.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="save-support">Save Support</h2>

<p>The game uses PS2 memory cards to save games with 30 save slots per card. Since this is being played with the PCSX2 emulator for RetroAchievements support, it is <strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommended that you make use of all slots in order to minimize the possibility of being locked out of a missable achievement. You can even make more than one memory card file to make saves across multiple memory cards. In my playthrough experience, I only needed one memory card, but I used 27 slots so I got close to needing more than one memory card.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

<h2 id="potential-order">Potential Order</h2>

<p>The following is a breakdown of the order of achievements based on my personal playthrough. Note that this is only a potential order for you to follow and not a strict timing on when achievements should be unlocked, especially when grind achievements are considered.</p>

<p>Each section is grouped under story achievements and hidden under a dropdown to avoid spoilers. If you want to see the achievements, <strong>click on the arrow</strong> next to each section to reveal the table. The dropdown names have the number of achievements in the section so that you can see at a glance about how many achievements you should have by the end of a section, if you were to follow my guide to the letter. If you want to see the entire thing without having to click the arrows, <a href="Dragon-Quest-VIII-Roadmap">checkout the fully expanded roadmap!</a></p>

<p>Holy-Hidden Horror ➡ Gloomsday <b>(165/208)</b></p>

<p><strong>Grind alert!</strong> This is the point where I started to grind for metal slimes and gaining levels and maxing skills. You may decide to do this at a different time that I did, saving it for the postgame or perhaps as soon as you got the Godbird’s soulstone. As stated above, your mileage may vary.</p>

<p><b>Postgame:</b> Home for Good ➡ Heir Unapparent <b>(208/208)</b></p>

<p><strong>Grind alert!</strong> The final stretch will require a significant amount of time getting the remaining skill maxing as well as getting Hero to level 65 for the Dragon Soul ability. While there are probably plenty of good lower level strategies to beating the Dragovian Trials, it’s probably more efficient to just get the levels and skills you need before completing the final Trial. In my playthrough, I made occasional breaks from metal slime grinding to go do a Dragovian Trial, and then head back to the grind. Have fun!</p>

<p>The category sections below contain each achievement in the section with tips or suggestions on how to unlock them. Not every achievement may warrant an in-depth discussion and the tips/suggestions I provide may not be the the most ideal. I’m open to feedback on how better to meet an achievement’s requirements, as I have done with my previous guides. Feel free to <a href="https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp">message me via RetroAchievements DM</a> to discuss better strategies and I’ll update them here with credit given.</p>

<p>Good luck in your achievement hunting!</p>

<h3 id="general-advice">General advice</h3>

<p>The following is some overall strategies to make your playthrough and achievement hunting with Dragon Quest VIII as painless as possible, while also completing your mastery in one run.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Alchemy recipe tracking</strong>: I created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ce8GHR2nSsI-ArWagsF2-yS-t5rjWYEyFdRzfKcDAE/edit?usp=sharing">checklist for tracking your progress on alchemy recipes</a> on Google Sheets. I didn’t like that the <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062">100% walkthrough guide</a> didn’t identify what the recipes made. It was also noted by RA user <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Akai">Akai</a> in the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250749">I Did ‘Em Alchemyself achievement forums</a> that the 100% guide was missing one recipe. So, I used both the 100% guide as well as <a href="https://www.woodus.com/den/games/dq83ds/alchemy.php">Dragon’s Den recipe guide</a> to put together the checklist. The order of the recipes in the same as the 100% guide, with the one missing recipe at the very end of the list. With this checklist, I made sure to complete all recipes and verified its accuracy and completeness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Saving</strong>: Please, please, please, PLEASE make full use of your memory card! The last thing you want to do is make all of your saves on one slot. Dragon Quest VIII provides you with 30 slots per memory card. I am reiterating what was stated in the <a href="#save-support">Save Support</a> section it is just that important. The best time to make a new save is just prior to making an attempt on a Challenge category achievement. Having multiple saves definitely helped me in a couple of instances where I missed an achievement because of a small timing window. Please don’t forget to make use of all that space!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dungeons and boss challenges</strong>: The nature of how save games work in Dragon Quest games, combined with the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250136">Peerless Protector</a> achievement’s requirement, make dealing with dungeons and boss fight challenges a different level of tricky as compared to a typical Final Fantasy boss achievement. The way I mitigated these types of challenge achievements is by breaking up dungeons in two visits, when possible. The first visit (or more, if needed) is for clearing out the dungeon of treasures. Once that is done, Evac and Zoom to town to save. The next visit will then be for the attempts at the boss challenge. The nice thing about this approach is that death doesn’t undo as much work when reverting to a previous save in order to maintain <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250136">Peerless Protector</a> while also ensuring that you are keeping your experience AND your money earned. If things get too spicy in a dungeon, don’t be afraid to Evac early to recover and save your progress. This approach also helps with increasing distance traveled, brewing alchemy recipes, and maintaining new encounters logged in the bestiary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Other guides</strong>: The first time I played through Dragon Quest VIII completely was on the 3DS but I certainly didn’t accomplish 100% of the game in that playthrough. In order to make sure I didn’t miss anything while mastering this achievement set, the primary guide I utilized is the <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062">100% walkthrough guide on GameFAQs</a>. As with most guides, there are bound to be errors but this one was nearly perfect. I also used the <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/40285">Spells and Skills guide on GameFAQs</a> for identifying my skill point distribution route. Also handy were the Dragon’s Den overworld maps that identify <a href="https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/tresure_chests.webp">treasures</a>, <a href="https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/infamous_monsters.webp">notorious monsters</a>, and <a href="https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/DQ8_Cows_Map.webp">cow locations</a>!</p>

Since this is in the first dungeon of the game, it may take you more than one visit to get to where the slime is. If your health is getting to dangerous levels, it may be ideal to leave early and heal. In my experience, I had two battles from the slime to the chest and back. If you can’t survive those battles because health and resources are too low, leave without talking to the slime! Once you are ready, talk to the slime, say “yes”, talk to the slime again, retrieve the sword from the chest, then return to the slime and talk again.</td>

You are supposed to just know/remember from earlier conversation that the short rich guy standing outside the right side of the Farebury church is the person who lost the ring in Ascantha. The person in question also migrates to the inn’s second floor at night. Concerning the potential for this being missable, someone stated that the man leaves Farebury after the party gets the ship. So, once you have retrieved the ring from Ascantha’s well, go Zoom directly to Farebury and talk to the man to complete the quest.</td>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250087">Provisory Princess</a> is the event that kicks off the route to obtaining the elusive <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124">Enduring Endearment</a> achievement. Once you have Baumren’s Bell, head toward Argonia but go to the Mystical Spring first. The events there will unlock this achievement. <br>Now keep getting Medea to drink from the spring until you only have a “stolen moment”. You will then be on track to continuing the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124">Enduring Endearment</a> achievement. You should see the measured notification when Medea successfully drinks from the spring and talks to you. If Medea is too full to drink, take some time to make alchemy recipes by walking around. You must walk in an area where you can hear Medea and the cart, so walking in towns and dungeons does not make Medea thirsty again. My ideal spot was just outside of Hilltop Hut. You can walk with Medea and have no encounters there. There should be two events at the spring before the “stolen moment” happens. <br><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250092">Royal Reverie</a> is the event that tells you that you are ready to have two more Mystical Spring sessions with Medea. After every major story event now, Medea will talk to you in a dream, the first of which unlocks <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250092">Royal Reverie</a>. Once you have a dream, return to the Mystical Spring and repeat the process of drinking, chatting, and walking with Medea until you only have “stolen moments”. <br>There are 24 total dreams and Mystical Spring sessions with Medea to finally unlock <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124">Enduring Endearment</a>. Here is a breakdown of the major events that will trigger the next leg of dream and spring visits: <br><br><strong>Spoilers</strong><br>- Before Argonia: escorting Charmles and getting the magic mirror <strong>[scenes 1-3]</strong> <br>- Before end of Dark Ruins: you are directed there after getting the mirror so get all of the scenes before charging the mirror up and returning to the ruins <strong>[scenes 4-6]</strong> <br>- Before end of Arcadia scenario: got the dream (scene 7) sleeping at the inn in Arcadia after traveling there for the first time <strong>[scenes 7-9]</strong> <br>- Before end of Marta’s scenario: got the dream (scene 10) sleeping at the inn in Arcadia after having defeated Evil Jessica and mourning the death of another great sage <strong>[scenes 10-12]</strong> <br>- Before end of the Godbird scenario: got the dream (scene 13) sleeping at the inn in Argonia while opening ultimate key locked doors <strong>[scenes 13-15]</strong> <br>- Before end of Sir Leopold’s scenario: got the dream (scene 16) sleeping at the Hilltop Hut inn after defeating Gemon and getting the soulstone <strong>[scenes 16-18]</strong> <br>- Before Neos scenario: since you can start the Neos scenario right after Purgatory island, it is imperative that you rest at an inn for the dream (scene 19) and then get the two spring segments right away as the window for this one is short! <strong>[scenes 19-21]</strong> <br>- After Neos scenario: after the Black Citadel flies off, another inn rest will start the final dream (scene 22) and final Spring segments <strong>[scenes 22-24]</strong>

<p>Boss challenges provide a unique spin on typical boss fights, forcing you to take actions you would not normally do in a casual playthough. These tend to become interesting puzzles to figure out. If you wish to challenge yourself, I recommend not expanding the strategies I used. As a reminder, the flexibility of the combat system means that my strategies are not the hard and fast rule to meeting the requirements of the achievement. If you have recommended solutions to these challenges, I’d be more than happy to add them here. Just <a href="https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp">send me a DM on RetroAchievements</a>!</p>

Maybe 3 points for the extra attack would be enough, especially since Yangus gets a decent amount of skill points at low levels, especially when compared to Hero. With this and nearly all other boss challenges, I made more than one dive into the waterfall cave: first few to clear treasures and gain some levels, then save and return to take on the boss. Once near the crystal ball, unequip weapons on Hero and Yangus. Now punch until it gives up! If you need to heal, have some medicinal herbs among the two characters for flexibility. You will probably get plenty of herbs dropped from enemies as you dive the dungeon.</td>

To be safe, you could even use a Psyche Up or two when you get close, just to make sure. Or, you could make Yangus defend while Hero uses Sizz for a round or two if it is close but doesn’t die. This isn’t too difficult though and the save without a dungeon to runback makes this fairly trivial.</td>

When Jessica whips the Tortured Soul, the measurement will count up showing how many you have done. While this is happening, use Yangus and Hero as support. Attack the added monsters as appropriate while also using healing items or Hero’s Heal spell. Jessica obviously cannot be allowed to die before the 10 whips (and death of any characters should be avoided anyway). If you are concerned about levels, the dungeon has opportunities to get your first metal slime, which could incentivize you to grind a little bit. As with other boss challenges, it is wise to make this in at least two trips through the dungeon, especially at these lower levels. Clean out the dungeon of treasure while also fighting to increase levels. Leave and heal/save. Return and attempt to fight the boss. If it doesn’t go well, reload the save and get some more levels. Good luck!</td>

I’m a broken record but it’s ideal to take a couple of trips into the dungeon: one to get all of the treasure, then leave and save, and then return again to actually do the boss challenge. Some people have mentioned grinding to get Jessica the Oomph spell unlocked, which she earns at Level 19. I did it without Oomph. My levels were 20, 20, 18, 18. Just heal with Angelo and Hero, Yangus attacks, and Jessica defends. Raising tension wasn’t worth it because Yangus kept getting put to sleep when near or at max tension. Raising defense with Kabuff worked for a bit but wore off and just defending was good enough while having Angelo or Hero heal when HP got too low or a desperation attack was used.</td>

      <td><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250096">Dhoulmagus Defeated Despite Having Haphazard Healing</a></td>
      <td>This challenge is notable because it’s the only boss challenge with a level requirement in that you must defeat both forms of the boss back-to-back without having Multiheal, Omniheal, or Hustle Dance. Hustle Dance is unlocked at 100 skill points in Jessica’s Sex Appeal so it is unlikely that this is an issue unless you are ALL IN on that category (which is not a good idea anyway). Omniheal is a Hero only spell from 82 points in Courage, so that is also unlikely to be unlocked without grinding. Multiheal is the spell of primary concern by ensuring <strong>Angelo does not exceed level 30</strong> before or after the first boss fight. <br>When I first saw the requirements for this achievement, I was at level 24 on Angelo after having gone to the Dark Ruins and needing to go to Argonia to get the mirror after escorting Prince Charmles. By the time I got to Dhoulmagus, Angelo was level 29. <br>Since this is two boss fights in one, dying to the second form allows you to refight the second form only, which locks you out of this achievement. Fortunately, if you are going for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250136">Peerless Protector</a> anyway, this won’t be a problem. Just make sure you save before the boss fight. <br>The achievement is awarded before the experience points from the second battle. So, Angelo can be just at level 29 going into the fight and as long as he doesn’t level up in the first phase, this should be no problem. I had some difficulty initially because my levels were a bit lower (29/29/27/27). I did some grinding at the pool just before the door to the boss until Angelo hit level 29. The battle went much better. Having magic waters was very helpful as well, since Hero and Angelo were very focused on healing with Mid- and Fullheal.</td>

I had Yangus holding Cheiron’s Bow from Rydon Tower to help with maintaining health, since Yangus can’t do much else. Hero without Zap will make this very slow though. However, if you are working on maxing Courage for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250767">Masterful Mettle</a> (and you should), you’d probably have Zap unlocked by this point anyway.</td>

I ended up messing up the first time because I missed the damage Hero did to Red Horn when trying to equalize their HP and made an estimate that must have been too low because I inadvertently killed Red and couldn’t kill Blue in the same round. <br>Second attempt was a success. I used Psyche Up with Hero, Yangus, and Jessica to 50, and used Hero and Yangus to do physical damage to each of the bosses (they both do equivalent damage of approximately 400 HP) while Jessica did Kacrackle to do ~400HP to both simultaneously. Near the beginning of my second attempt, Red Horn tensioned up to 50, so I put in the monster team that won Rank S and they teamed up on Red Horn to knock them down to 374 HP. Once my party tagged back in, we focused on Blue Fang. Then, while Jessica tensioned, I chipped them both to the mid 200s in HP. Unfortunately, Jessica died so while Angelo revived her, I tensioned Hero and Yangus to 50, didn’t get knocked over by Blue, and so they both did 400+ HP to each boss in the same round, unlocking the achievement. <br>The forum for this achievement mentioned using Shining Shot with Angelo, but I hadn’t unlocked that skill yet (88 skill points on the Bow category). They were able to do 900+ damage while tensioned.</td>

Empyrea did a LOT of waves of ice, much more than Captain Crow, so I had to keep tensioning at 20 rather than try to get to 50. Consider support healing with Cheiron’s Bow and Kabuffs with the Rune Staff also, if concerned about MP.</td>

      <td>Gemon has 3960 HP and at least 2000 HP damage must be done with four attacks greater than 500 HP. The wiggle room of 1960 HP should be enough to experiment to see what damage numbers you can get without going too high or too low so that you can adjust your strategy during the course of the battle. Thankfully, Gemon does not have wave of ice, but does summon dark turkeys which can knock characters over with their intimidating scream, causing a loss of tension. <br>In my setup, Yangus was the primary damage dealer with tension at 50, Oomphed, wielding a Bardiche of Binding at level 35, and Gemon sapped once, doing 540-580 HP at a time. Other party members supported with Kabuffs, Insulatle, Acceleratle, and multihealing with the spell or Cheiron’s Bow. Hero and Jessica also helped to eliminate additional monsters, prioritizing dark turkeys. Insulatle didn’t seem to be too big a factor in the battle. Sap is a HUGE priority to ensure that Yangus’ damage will exceed 500+ HP when at 50 tension. If Gemon’s defense returns to normal and their Bounce is not active, reapply Sap immediately. <br>After getting four rounds greater than 500+ HP damage, I let Sap lapse on Gemon to see what Yangus’ damage would be. At 50 tension, I got only ~450 HP damage on them. So Sap is very important. Of course, party compositions vary so things can be different for others. Thankfully, this battle isn’t too demanding and difficult to maintain health in so you have time to experiment and ensure that you can do the necessary damage.</td>

The second time around, I had chipped damage down once Leopold was at 500 HP or so and got them down to 19 HP remaining. I had a plain cheese and super spicy cheese on me. The plain cheese only did 9 HP of damage… Only 10 HP remained. The super spicy cheese did 77 HP of damage.</td>

I managed to luck out and get the 100 tension and then an attack on the following round within the first three rounds of combat. On round one I psyched up Hero and used the timbrel with Jessica. Round 2 I psyched up again and used timbrel, but Jessica went first. Thankfully Hero did hit 100 tension. Round 3 I hit Rhapthorne with an attack and primed the achievement to unlock once the battle was completed. <br>Overall, luck will play a big factor here. You could wait to hit your first super high tension for this fight too, but that shouldn’t be necessary. Good luck to you!</td>

There shouldn’t be risk of targeting another statue if the character destroys their own and then defends in the following round. The nice thing about this strategy is that Jessica is getting her tension up to 50 or 100 before attacking her statue. I used Kafrizzle and did over 700 HP damage in one shot. <br>Here are the HP values for each statue: <br>- Hero: 545 HP <br>- Yangus: 505 HP <br>- Jessica: 385 HP <br>- Angelo: 467 HP</td>

      <td>The final phase of the three boss challenges. <br>Some preparation is in order before heading to the Black Citadel. You will need the My Three Golems monster team: Brickman (from Maella region), Goldman (from Neos), and Stoneman (from Dark Ruins heights). Definitely complete the monster arena fully so that you have two teams and maximum number of monsters that you can add to your reserves. The Golems fusing together into Mazin is RNG and they have to be the one who defeats Ruin. The Golem team will have four rounds so you don’t want Ruin’s health to be too low that they defeat him without fusing, nor be too high so that Mazin can’t kill Ruin either. If they can’t win the battle, you have a LONG runback to try again. Fortunately, any boss challenges completed prior to this one can be ignored in the runback which can potentially alleviate some pain points. If this is the sticking point for completing Black Citadel, it may be a good idea to grind some levels at Slime Hill to make the runback quicker… <br>Ruin has 3800 HP. My first attempt was a failure because I forgot to track the HP and my estimations were way off. I ended up having to do a runback which went decently quickly because my levels were already high from grinding metal slimes on Slime Hill for their achievements prior to Black Citadel. In my second attempt, I took down Ruin to around 950+ HP and then called in my Golem team. I was fortunate that they decided to fuse into Mazin on the first round. They then did a normal attack for 311 HP damage on round 2 and went for, and landed, a desperation attack on round 3 for 900+ HP damage, killing Ruin and unlocking the achievement!</td>

Crayzee proved to be problematic initially, as I was searching the beach south of Argonia at night. However, it never seemed to show there, so I feel like that was the wrong place. I did find Crayzee fairly quickly once I Zoomed to the Pirate’s Cove and whistled for encounters at the entrance. Foul Anchor also caused some problems because they seemingly can just appear anywhere in the ocean. I found them when sailing from the unexplored island where I searched for the Abyss Diver heading north toward the Dark Ruins island.</td>

      <td>One of the primary reasons why I started working on a guide was because I wanted a better way to track alchemy recipes and have a complete listing of all 184 recipes in one place as other guides seemed to always miss one or two. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ce8GHR2nSsI-ArWagsF2-yS-t5rjWYEyFdRzfKcDAE/edit?usp=sharing">Alchemy Recipe Checklist</a> I created on Google Sheets is designed to give you a way to check off your progress while telling you how many you have completed in total. Simply make a personal copy of the checklist into your own Google Drive account and you’ll be able to track your progress on these achievements as you play. <br>The reason why <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250749">I Did ‘Em Alchemyself</a> is missable is because the Icicle Dirk is limited in availability. There are only two of them in the game and BOTH are needed for recipes. If you have been working toward the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250137">Hoarder Hero</a> challenge achievement, this should not pose an issue though, since the main way these weapons could be lost is by selling them. The only other issue would be duplicating one of the recipes.

Fortunately, you will get 6 orichalcum throughout the natural course of the game and you only need 1 more to complete all recipes. Pandora’s box have a “common” drop rate for orichalcum at a rate of 1/128. Metal king slimes can also drop orichalcum but the drop rate is 1/256. As for slime crowns, there are two provided normally in game and you only need 1 more. Metal king slimes have a “common” drop rate for slime crowns at a rate of 1/128 so hopefully you’ll get lucky during your metal slime grinds.</td>

<h3 id="grind">Grind</h3>

<p>My overall strategy when grinding is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Combat</strong>: Once you have the Godbird’s soulstone, you can fly to Howlwind Hill, also known as Slime Hill, located just north of Rydon’s Tower. All slime family enemies are here, including metal slime variants. Just stay in one spot, Whistle for an encounter, and fight! Mercurial/Lightning Thrust and Hatchet Man/Executioner are your friend. Unfortunately, after completing the Black Citadel, dark slimes and sabrecats will also appear here, which can slow down the amount of metal slimes that make an appearance… Prior to the Black Citadel, metal slimes seem to appear frequently at all times. After Black Citadel, they only really seem to appear most at night. In other news, I seemed like I was able to intimidate more enemies during the postgame so I built up my intimidate count here too. I did check out the unexplored island and found the liquid metal slime appearance rate to be too little compared to Slime Hill. Getting the Metal King Boomerang can help with the regular metal slime groups that show up too. I was able to take down a 6 out of 9 metal slimes using that boomerang along with Executioner and Angelo with a metal king sword.
    <ul>
      <li>I am a big fan of seeing this encounter which seemed to show up a decent amount during my time on Slime Hill before the Black Citadel:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LArc2KJ.png" alt="An enemy encounter consisting of a Metal King Slime flanked by three Liquid Metal Slimes on both sides">
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Alchemy brewing</strong>: Before getting the instant pot, once I got the Hilltop Hut zoom spot unlocked, I use the fenced in area outside the hut to run in circles while fast forwarding the emulator at 300%. This was also a useful spot for speeding up Medea’s water consumption when working on getting Mystical Spring scenes for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124">Enduring Endearment</a>.</li>
</ul>

Jessica’s sex appeal and Hero’s courage categories have very useful abilities such as monster charming and the Zap spell. Angelo’s snigger/chuckle are also useful for some bosses to reduce their tension, though he tends to be more of the party healer, especially in the end game.

Of course, this is a very opinionated and subjective topic so feel free to put your skill points for fisticuffs into the character of your choice. Your timing on when to max it out can very as well. Perhaps you’ll make this the very last skill point achievement to unlock? It’s up to you!</td>

      <td>Pick weapons that you want to use for your characters based on the abilities that you’ll want to use for the end game.

Hero is, unfortunately, locked in to using sword because of the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250776">GigaGuv</a> achievement requirement, though that is entirely dependent on how much time and effort you want to put into getting seeds of skill and levels to invest in other weapons for Hero. I personally prefer the spear (Multithrust and Mercurial/Lightning Thrust are so good) so I did invest some there. <br>Again, this guide won’t go into specific details on how to invest your skill points and the achievements allow for flexibility, so do what feels the most comfortable for you. My biggest advice is that not planning ahead <strong>WILL</strong> result in significant time investment later to grind for levels and seeds of skill.</td>

Trode has priorities for saying certain messages and can block the desired speech that triggers this achievement. If he complains about having too much money, make sure you spend some to get it back down. If he wants you to tension more, go do some battles and purposely raise tension until he no longer says that message. For the achievement, you want to have <strong>at least 20+ hours without having intimidated or flee battles too much</strong>. Trode will potentially say the message after completing the Venus’ Tear/retrieve Medea quest line. A signal that you are on the right track is if Trode calls the party the “Quartet of Questionable Quickness” while working on getting the Venus’ Tear. I personally got it at 28+ hours thanks to a lot of time working on the guide’s notes while leaving the wonderful overworld music playing in the background. Once this is done, you can then steadily work toward <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250810">Terrifying Trodanian</a> but avoid intimidating too much prior to this unlocking.

You know that a character can go beyond 50 when the game does not say “xxxxx has reached a state of high tension” at 50 tension.

Since you have to fight a single enemy that will be able to take at least 3000 HP damage in one round, bosses are the primary means to reach this threshold. The trouble with bosses are their disruptive waves of ice. Timbrel of tension and psyche ups can be useful in raising tension quickly. Multiple hit skills or very high damage dealing spells and abilities with tension stacked by multiple characters are the ideal way to ensure you hit at least 3000 HP. <br>In my experience, I was able to unlock it with Jessica psyching up to 50 tension and using Magic Burst with a nearly max MP on one of the Dragovian Trial bosses. This skill could also work on any other enemy since you’ll probably easily exceed 3000 HP. I was also able to hit over 3000 HP of damage by Hero doing over 2500 HP with Dragon Soul and the Dragovian King Sword while Yangus did another 500+ HP with a 50 tension attack in the same round against the Ultimate Dragon.</td>

You can buy fresh milk and rennet powder in the indoor bazaar in Argonia. Brew up a bunch of cheese in your instant alchemy pot. Whistle for encounters and use two cheeses. <br>It’ll take at the most 50 encounters and 100 cheese. The reason I say “at the most” is because of a quirk of the game tracking the cheese use, if you use a cheese but the last enemy is defeated before the cheese is actually consumed, it still counts toward the measurement.

Getting to 50 summons of the team will not take very long at all, despite the MP cost to do so. My primary team for most of the game, before going for any other arena ranks after Rank E was composed of Hackzilla, Hazel, and Goldman. When I came across an encounter that was relatively simple on the overworld, I would summon the monster team to handle it. Once I got into the later stages of the Monster Arena, I began to see the utility of teams with deathblows and abilities, and that was how I learned to love my monsters.</td>

You’ll probably get tired of grinding, like I did, and complete the normal game before Hero reaches level 65. That’s fine as you’ll still unlock both of these achievements before that happens. Black Citadel at level 65 is certainly overkill too. So, when you are grinding metal slimes in the postgame, take advantage of running or intimidating non-metal battles and only fight at night, when metal slime family monsters appear more frequently.</td>

<h3 id="monster-arena">Monster Arena</h3>

<p>I appreciate that this achievement set got me to engage with the Monster Arena and recruiting notorious monsters to form effective teams for combat. I didn’t leverage this system in my 3DS version casual playthrough so I have a greater appreciation for what the monster teams can do for the game play now. In general, it is ideal to get the arena open as soon as you possibly can in the story and rank up as you progress rather than save it for the end. The <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062">100% walkthrough guide</a> has a call out for when they focused on getting the entire Monster Arena completed, but I got up through Rank D earlier than they did. It is up to you, ultimately, on when you use the arena’s amenities. Nothing can be missed here, so engage with it as you desire.</p>

<p>By the end of the game and during the postgame, I had the following two teams:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My Three Golems: Consists of Brickman, Goldman, and Stoneman. It is required for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250130">Rocky Rumble: Red vs. Blue</a> but is also an excellent tank and damage dealing team whether they form up or not. It’s also perfect for the opening rounds of the Dragovian Trial battles.</li>
  <li>The King and Us: Consists of Hev, Healer, and Curer. They typically open with using their Maximaster move, which revives all dead party members, fully healing the characters as well, and then Kabuff-ing the party while Kasap-ing the enemy party. They aren’t much better beyond that other than that they are very evasive and can keep themselves healed up, but it may be better to just swap the character party back in right away to take advantage of the Kasap’d enemies.</li>
</ul>

Outside Orkutsk, you can get Roborg on the way to the town from Marta’s cottage.

This team should be able to complete Ranks C and B. Rank B is the toughest in the game and there will be some luck involved. This will unlock the remaining notorious monsters in the world and well as having a second monster team. Talos becomes a key member of the final monster team that will wrap up the arena.</td>

It was pretty much easy street for these final two challenges, though Rank S was scary close.

<h3 id="treasure">Treasure</h3>

<p>In this section, I am only going to highlight the missable treasure achievements rather than discuss all of them, since there are plenty of other resources out there that already go into detail on this. The main thing to keep in mind is that a lot of the region treasure achievements will require revisits later, either with the magic key or ultimate key. So don’t worry if you finish a scenario in a region and you don’t have the associated treasure achievement unlocked yet.</p>

<p>One major note: <strong>Don’t forget that mimics COUNT</strong> toward opening all treasure chests in a region or dungeon.</p>

<p>For convenience sake, here are the guides that are helpful in finding all of the treasures:</p>

So, make absolutely sure that you have collected all four items in Marta’s cottage prior to moving on to Orkutsk (Nose for Treasure is helpful here). Note that you do have to re-enter her cottage after your first visit there in order to check the barn for the mini-medal located within.</td>
