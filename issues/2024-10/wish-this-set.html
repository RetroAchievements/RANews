<p>Marvel Ultimate Alliance is an old favorite of mine in the PS2 days in the RPG genre. Imagine playing as countless heroes in a party of four, exploring different levels that take place in the classic era of the Marvel Universe. The aesthetic is so colorful, and unlocking each new hero adds replayability. There’s even some dozen or more side quests that affect each of the levels and may give a good or bad ending. Along with that, this game is full of secrets to uncover, like getting a unique dialogue or encounter with a specific hero and villain in the right place. Even though the later sequels have undergone questionable changes, this first game is the best among them all.</p>

<p>Simply the fighting game with the most characters! It has an interesting RPG inspired mode where you get most of the characters. Even Akira Toriyama worked on it, and he’s playable (actually it’s Tori-bot). The gameplay reminds me of <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/7478">Virtua Fighter</a>. The game was Japanese only, but got a fan translation years ago. The achievements could be about beating the game with all the main characters and unlocking all characters too.</p>

<p>“The Urbz: Sims in the City” is a 2004 spin-off game of <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/5727">The Sims</a>, with the objective of being the most famous Urb in the city. You start from zero being a nobody, and can choose what style you’re into, from skater, to punk, rich guys, etc. The game has some music from the Black Eyed Peas (and the cast too, who is going to help you get famous), and has a nice multiplayer, to challenge your friend and see who gets famous first. It’s an underrated game from <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/28492">Maxis</a> and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/5961">EA Games</a> that should have more popularity, and is a very fun game to play alone or with friends.</p>

<p>I choose the GameCube version since the PS2 version has speed issues on PCSX2, while Dolphin runs perfectly.</p>

<p>Survival horror was arguably in its peak in the late 90’s/early 2000’s. <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/7236">Resident Evil</a> was striking a balance between scary and wacky with Code Veronica, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/6866">Silent Hill</a> was satisfying that slow burn/psychological itch, and most importantly - new companies were trying their hand at doing something a little…unique. The Sega Dreamcast was home to many of these unique survival horror titles, including a game called “Blue Stinger”. The team would later go on to create <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/7118">Illbleed</a>, if that is any indication of what we are getting ourselves into.</p>

<p>Blue Stinger opens with a cutscene that has bad audio, questionable voice acting, and mediocre storytelling. From there you are sent on a wild 10 hour journey, full of punching/shooting creatures until money flies out, drinking Hassy, and following a blue fairy around. This all leads to a final, WTF final boss battle that will have you saying “that was cool but incredibly stupid”. Aside from the camera (which is different dependent on the version you are playing), everything just kinda…works. It’s janky, sure. And I was incredibly disappointed that the game, which takes place on “Dinosaur Island”, had no dinosaurs. But the 2 character system that allows you to switch on the fly, the goofy dialogue, the creature design, the abundance of weapons (including a wrestling shirt that allows you to pull wrestling moves on enemies) - it all feels fun.</p>

<p>There will likely never be another game made that captures the type of charm that Blue Stinger brings (the developer Climax Graphics dissolved in 2002, and the founder unfortunately died in 2004). This game is peak early Dreamcast, and the more people that experience it, the better.</p>

<p>This game is a curious and strange title in Latin America and especially in Mexico; it flooded the arcade rooms and was in all the many ones I knew. it was a hard game with a handling of controls that has aged quite badly (like many of its time), but that floods the memories of a generation that was the most accessible and similar to what would later be an authentic Fighting game like <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/11808">Street Fighter II</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, Mutant Fighter was always surrounded by 3 titles: Street Smart, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/12181">Hippodrome</a>, and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/12261">Street Fighter</a> in its first installment, and it is precisely because of this comparison that was made at the time that Mutant Fighter stood out: it had more options in its roster, it had better gameplay than any of the other three options, and the soundtrack by Data East still sounds good even in 2024.</p>

<p>I feel that it would be a successful set because it is accessible, I don’t see it as a long journey through 70/80/90/100 achievements, I see it as a solid set of 20 achievements to unlock with a progressive and organic degree of ascending difficulty that balances fun with the hardness of getting the most difficult achievement in the set. I think it would be a very welcome set by the Latin American/Mexican/Spanish community that spent so many hours on it at the time. I hope you like and are interested in the idea, if I can give you more information about the possible set it would be a pleasure to support you with more!</p>

<p>Some years ago I fell in love with this <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/8076">Doraemon</a> game without knowing its roots or where it came from. I was just exploring the PC Engine catalogue and, as a puzzle/arcade genre lover, it was love at first sight. I’m European, the TurboGrafx was not a thing here, and the PC Engine was not that popular in Portugal. I never knew this was released in the US as Cratermaze, maybe because the Doraemon franchise was not known as it is today. I compare this game to a mix of <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/11015">Bomberman</a> and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/9038">Pac-Man</a>, and it actually resembles a lot with <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/2600">Batman</a> for PC Engine, the only Batman game I played that is not an action game, but rather a somewhat Pac-Man clone. I finally put the pieces together and this Doraemon game is actually the third in a series of great puzzle games, after Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen for Arcade machines, Booby Kids for the NES, and before the localized Cratermaze and another <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/4697">Booby Kids</a>, this time for the Game Boy. The game is so much fun, enjoyable, and the little cut scenes with Doraemon friends are nice. Wouldn’t this be a great game for RA??</p>

<p>Do you like the SNES classic <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/401">Super Star Wars</a>? Perhaps you’re a huge fan of the Game Boy Advance version of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time? Or maybe, you just want to check out a cool new GBA platformer that isn’t talked about much online?</p>

<p>To coincide with the upcoming release of Star Wars Trilogy, a DVD boxset of the original Star Wars films released in 2004 (which was a big deal, as the only way to see these movies was increasingly-rare VHS tapes), a single Game Boy Advance game was developed by Ubisoft: Apprentice of the Force, made using a recycled engine from the Prince of Persia GBA games, following the plot of the original three Star Wars movies from Luke Skywalker’s perspective.</p>

<p>This game starts as a simple run-and-gun platformer, with a few levels based on either fighting your way to the end or protecting a side character, usually Leia or R2-D2, from swarms of Stormtroopers, while collecting different types of blasters and exploring the stages. As you play, though, you unlock Force powers, and eventually a lightsaber, which add to both your combat and platforming moveset. A few unique stages put you in the cockpit of vehicles, such as the iconic Trench Run sequence from A New Hope, which are top-down shooter segments, and also quite fun to play through.</p>

<p>Overall, Apprentice of the Force offers fun gameplay, unique 3D-rendered graphics, a fair bit of challenge, and a unique take on the original trilogy that all Star Wars fans will appreciate. That, and it’s simply one of the better licensed GBA games. To think a quality Star Wars game fell into obscurity from both the fandom and the RA developers is a tragedy, and I hope that a set may be what it takes to make this game a beloved piece of Star Wars media.</p>

<p>Welcome to a world of dreams, unlike any other you’ve experienced before! Napple Tale: Arsia in Daydream is a 3D platformer for the Dreamcast which sadly never made it to the West, but thankfully we have a translation patch, so you have NO excuse. Made by an almost entirely female lead team, Napple Tale is a unique and ahead of its time masterpiece that feels more like a late-stage GameCube cult classic than it does an early Dreamcast game.</p>

<p>You play as Porch, who’s been mistakenly taken to the spirit world by the bumbling spirit guide Straynap! The only way to get home and taste your mother’s delicious stew again is to platform through the four season-themed worlds of Napple World and collect your “petals”, six spirits that are a part of you that got lost in this world. Along the way, you’ll solve problems for the citizens of Napple World, and become entangled in forces you wouldn’t believe! There’s more too, of course. So many unlockables and hidden items! From the collectible animal companions, the Paffets, to gatchapon cards about the game’s enemies and characters, its a 100% completionist’s dream!</p>

<p>All of this is completed with a nice bow that is Yoko Kanno, the legendary musician herself, who delivers a fantastic soundtrack unlike any other. The entire package is a beautiful dream you won’t want to wake up from!</p>

<p>Do you ever wish <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/3285">Frogger</a> was edgier? More violent? Let it be my pleasure to introduce you to Zapper: One Wicked Cricket. Zapper takes the Frogger grid-based hopping gameplay and introduces it to a large variety of sprawling levels, all with the goal of saving your brother from an evil Magpie. Every level has six of Magpie’s eggs scattered throughout it, which you track down with your egg detecting radar (as all crickets have.) On top of the eggs there’s also 100 fireflies in every level for the completionists among us, which you are heavily rewarded for upon a full clear.</p>

<p>Simple enough, but what makes this worth a set? Easy, Arcade Mode. Arcade Mode fills up with each level from the game as you beat it in the Story Mode, and for every single level not only is there a Time Trial with some pretty good times already listed, each level has TWO Staff Ghosts ready to challenge you. One for just beating it fast, and one for beating it fast while getting all the fireflies. An achievement set that wants you to beat all these times would prove extremely challenging, and I want nothing more than to rise to that challenge.</p>

<p>This is intended for the GameCube version of the game as it would be cool to add to the GameCube hype, but the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/25651">PS2 version</a> is functionally identical so a dev could easily go for that instead if they really wanted to.</p>

<p>This Casper game is full of magic and good memories of the PS1. It follows the story of the first Casper movie, respected as much as possible to be integrated into a game. As for the gameplay, Casper explores the mansion of the movie, finding collectibles, keys to open doors, and puzzle pieces that allow you to reconstruct pictures and obtain a power to progress even more in the mansion. There are even bosses that are the main objective of the game. What else do you need to be tempted?</p>
