<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Super Mario and the Monstrous Manor is a Super Mario 64 hack created by MrComit, it is currently one of the highest-rated SM64 ROM Hacks (according to the romhacking.com rating at least). Unlike SM64 this hack, while still a platformer too, is mostly an exploration game and that’s not where the only differences end as this hack has a lot of custom mechanics &amp; features, at times it may even feel closer to Luigi’s Mansion than SM64.<br />
The story starts with Mario ending up at a haunted mansion, the mansions owner Professor T. explains that the ghosts managed to enter this realm from the basement after an accident, it’s your job (not the professors, he’s just chilling) to reach said basement and put a stop to them. Unlike Luigi, Mario doesn’t have a Poltergust with him, the goal of catching ghosts and collecting some good money is all too similar though.</p>

<p>The set has 64 achievements with 460 points total, 20 of those achievements are missable. Though you can miss <em>all</em> non-progression achievements if you go past a point of no return but not to worry, the game makes it very clear every time! The set covers getting all collectables, achieving the highest rank, some (hopefully) fun challenges and generally makes sure that everything the hack has to offer is seen. The game overall isn’t too difficult but achieving 100% and getting some of the optional challenges may still prove a good challenge for some.</p>

<p>This guide aims to cover all achievements and getting 100%, including a list of all collectables with screenshots. Each challenge has a paragraph with some tips on how to do them and soon there’s also gonna be videos showing how they’re done. The one thing that’s barely covered is the story, it is however pretty clear and doesn’t really need much. The hack always makes it clear where to go and how to get there.</p>

<h1 id="point-of-no-returns">Point of No Returns</h1>
<p><strong>Watch Out!</strong> This game has point of no returns. It gets kinda hard to explain it without spoiling everything but the game opens a text-box clearly mentioning that it is in fact a point of no return, so as long as you don’t mash through text you should notice them. There’s also a save-point immediately before it so you can just save and, ideally, backup the savefile (the game has three save slots, make use of them!)<br />
Note: This makes <em>every</em> achievement in the set missable! Even unmarked achievements will be missable past the point of no returns.<br />
The achievements are designed around this, no achievement will require you to do something across a point of no return, so as long as you have a savefile before a point of no return you can go back and get everything.</p>

<p>Reach the end while only hopping on the same colored books. Meaning, if you first jump on a red book then you can only jump on red books until the end of the room. An important note is <strong>that the flying books have random colors</strong>. You can reset the game if you want different colors, however I can assure you that more combinations are possible than you think. Even on the last three giant books, you can reach the top while only using any one of them. Try all three colors first, maybe a less obvious one ended up being easier than the one you thought of first! The only times where resetting is worthwhile is when the first three flying books are all the same color.</p>

<p>Another useful tip that the game didn’t give yet is camera control! This hack allows you to fine-tune the camera, hold R while using the C-Sticks to slightly move the camera, use D-Pad Down to reset it to one of the 8 initial camera directions.</p>

<p>The first boss! Here you gotta dodge the fire &amp; books until a bigger, sparkling book is thrown; use that and throw it back. Ideally you hit the center target first and then the two outer ones as the center one is the hardest. Once the Dry Bone’s cap is gone you gotta hit ‘em two more times, try to do a straight shot when he’s on the side. Diagonal shots are really hard to aim and Dry Bones stays the longest in one spot on the two sides so that’s the ideal way to do it. If you’re struggling, don’t panic because the achievement doesn’t invalidate when you drop your book or when it despawns, it will only fail when you threw it and missed so take your time and aim carefully!</p>

<p>Watch out! The floor in front of the entrance will cave in and you’ll fall down! Carefully approach it, if you end up on that patch you can jump away and save yourself.</p>

<p>Defeat the three goombas in the starting area, if one falls down the hole then you can ignore that one and just defeat the others, the achievement takes that into account. Afterwards head to the shower area and walljump or triple-jump towards the back left of it to reach the higher-up platforms to defeat the starfishes.<br />
Finally, head towards the entrance and look up, you’ll see the toilet; the final starfish is up there. To reach it, triple-jump and walljump to barely reach the platform. It requires a precise triple-jump so if you fail it, pay attention to where you start the third jump and try to be a bit closer or further away from the wall. Once on the toilet, long jump towards the platform to reach it, just don’t long jump to the one with a silver coin on it!</p>

<p>Don’t get hit by Poochy while he’s chasing you! The trick here is to get a good timing on your B presses, if you rollout at the right time you can get away with room to spare. While Poochy’s jumping towards you, run to the side, not away from him to get away more easily. Once he’s stuck in the ground you don’t have to worry about getting hit as he’s no longer chasing you.</p>

<p>Better go back to the Dog House and save! Otherwise the backtracking could get annoying. Use the hole in the ground at the opposite corner of the Dog House to get back there.</p>

<p>Once inside you are free to do as you please <em>until you pick up the Sunstone</em>. You can go to the higher platform to defeat the goombas first (use a side-flip to a walljump while holding back to get there) if you want to. However, once you pick up the Sunstone, you can <em>not</em> drop it and that includes getting hit as Mario will immediately drop it! The only big tip is to not care about the Piranha Plant behind the pillar as you can just drop down from above to get it easily.</p>

<p>The white dots are always in the same spot, remember where they are to get there faster. Also, you can get hit immediately after jumping on the Shadow Ball if an enemies in the way, defeating some of the Snifits might be worthwhile.</p>

<p>First, hit the ! Switch that opens the back side of the Stores, as you would normally. Then there’s two ways (and possibly more) to get to the star:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go back to the entrance to The City, jump over to the backside of the store and climb up the chain. Once up you can triple-jump into a walljump to reach the highest store backside with the star in it.</li>
  <li>Follow the swings, close to where the ! Switch was, when you get to the Star Coin on that route you can long jump onto the roof of the store and walk over to the store backside with the Star Coin in it.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can still get this achievement even after the Star Coin was gotten, just reach the same place the Star Coin was at, which is the empty store with some garbage in it.</p>

<p>Most of green coins in The Terrarium are on one of the three paths (the two cliff paths and the cave). A couple more can be found below the boulders (use the Bomb Chuckyas to demolish them!).</p>

<p>The Snowglobe green coins are scattered around the poison lake, on the slide and on the path towards the Ice Castle. A couple easily missable ones are on the path to the slide, there’s a couple in a small alcove above the small cave and right behind that is another set. Another set can be found next to the Ice Castle entrance between the Castle and the wall.</p>

<p>Save before going inside the building! <strong>This can only be done once!!</strong></p>

<p>Aiming is the hardest part here as the cannonballs are always shot away from the center. If you’re aiming on the left side of the screen then the cannonballs will shoot further left than the cursor, opposite on the right side.<br />
Every enemy is worth one coin and you can’t lose coins. Well, the multiplier goes down but that isn’t relevant for the achievement. Goombas dissappear the fastest so those should usually be the priority, followed by the black Shy Guys and Snifits are last as they don’t dissappear (though they can block new ones from appearing).</p>

<p>Jump carefully and this shouldn’t be too big an issue. The hardest parts are the smaller pillars in the second section which can be cleared with fast jumps and the beginning of the third section. Be careful at the start of the third section, two well done long jumps can do the trick but you can also <em>easily</em> get sniped by a bullet bill appearing right in front of you!</p>

<p>When entering the room, walk to the right and wall jump up that wooden tower. Use D-Pad Down to align the camera, then use a side-flip towards the wooden beam to get the best angle. Once at the top, long jump on the long wooden branch and jump to the small platform with a bronze coin on it. Warning, the wooden branch is slippery and you’ll start sliding!</p>

<p>Kick off the bullies in the first area first before attempting this, not required but it will be less annoying without them. Once in the second area, use kicks in the air and double jumps to cross the platforms and the lava easily while still being fast. Once higher up, use a couple long jumps to get closer to the end faster. Finally, a couple double jumps and kicks to reach the door and you should be good.</p>

<p>Be careful! Once you get the chance to enter a password, you gotta find the correct one first! There are multiple solutions as it’s more of a puzzle than a password (to be precise, each line requires a total of 5, that’s all). The password can be found in the Root Cellar.</p>

<p>If you missed this, no worries! There is a glitch to get back to the basement quickly (<a href="https://youtu.be/gu8zQaydE8o?t=135"><img width="20px" src="https://github.com/blueYOSHI9000/RetroAchievements-stuff/blob/main/N64%20-%20SM64%20-%20Super%20Mario%20and%20the%20Monstrous%20Manor/Guide%20Images/YT_padTopRight.png?raw=true" />YouTube Video (2:15)</a>), first head towards the Dining Room and destroy the boxes. Now, carefully walk along the wall and the moment you end up inside the Dining Room, wait a split-second and <em>immediately</em> press A+B to kick while holding left to get out of there. The key is being in the room for <em>juuuust</em> the right amount of time so Prof. T. has time to call you without the game locking you in the cutscene.<br />
Afterwards you can also BLJ into the elevator using the manhole to skip the basement as well. There’s another trick, similar to the Dining Room one, to skip the elevator but I found that one to be near impossible so I dunno, just gotta do the elevator normally I guess lmao.</p>

<p>There are two hard spots here, first is the second Tumble Dryer: Stand on the middle platform with the orange ! Switch and use the last two clothes to do a triple jump and land on the glass platform. This way you avoid the first piece of laundry immediately breaking.<br />
Second is the last Tumble Dryer. Run away from its piece of laundry until you reach the orange Toad bottle, wait for it to catch up and continue towards the pillar. Run around it with the laundry following you closely, then do a long jump towards the corner platform and immediately jump towards the last tumble dryer.<br />
You can wait inside the Tumble Dryer and the laundry will end up inside it without breaking.</p>

<p>Welcome, everyone, to the hardest achievement in the set!<br />
This ones requires some patience to get through all 7 waves without making an impatient, reckless move. First a couple facts about the elevator:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enemies always spawn at the same spot every wave.</li>
  <li>There are 3 fire spawners per side, the fires aren’t always at the same speed.</li>
  <li>The Gravity stays, use either low or normal gravity depending on which ones easier for you.</li>
  <li>The weird green spots are sticky and <em>will</em> dampen your jump.</li>
  <li>Snifits will keep their charge, meaning if you run towards a snifit and then bail they <em>will</em> stay bloated and shoot immediately next time. Never run close to a Snifit without defeating them.</li>
  <li>The Ghost Bully’s attack pattern tend to stay the same, some attacks can be easily predictable.</li>
  <li>The Hammer Bro’s hammers take a while to land, they’re only dangerous when running in smaller circles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now for some strats: <em>You’re gonna wanna defeat the Snifits first, always!</em> There are three main ways to defeat them: Jump on ‘em, dive into them or jump from underneath them (typically from a dive rollout). All three ways can be useful in certain scenarios. You can also kick them of course but the resulting knockback usually puts you right into the Ghost Bully’s attack.<br />
Running in a big circle is usually best but you don’t wanna run along the 2 walls with fire spawners either because you’ll immediately get burned.<br />
Pay attention to where the Ghost Bully is, typically running in a circle will automatically avoid their attacks but sometimes they stay at a wall (typically when charging up) and you’ll want to stay at the opposite wall while still moving around a bit.<br />
Goombas and the pixel enemies are low priority and should usually be done by the end once the Snifits are gone.<br />
Good luck!</p>

<h1 id="red-coin-challenges">Red Coin Challenges</h1>

<p>Note: Most Red Coin challenges can be reset faster when exiting the room and re-entering. In addition, exiting the room will also change your spawn point when you fall into goop so you may want to use a door closer to the challenge to avoid walking back too far.</p>

<p><strong>Red Coin Types</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Speedy Five</strong>: Some red particles can be seen somewhere in the room, when touched 5 will appear in total! Get them fast because if you take too long getting to the next particle they will dissappear and you’ll have to restart!</li>
  <li><strong>Platforming</strong>: A !-Switch is somewhere in the room, step on it and a bunch of platforms will appear. The Red Coin will be at the end, but better hurry because those platforms will dissappear soon!</li>
  <li><strong>Red Dot</strong>: A red dot is somewhere in the room, if you want the red coin you better ground pound that dot!</li>
  <li><strong>Buried Deep</strong>: Some red particles will appear on the ground, walk around a bit until something sparkly appears as that’s your cue to ground pound! If the particles dissappear that means you’re too far away.</li>
  <li><strong>Red Object</strong>: Some object in the room is suddenly red! Ground pound or hit it and a red coin shall appear!</li>
  <li><strong>Winged Red Coin</strong>: The Red Coin has wings! It’ll try to fly away from you, trap it in a corner so it can’t escape!</li>

<p>Note that you can get die as often as you’d like here, so in some ways this is just an endurance match. A useful trick for the Mr. I’s is to run in a square, it’s a lot easier on your brain instead of doing a circle (and probably failing twenty times).<br />
Depending on the emulator you might have luck remapping the controls if you’re <em>really</em> struggling hard on this, or just rotate the controller itself in your hand. Both can work, I suppose.</p>

<p>Don’t forget about the advanced camera controls! Hold R while using the C-Buttons to move the camera just slightly and use D-Pad Down to center the camera to one of the initial 8 positions. D-Pad Down should be used a good amount of time as most platforms are aligned to one of 8 initial directions.</p>

<p>When you got a cage in your hand, jump around as much as possible while staying away from the boss. The cages have a bigger range than the boss’ attack. Additionally, the cages <em>don’t</em> have a time limit, they stay depending on how much damage they did so take your time and don’t rush it.</p>

<h1 id="marios-manor">Mario’s Manor</h1>
<p>Once you beat the game Professor T. builds a new manor with all the money Mario has collected throughout the adventure. You will also be ranked based on the very same merit. More interesting than that though, depending on which rank you get you’ll get more or less features in the manor you receive. Want a Sound Test? Better reach rank C then because you won’t get it below that!</p>

<h2 id="rank-requirements">Rank Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rank F (less than 5’000 coins)</li>
  <li>Rank E (5’000 coins or more)</li>
  <li>Rank D (7’500 coins or more)</li>
  <li>Rank C (10’000 coins or more)</li>
  <li>Rank B (12’000 coins or more)</li>
  <li>Rank A (13’500 coins or more)</li>
  <li>Rank S (15’000 coins or more)</li>
  <li>Rank S+ (17’500 coins or more)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="savefile-stars">Savefile Stars</h2>
<p>Just like the New Super Mario Bros. games have multiple stars on a savefile, so does this hack. There’s five stars total and here’s the list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Star 1: Catch all Boos</li>
  <li>Star 2: Collect all Star Pieces</li>
  <li>Star 3: Clear all Red Coin Challenges</li>
  <li>Star 4: Reach Rank A</li>
  <li>Star 5: Reach Rank S
In addition, by reaching rank S+ all the stars become golden.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rank-rewards--achievements">Rank Rewards &amp; Achievements</h2>
<p>Every manor, no matter the rank, has a big coin &amp; rank display, a star display and all the collected cages on the floor. All Ranks will naturally have what the previous also had.</p>

<h3 id="rank-f-less-than-5000-coins">Rank F (less than 5’000 coins)</h3>
<p>An absolute miserable building. Hell, the professor doesn’t even call it a manor (because it isn’t), just calls it your home but whether it is is up to you to decide, I suppose.<br />
Doesn’t even have a hallway or any room other than the main one. And if that wasn’t enough, the professor <em>also</em> berates you for not having more coins. Well to be fair, why <em>didn’t</em> you get more coins?</p>

<h3 id="rank-e-5000-coins-or-more">Rank E (5’000 coins or more)</h3>
<p>The professor doesn’t berate you this time, woohoo! But he still doesn’t call it a manor (it still really isn’t).<br />
Two small hallways that do not connect to eachother have been added! On one side is a kitchen without a puzzle, without a Gold Mario statue but with some cobwebs, neat. The other side has a Living Room with a diary in it but no minigame and no well-worn “How to be a good person” book. But you don’t need that book anyway, right? …right?</p>

<h3 id="rank-d-7500-coins-or-more">Rank D (7’500 coins or more)</h3>
<p>The professor is proud, you’ve done it! He could’ve done more with more coins but it is officially a manor now! The Hallway now goes all the way around (no staircases just yet though) and both rooms from before have been expanded! The kitchen now includes a puzzle and the Living Room has a new minigame! The well-worn “How to be a good person” book is also finally here, not that you needed that though. Seriously, you didn’t collect more coins just for that, right?</p>

<p>This ones tricky! Either do a screenshot or, and this is more fun, write down the numbers in order on a notepad. Pay attention to at least two numbers at the end and, ideally, write those down too so you can figure out where each number is. Once you got that it’s just patience and not screwing up, just like everything else in live.</p>

If you reached Rank A as well, try going to the basement and hitting the switch. Maybe it’ll make it easier, or maybe it’s more difficult for you but it’s worth a shot!</p>

<p>Once again, the aim isn’t too accurate but you’ll get used to it after a couple tries. Just watch out as this time 10 points will be removed for each hit taken! So don’t ignore any Snifits when you see them!<br />
Also of note is that each enemy gives a different amount of points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Goomba: 1 point</li>
  <li>Snifit: 3 points</li>
  <li>Shy Guy: 5 points</li>
</ul>

<p>A brand new basement with another new minigame and wait, is that a gravity switch over there?!</p>

<p>Make careful jumps while running away as any ledge-grab can be your last.</p>

<h3 id="rank-s-15000-coins-or-more">Rank S (15’000 coins or more)</h3>
<p>The professor is proud and pulled all the stops this time! And with it you finally get a place to sleep with the upstairs bedroom, it’s got a light switch and even a closet to hide in when Bowser’s here! Wait, you’re not Toad, you don’t need to do that…</p>

<p>Use the door in the upstairs bedroom to change your costume. Wonder what kinda closet that is to get you <em>that</em>.</p>

<h3 id="rank-s-17500-coins-or-more">Rank S+ (17’500 coins or more)</h3>
<p>The final rank! Unfortunately there’s nothing different here aside from it just <em>feeling</em> better. Maybe the professor’s smile is a bit bigger than before, or maybe I just imagined that.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Get all 5 golden stars on you savefile, requirements listed in the <a href="#savefile-stars">Savefile Stars section</a> or in the achievement description. Getting all stars isn’t really a worry as it’d be way more impressive to reach Rank S+ <em>without</em> getting all stars on your savefile.</p>
