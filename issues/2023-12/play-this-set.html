<p>Buster Bros. is a lovely little game on the Game Boy which is more about the action than its story. As the anonymous protagonist you travel all around the world to clear moving balls that are terrorizing landmarks and major cities. There are 50 stages in total divided over 17 landmarks/cities. How do you do this? Well, you shoot them with your wire gun and turn them into two smaller balls of course! You keep on repeating this process until they become so microscopically small that they no longer pose any threat. No more air pollution as the field is all cleared up. Yay!</p>

<p>After each stage you’ll get rewarded with good ol’ points. How many points you’ll get depends largely on the amount of time you have left. These points are essential for your world tour, as reaching 100,000 points is one of only two ways to gain more lives. The other way actually is to obtain the ‘get a life’ item, one of many items present in the game. There are also three weapon items (vulcan missile, power wire, and double wire), one TNT item that instantly shatters the balls into tiny pieces, and a shield item (explaining it would be stating the obvious). You can also stop the clock for a brief moment, instantly freezing the balls. You’d better be quick, though, as they start moving again before you know it! The final item is the hourglass, which will only activate if your timer is below 100 seconds. It is very helpful to get those precious points.</p>

<p>This game requires a decent amount of practice and it has a ratio of over 4.00 for a reason. Timing your shots and the bonuses you do - or do not - take are essential for survival; an uncontrolled TNT explosion can easily cost you your life if not timed correctly. Fortunately, you respawn instantly after you die without further ado, until you run out of lives. There are no continues, so try to stay alive as long as you can.</p>

<p>Do you like games that do not require mindless shooting with the turbo button on and that may at times bust your balls instead? Then I strongly recommend Buster Bros.!</p>

<p>Are you a big X-Files fan? Did you want to believe Bigfoot, Leatherface, ghosts, and more roamed the massive world of <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/2772">GTA: San Andreas</a>? Believe it or not, there is a mod out there for you!</p>

<p>Misterix plays on the huge meta-mythology and urban legends behind the GTA games, a piece of GTA fandom that really started to take off with San Andreas and continues to this day. The size and openness of the game led to a metric ton of rumors about secret characters and sightings. These ranged from borderline plausible (such as Bigfoot) to truly bizarre crossovers (Leatherface and Micheal Myers). While these rumors are just hoaxes in the original San Andreas, Misterix brings a smorgasbord of creatures to life all over the map. It’s up to you to take CJ on a Scully and Mulder-style romp to find and take them out. There’s no real plot (outside of my own headcanon that CJ decided to temporarily forgo returning Grove Street to power to bludgeon the supernatural into the ground).</p>

<p>There are about 18 different sightings to encounter, often requiring a specific time of day to draw out whatever paranormal activity you’re looking for. The models are all unique and look fairly suitable for the most part. The encounters are relatively identical: go to a specific spot at a specific time, wait for the unique mystery to spawn, then take it (or a few times “them”) out with extreme prejudice. These foes have way more health than a typical GTA goon and attacks that can kill in as little as one hit, but overall don’t require much tactics (outside the ones requiring cheats to defeat, a revved up chainsaw can stunlock them all into a quick grave). There’s an occasional wrinkle in the formula (a certain blue deity has a barebones mission attached, while another specific thin being has you hunting for objects), but overall it’s a supernatural hunt with little frills.</p>

<p>The game isn’t terribly long, with most of your time spent either lugging across the map from point to point or waiting for the time to change so the encounter will trigger. The spawns for the mysteries are also a bit broad and sometimes tough to understand. The set dev should get a shoutout here - they implemented on-screen indicators to appear once a mystery/encounter actually spawns. It helps remove a good chunk of tedium wondering if you’re in the exact right spot or if the in-game time is quite right for an event to spawn.</p>

<p>If you want a relatively short adventure roleplaying as a ghost hunter, Mistrix will likely be right up your alley.</p>

<p>I heard about Danganronpa a long time ago. Lots of people said it was pretty similar to the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/1060">Ace Attorney</a> series which i love, but I decided to ignore it….until it was featured during <a href="https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=19685">Achievement of the Week</a>!</p>

<p>This game is great - it has a cool and unique gameplay, a fantastic soundtrack and, in my opinion, a cool story. We take the role of Makoto Naegi, the Super Duper High School Luckster, who was chosen for the Hope’s Peak Academy as a random winner (hence the Luckster title). Hope’s Peak Academy is an academy were only the best of the best are allowed to be students there; however, nothing is what it seems…</p>

<p>In this game you go through 3 (2 really) phases: Daily Life, where you investigate a bit of the school halls and hang out with your fellow students, Deadly Life, where you investigate the school halls again…but in a different context, and then you have the Class Trials where you clash with the rest of the students using the evidence and facts you have gathered, all accompanied by the great OST of Masafumi Takada. This game is a MUST for the Visual Novel enjoyers!</p>

<p>Katamari Damacy is the ultimate collect-a-thon game! This achievement set lets you check off every box and you know once you have mastered this game, you really have completed everything in this game! You play as The Prince being instructed by The King of All Cosmos on what to do and what to collect. The difficulty in this game is really in getting everything. Collectibles are broken up into categories and the achievements follow this format. You may have most of a category completed but you need to 100% it to get the achievement!</p>

<p>The iconic rolling up of items to make your Katamari bigger in this game is where this all started and as my personal favorite Katamari game I think it deserves a play! The quirky gameplay, dialogue, and characters really make this one of the best PS2 games in the collection, and I think this is a set that truly showcases why it is so great!</p>

<p>Rogue Galaxy is a JRPG inspired by Star Wars from Level-5, with many references and styles from this universe. Nevertheless, it is a full-fledged standalone JRPG, combining the eclectic style of pirate, steampunk, and cyberpunk.</p>

<p>Unlike most JRPGs, battles do not take place in a separate arena, but while traveling. Despite this, you also spend action points for any operations during the battle, after which the character cannot attack and is forced to temporarily retreat. There can be up to three characters in a group, but you can always replace them, which is especially important if someone falls in battle. In total, you will meet 8 playable characters in the game. RPG development through killing monsters and growth through stats is also present.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard mechanics, you can also develop additional skills and abilities for each character on their own board, which will require certain resources that are obtained from monsters in certain locations. As you develop your character, you can learn a super skill - “Burning Strike”. Burning Strike deals concentrated damage against only one enemy and requires a QTE-like button press, yet it is the most powerful skill on each character. For mass attacks (there are separate unique skills that are a kind of replacement for magic, which work not only for each individual character, but also for the whole group), separate combo techniques are provided.</p>

<p>The second interesting quality of the game is the ability to build a factory for the production of new resources, as well as crafting armor and weapons. Moreover, weapons can be combined to form more powerful ones.</p>

<p>The final introduction is collecting and fighting insects on a separate chessboard, in which winning is rewarded, mostly monetary, but more tangible prizes are also possible.</p>

<p>Rogue Galaxy is very interesting project that at one time passed me by, but the game and achievements brought a lot of pleasure. To me, everything looks modern and will give odds to many projects in this genre. It is a masterpiece. I played over 200 hours in my free time and recommend going through this set.</p>

</ul>

<p>(Disclaimer, my opinion on the set is almost at the very end of the article you can skip there or start reading from here is you want to hear some passionate talking from a Falcom Fan)</p>

<p><a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/8454">Nihon Falcom</a>. Founded in 1981, it’s one of the most veteran game studios in Japan, with a lot of experience on the JRPG genre, and even more so in the action-oriented side of said genre. If you’re a connoisseur of the JRPGs as whole, you must have surely heard names like <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/8749">Ys</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/13705">Dragon Slayer</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/19990">The Legend of Heroes</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/446">Brandish</a>, Xanadu, and others that come from them. They even have a plentiful of games that stray a bit or completely from the JRPG side and provide some… unique experiences, so yeah, there’s a thing for everyone here.</p>

<p>My first experience with their games began some years ago, when I started, pretty much at the same time, two famous games from their most famous series, those being <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/3160">Ys Seven</a> and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/10479">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</a>, and even though there was only wonders to be heard on the internet about both series and games, I was still skeptical of their quality. However, not long after playing them for many hours, I deeply fell in love with both series.</p>

<p>Ys, of the fast-paced and addictive combat, the amazing soundtrack, and the interesting continuity the games have, all revolve about one of my favorite main characters ever: Adol Christin. Trails, the really well-written story and worldbuilding, the compelling characters, the combat system that really differs from the average turn-based JRPG, and the beautiful, sometimes soothing, sometimes exciting and blood-pumping soundtrack, courtesy, as from Ys, from the legendary Falcom Sound Team J.D.K. In summary, both games really did leave a mark in me after I completed them, and consolidated me as a fan, who takes them first in consideration when someone asks for good video games to sink into.</p>

<p>By the time I was a die-hard fan, I already knew of the existence of a PSP crossover game that takes characters from both series and makes them fight with a Ys Seven-like gameplay in a what-if scenario. Of course, I was interested, but the lack of any complete English patch for that Japan exclusive (logically, considering the back-then extreme niche of both series) stopped me from playing.</p>

<p>Time passed, and the game eventually got an English patch by the Geofront Group, nowadays the heroes who made possible the western localization of Trails from Zero and Trails to Azure. A few years had passed, and in that time I was able to play most the Ys series, the Trails in the Sky trilogy, and some other good Falcom games, spin-offs and what-not. And gotta say, I’m glad I did, because this game is probably the best fanservice a Falcom-maniac can get.</p>

<p>As I said, this game uses Ys Seven gameplay as its basis. Characters have regular attacks, charged attacks, SP skills that consume SP (gained by attacks) and Extra Skills, powerful attacks that consume the EXTRA bar (gained by SP skills). Also having access to a basic dodge and the hard to master but incredibly useful Flash Guard, the gameplay it’s actually pretty simple, allowing for players to start with a decent level of skill on the game and get better over time. There’s a decently sized roster of characters, composed by Ys Seven ones, staying pretty much the same that in the game, and Trails in the Sky ones (with a bonus one that comes from Zero/Azure), which make the transition from the turn-based RPG to an A-RPG pretty decently, and look really good in an actual 3D model (specially if using the texture pack that Geofront provides).</p>

<p>Every characters has its own playstyle and a set of different skills, some better than others, but with enough variety to promote experimentation with combos. To this also helps the inclusion of Support Characters, that come not only from Ys or Trails, but also from series like Brandish, The Legend of Heroes (provious to the creation of the Trails subseries and its takeover), Zwei and etcetera, which create various and beneficious effects for a set time.</p>

<p>There’s 2 main game modes in the game, Arcade and Story, while also having Vs. Mode and Training Mode for leisure or combo training purposes. In Arcade, the characters fight with a continuous set of other fighters and end up fighting the final boss, all while earning experience, Mona Points (money), and a score determining how well the player did. Story Mode, while only available to 5 of the characters, is also a good way to rank exp. and money numbers, since there’s different difficulties that unlock after beating it the first times, with tougher enemies and better rewards. Like with Arcade modes, it features a series of battles, but they are set depending on the character, have dialogues before and after, are divided by areas, and each area has its own boss. Besides, you can save your progress anytime outside battle.</p>

<p>With Mona Points you can get and upgrade skills and equipment for any character, and also buy different accessories, that upgrade stats or provide some positive effects in battle, as long the character has enough AP to equip it (AP is gained by leveling up). Also, in the Mona Shop you can buy artworks and music to watch or listen in the big (and I mean, big) gallery mode of the game. There’s a lot that comes from many Falcom games, so it’s a nice touch that adds a lot to the fanservice and completionist side. Also, it allows listening to all of the tracks in the game, many of them coming from various Falcom games, and some of them even getting remixes. Given the quality and awesomeness of most the tracks, it’s something really worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Speaking of completionism, the set does a good job at taking advantage of the game’s arcade-ish but also “JRPG completionist nature”, also reflecting the in-game achievement system, while still providing some challenges of its own for the sake of not leaving anything out. While the mastery takes time, it’s not excessively complicated, as it’s summarized to “do everything, use everything, level up everyone, and buy everything”, and the game itself is not very hard once you get it figured out, even though some bosses may be hard to tackle at first and may require some “trial and error” retries, and of course, some characters take a little time to get the hang of.</p>

<p>While not a complaint on its own, maybe the set could benefit of a revision that adds some challenges for the other difficulty levels, besides Normal (there’s barely any people on the Hard and Nightmare leaderboards), or maybe even taking the freedom of making combo-specific or “Win under specific situation” cheevs, but they may be of little need, since the set is already pretty complete on its own.</p>

<p>As for the game itself, its main flaw is that becomes really repetitive after a while, fault of its arcade-ish nature, and that’s unfortunately the main challenge for mastering it. The story it’s also pretty simple, bland even, but contains nice references to the games (and other Falcom series) and also allows for one of the main fanservice purposes on a crossover: Character interactions, so ends up being decent after all.</p>

<p>However, this also means that if someone that hasn’t played any of the games referenced there gets into the game, may miss out that important part of the game’s spirit, or even get slight spoilers of those games (there are a few hints to <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/10481">Trails in the Sky SC</a>, direct sequel of FC, so… Yeah). Without any context, those hints can be overlooked easily and become inoffensive, but is still something to take into consideration.</p>

<p>In the end, this game was a nice reminder of my love for Ys, Trails, and Nihon Falcom, while also being grateful of the treatment their games have gotten in RetroAchievements, with many quality games having a set, and even a subset in some cases. There’s some that I still would like to see getting one, like the already mentioned <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/10521">Zero</a> and <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/10513">Ao no Kiseki</a>, but I leave that in the hands of the time and of any dev up to the task.</p>

<p>As for this game, it’s not the most complex, challenging, or compelling of any game I’ve ever played, but, like many crossovers do, be it <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/10082">Smash Bros.</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/3517">Dissidia</a>, or whatever, it does a thing that not many games do: It takes a little of the best of many things, and becomes something unique… A reminder of the things we like and cherish. And for that, I’m really grateful.</p>

<p>One of my favorite aspects of RA is the huge amount of support for homebrew games. Some homebrew games offer a glimpse into how modern game design could have existed on old hardware. Other times, it’s just a fun way to explore older genres that would not succeed anymore in the modern marketplace.</p>

<p>Jet Paco and Jet Puri falls into the latter category. The title characters must navigate through an abandoned ship full of dangerous monsters in order to collect crystals which will make them rich. To aid them in their mission, they have a jetpack which allows them to fly into high corridors or avoid foes. They have a limited number of lives, but additional health is hidden in the ship’s passages.</p>

<p>The RA set for Jet Paco and Jet Puri was created by resident homebrew expert <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Bl4h8L4hBl4h" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="rauserpic" src="https://retroachievements.org/UserPic/Bl4h8L4hBl4h.png" alt="Bl4h8L4hBl4h" /> Bl4h8L4hBl4h</a>. The set includes progression achievements for each of the 3 missions (plus a secret level), and for beating a level as each of the two siblings. There are also two challenge achievements for going above the starting health and taking no damage in the secret mission. Overall, the set is pretty easy to master in a single playthrough, though the secret level may need a few attempts to master.</p>

<p>I’m here to recommend a game with one of the most unusual intro lines I could give when recommending a game - it’s <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/7975">Tony Hawk</a> for people who don’t like Tony Hawk.</p>

<p>Welcome to the wild wacky world of SSX Tricky. I was never especially a fan of the Tony Hawk games; landing crazy combos in the air felt more brutally challenging than fun or rewarding, even if I got the appeal of trying to do so. But in this game, through the creative use of the Trick Book and pairing it with actual racing, it actually somehow works and feels fun.</p>

<p>By jumping off ramps in this snowboarding racer, you gain the ability to do tricks in the air, which in turn fills your racing turbo meter. It’s a pretty cool if simplistic game loop, but it’s one that actually works! After performing a set of five tricks during your races, you complete a “page” in your trick book, and get access to more advanced tricks that fill your meter faster!</p>

<p>If there’s one downside to this game, it’s that the rubber banding can be a little rough at times. You can pull off a crazy combo and get a personal best time by a lot, only to find the whole pack suddenly right behind you! But that works in your favor at times too, giving you the chance to catch up after an unfortunate crash, so it does even out a bit. Creative stages, creative tricks, and a lot of funky, snowy fun - it’s hard to go wrong with SSX Tricky!</p>

<p>A year ago, I wrote a Wish This Set for what was then the combined Pokemon Diamond and Pearl entry. Since then, the entries got split, and we got Diamond a full fledged set AND a Bonus set. Every word of what I said previously still holds true: <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/11732">Platinum</a> is arguably the #1 way to play Gen IV, above and beyond even the recent Switch remakes. That being said, we wouldn’t have gotten either the remakes or a Platinum without the groundwork laid in Diamond (and Pearl).</p>

<p>A year later, what do I think of the set? I think it’s absolutely fantastic. Each gym gets its own cheevo which is pretty standard for progression purposes, but this set offers not one but two challenges per gym: a level and team cap AND a defeat all trainers in one go, no exiting the gym challenge. There are also completion challenges for defeating all trainers and collecting all items on each route, with points befitting the work you’ll need to do to nab those points!</p>

<p>All in all, the set is more than worthy of the game itself, and the legacy of what some contend is one of the greatest Pokemon generations of all time. If you’re a fan of the series, even if you’ve played Platinum to death, you owe it to yourself to give Diamond another shot.</p>

<p>Now, when are we going to get a <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/25369">Pearl</a> set??</p>

<p>For the Halloween event this year I got a chance to play Scooby-Doo! Classic Creep Capers for the Nintendo 64. I happen to be a big fan of Scooby-Doo in general as an intellectual property, so I was looking forward to the game for that reason. In this sense I don’t feel disappointed. You play as Shaggy with Scooby-Doo following behind, and the levels all feel like short episodes from the classic series. The gameplay feels like a very watered down version of <a href="https://retroachievements.org/game/10077">Resident Evil 2</a> which was also on the N64 (another very good game in my opinion), which I think works for a game about Mystery Inc.</p>

<p>There are achievements for collecting all items per act, which is not very demanding (there are good guides for this but even blind its not bad). Also each chapter has a no death achievement, but again, I think this is very doable first or second time running through. Besides these and basic progression, there are also random achievements for finding different random cutscenes spread out throughout the levels. If you are afraid of the console this game would make the perfect first Nintendo 64 mastery for the new by-system organization tools on the site!</p>
