        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>So recently, I had been getting in the mood to start playing <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> again. I used to play all the time, even won a local tournament, when I was in middle school.</p>

<p>The last time I really played <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong>, I played <strong>Tag Force 5</strong> on the <strong>PSP</strong>, which simulated being in a wide open card game tournament fairly well, with some mini stories thrown in, for good measure.</p>

<p>I also played <strong>Over the Nexus</strong>, on <strong>NDS</strong>. This was my go to <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> game, if I want to play a story based version of the card game. It’s great.</p>

<p>But with my <em>itch</em> to play again, I figured, why not play one of the sets on <strong>RetroAchievments</strong>?</p>

<p>I hadn’t played too many of the older <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> games, and the few I did, I didn’t remember much about. So I headed over to the <strong>RA Discord</strong>, and asked. <em>“Looking for recommendations of the best yu-gi-oh game with a set. I’m looking for the real card game, play style, not ps1 yu-gi-oh.”</em></p>

<p>I couldn’t get a <em>clear</em> answer, so I took it upon myself to try <em>all</em> of the games on <strong>GBA</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE TAKE NOTE</strong> <em>This is not a review of the RA Sets. It is simply my thoughts and opinions about the games themselves.</em></p>

<h2 id="a-quick-mention-to-the-games-i-wasnt-focusing-on">A quick mention to the games I wasn’t focusing on</h2>

<p>Because my main aim was to find a good <strong>GBA</strong> set to play, to play on a handheld.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you want a weird, complicated, nearly no strategy, and different version of <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong>, go play <strong>Forbidden Memories</strong> on <strong>PS1</strong>. It can be good, in its own strange way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>GBC</strong> game, <strong>Dark Duel Stories</strong> was fairly good for its time, and can be a decent game to play, but it’s limitations make it heavily over shadowed the two Pokemong TCG games on <strong>GBC</strong>. (Both have wonderful sets, on RetroAchievments.) I would recommend playing those, instead. It attempts to follow the real card game, but made a lot of changes, due to the limitations of the <strong>GBC</strong>. It has a neat card creator feature, though. You are are better off calling this <strong>Forbidden Memories Gaiden</strong>. Can still be fun, though.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m not really talking about the <strong>NDS</strong> games because there’s only <em>one</em> with a set so far, and my computer doesn’t play nice with the <strong>DS</strong> Emulators that support <strong>RetroAchievments</strong>. <strong>Nightmare Troubadour</strong>, which has a set, is a decent time for the first <strong>NDS Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> Game. Pick this if you want the <em>newest cards</em>, and <em>“best graphics”</em>, currently available on RA. If we get sets for the <strong>5D’s</strong> <strong>NDS</strong> games, go play those, <em>if you can</em>, they rock. Newer the better.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gba-games">GBA games</h2>

<p>Then we get to <strong>GBA</strong>, the games I was <em>really</em> looking to play. <strong>RetroAchievments</strong> has a lot of <strong>GBA Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> sets, and they all play like the real <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> card game, minus <em>two</em> that currently don’t have sets. (<strong>Dungeon Dice Monsters</strong> can be fun, and <strong>Destiny Board Traveler</strong> is <em>God awful</em>.)</p>

<p>I decided to tackle these in the <em>order of release</em>, and came to <em>two</em> conclusions. Games that fit into <strong>Menu Based</strong> games, where you just pick an opponent from a menu, and play, and <strong>Adventure</strong> games, where you get to roam around the world, and challenge opponents, including generic NPC’s.</p>

<p>The first <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> On <strong>GBA</strong>. It was the first <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> game to attempt to follow the official rules of the card game, <em>properly</em>. Though some of the cards were not accurate to the real cards, it was a proper attempt, over <strong>Dark Duel Stories</strong>. You pick an opponent from the original cast, and duel. You earn <em>one</em> card per duel for winning. <em>No</em> other way to gain cards. It’s basically the <strong>GBC</strong> game, with a ton of upgrades, minus the unique card making feature the <strong>GBC</strong> game had.</p>

<p>While it made a lot of upgrades, and was the first <em>proper</em> <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> game, with the improvements every game <em>past</em> this made, I would say it is a hard pass, <em>unless</em> you want the least amount of cards of any <strong>GBA</strong> game, and would like to stick to playing with the earliest types of strategies.</p>

<p>This is, just the above game, but <strong>sort</strong> of with a campaign. In duel, it is the exact same. Has a <em>few</em> more cards. Outside of battle, you have a world map, where you can <em>talk</em> to faceless, nameless, NPC’s, or pick an opponent.  It is based off the the Battle City arc, and as such, you need to duel your opponents into submission, and swipe <em>locator cards</em> from your opponents to progress.</p>

<p>The <em>main</em> difference with this game is you don’t know who your opponent will be <em>until</em> you pick them off of the map.</p>

<p>If you like the <em>somewhat</em> quicker paced gameplay of the <strong>Menu Based</strong> games, and want the original cast, this the the <strong>best</strong> one.</p>

<p>This is just <strong>Eternal Duelist Souls</strong>, with a <em>few</em> more cards, and the menus outside the duels are a <em>little</em> different. Inside a duel, it’s the <em>exact</em> same, again. This one is stuck in a gross middle ground that makes its hard to recommend over any other game In this category. The fact this game out <em>after</em> <strong>Stairway to the Destined Duel</strong>, is <em>disheartening</em>, since it was heading is a <em>good</em> direction.</p>

<p>This is the <em>last</em> <strong>Menu Based</strong> game to feature the cast of the <em>original series</em>. Sad</p>

<p>This game leaves me sorely <strong>conflicted</strong>. It is still <strong>Menu Based</strong>, but takes a <em>step back</em>, with menus more like <strong>World Championship 2004</strong>. It is based off of <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</strong>, but features <strong>none</strong> of the characters, <em>at least as far as I played</em>.</p>

<p>Instead, your opponents are <strong>monsters</strong> from cards. Basically you just pick the <strong>deck</strong> you will play against. It leaves you with <strong>no attachment</strong> to the game. It feels like they opponents were just made to prep you for playing the game in <strong>multiplayer</strong>, which would have been a decent idea, back when this first game out.</p>

<p>The <em>reason</em> I’m conflicted? It has the <strong>most</strong> cards of the <strong>Menu Based</strong> games, and you can actually <strong>buy</strong> card packs. <em>No more</em> winning single cards per duel. Best of all, they seem to be the real card packs, you could buy in stores over the years.</p>

<p>If you like the <strong>Menu Based</strong> games, and want the <em>most</em> cards, and the ability to <em>buy</em> cards, pick this one.</p>

<p>This is a neat <em>step up</em> from <strong>Eternal Duelist Soul</strong>, the game that came out <em>before</em> this one. In this, you actually get to <strong>walk around</strong> Battle City, from the <strong>TV Show</strong>, and <strong>participate in the tournament</strong>!</p>

<p>You can duel <em>generic NPC’s</em>, adding <strong>much needed</strong> variety to the types of decks you can go up against. It also has a <strong>story</strong>, with a goal, being based off the the <strong>2nd Season</strong> of the show. With <strong>you</strong>, as your own character, into the group of <strong>main characters</strong>.</p>

<p>It also does something I <em>wish</em> more games would do. Instead of having <em>pictureless representations</em> of the cards on the card table, it turns the cards on field into squares, with <strong>pictures</strong> of the cards, making it <strong>much</strong> easier to keep up with everything on the board.</p>

<p>This game isn’t without it’s faults though, and it’s got two big ones. First, you can’t buy cards at all. You can only earn a single new card, by winning a duel, and putting up your own card to give up, if you lose.</p>

<p>Second, is the one plaguing this, and <strong>Reshef of Darkness</strong>. <em>Deck Capacity</em>… You have a deck capacity in the game. AKA, a <strong>limit</strong> on the cards you can have in your deck. If you’ve played <strong>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</strong>, you know exactly what this is. The better the card, the more of your deck capacity it <em>eats</em> up.</p>

<p>On a plus side, because of the way this game works, the deck capacity is the least offensive in this game, over the other Adventure game that has it. This is because you tend to earn deck Capacity faster than cards you want to stuff into your deck, so it doesn’t cause too many problems.</p>

<p>If you want to pretend you are in Battle City, and playing by it’s rules, only getting new cards by winning duels, this might just be the game for you.</p>

<p>This game is a <em>direct sequel</em> the <strong>The Sacred Cards</strong>, and is <em>probably</em> the <strong>most infamous Yu-gi-oh!</strong> game, that isn’t <strong>Destiny Board Traveler</strong>.</p>

<p>Why? Because this game is <em>brutally</em> hard. It is plain unfair, and there’s <em>no</em> amount of grinding that will help you. You <em>quite often</em> run into opponents that cheat, and have <em>way</em> better cards than you have access to, by the time you get to them, and they can spam an unlimited number of broken cards, like <em>Regeki</em>, whenever they want.</p>

<p><em>Otherwise</em>, this game plays exactly like <strong>The Sacred Cards</strong>, including having <em>card pictures</em> on the field, with the added benefit of being able to <strong>earn money</strong>, and <strong>buy</strong> single cards <em>(not packs of cards)</em> from the shop.</p>

<p>If you want the <em>hardest</em> <strong>Yu-gi-oh!</strong> game, with a <em>new</em> story, not in the anime, this is the game for you.</p>

<p>Right here, we have contender number <em>one</em> for <strong>best Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> game on the <strong>GBA</strong>. Take <strong>The Sacred Cards</strong>, and <strong>Reshif of Destruction</strong>, take out <em>all</em> of the <em>garbage</em> that plagued those games, and <em>this</em> is what you get.</p>

<p>Deck Capacity is <strong>gone</strong>, thank God. You can go to the card shop and <strong>buy</strong> card packs. <strong>FINALLY!</strong> You can build the decks you want, with very <em>few</em> limits. You get to Adventure around like the last two games, and it even has a story.</p>

<p>You still get to duel generic NPC’s, and there’s a lot more of them, and even more cards, meaning you have a lot of play value out of this.</p>

<p>The one thing this game loses, that hurts, is the cards no longer have pictures on them, when on the field, so it can be hard to keep up with everything on the field. I feel it is a <strong>good trade off</strong>, for all of the improvement we get.</p>

<p>This is also the last <strong>Yu-gi-oh!</strong> game on <strong>GBA</strong> to feature the original cast and setting.</p>

<p>If any of that sounds appealing to you, <strong>you’ll enjoy this game</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, the <em>second</em> contender for <strong>best Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> on <strong>GBA</strong>. This game goes <em>all in</em> on <strong>Yu-gi-oh! GX</strong>. It even has some nice features <em>even the awesome PSP GX games don’t have</em>.</p>

<p>You are a <em>new student</em> at the <strong>Duel Academy</strong>, and you <em>feel</em> like it. You <em>participate in classes</em>, depending on how good you do, you can <em>move up</em> from <strong>Slifer Red</strong> to <strong>Ra Yellow</strong>, and even <strong>Obelisk Blue</strong>, you can even <strong>drop out</strong>. The <strong>PSP</strong> games didn’t allow this <em>cool feature</em>.</p>

<p>The game’s <strong>Forbidden and Limited List</strong> even <strong>changes</strong> every year, which is an <em>amazing</em> feature, and can really help keep things fresher, longer.</p>

<p>You have free time, to <em>spend</em> however you like, in between <em>going to classes</em>.</p>

<p>It also has the returning ability to <strong>buy</strong> card packs, and it’s <em>better</em> than the last game. This game has the <strong>most</strong> cards out of all of the <strong>GBA</strong> games.</p>

<p>It’s <em>not</em> without it’s faults though, it <em>gets rid</em> of the ability to roam around, making it more <strong>Menu Based</strong>, with a world map, but it still <strong>feels</strong> more like and Adventure, because if the things you <em>get to do</em>. There are even <em>little stories</em> and <em>events</em> that happen, as you play, and depending on your <em>class</em>, and <em>choices</em>.</p>

<p>The other <em>problem</em> is, as far as <em>I have played</em>, you don’t really to play against generic NPC’s, limiting the opponent variety <em>a bit</em>, but it’s not <em>too</em> bad, because <em>a lot</em> of the school kids from the show, including less prominent ones, you can <em>face off</em> against.</p>

<p>This one is a <strong>good time</strong>, and can easily <strong>recommend it</strong>.</p>

<p>This is all of the games for the <strong>GBA</strong>, that use the real card rules.</p>

<h2 id="what-would-i-recommend">What would <em>I</em> recommend?</h2>

<p>If you like the main cast of the <strong>original series</strong>, and don’t mind <strong>less cards</strong>, play <strong>7 Trials to Glory</strong>. It’s a <strong>darn good</strong> game, and <strong>worth you time</strong>.</p>

<p>If you prefer <strong>GX</strong>, want the <strong>most card variety</strong>, or like the idea of <strong>participating the card school</strong>, pick <strong>Duel Academy</strong>, instead, it’s <strong>just as great</strong>.</p>

<p>Both of these games are <strong>good in their own right</strong>, and you honestly can’t go wrong with either.</p>
