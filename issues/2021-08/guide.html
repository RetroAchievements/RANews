        <h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p><img src="https://jc101.com/ra/kidic-banner.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is not an official manual, walkthrough or critical review. This document is a simple guide for the current achievement set available on RetroAchievements. This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility and any other necessary or useful information.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Kid Icarus is a 1986 action/adventure/platform game, which included RPG elements where the playable character (Pit) can level up as he defeats enemies. Based off of Greek mythology, Kid Icarus is a creative twist off of the same game mechanics which were laid out for Nintendo’s previous hit, Metroid.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="trivia">Trivia</h3>
<p>Kid Icarus was rushed to completion to fulfill a deadline. Because of this, the game’s original plan to have a fourth world was scrapped. This somewhat explains the presence of loose ends which are present in the game’s RAM. As a result, some of the most simplest of achievements were originally unstable.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="save-support">Save Support</h3>
<p>Kid Icarus is supported by a password system. Upon defeating Medusa on the last level, the game will loop after the credits and you get to start over with the same progress: score, endurance level,  strength and inventory (except the three sacred treasures you are supposed to collect from the bosses). If you wish to preserve your progress after beating the game, let it loop after the ending and get a password after completing at least 1-1.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
<p>If your game matches the following hash Md5s, it is compatible with the available RA set. 
The confirmed hash is the one which was used to create the set, making it the recommended version. Kid Icarus (NES) is compatible with the following MD5s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3a2e9774b17aee78d00a1a72b9e18869</li>
  <li>5548eb19cfe923e3dd723628cd2a4c33</li>

  <li>ada263949deb4c1d9e2a32c3cc1fb126</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="leaderboards">Leaderboards</h3>
<p>There is only one leaderboard currently available. Highest Score In Sky Palace records a player’s highest score in 4-1, the final round in the game.</p>

#25526, 0 pts. Item based. Description - Collect the Harp<br /></p>

<p>Collect the harp and your enemies turn into mallets. 
The achievement will unlock as soon as Kid Icarus touches the harp for the first time. 
The mallets can be used to eliminate enemies or to free the Centurians in the dungeons.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171427.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25523">Whac-a-Mole (x12)</a></em></strong><br />
#25523,  0 pts. Item based. Description - Collect 12 Mallets<br /></p>

<p>Dependent on the mallets you collect from enemies (see Tune Your Enemies) or by purchasing them from the store merchants. You need to collect 12 mallets for the achievement to unlock.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171428.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25524">Whac-a-Mole (x24)</a></em></strong><br />
#25524, 5 pts. Item based. Description - Collect 24 Mallets<br /></p>

<p>You need to collect 24 mallets for the achievement to unlock.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171429.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25525">Whac-a-Mole (x42)</a></em></strong><br />
#25525, 10 pts. Item based. Description - Collect 42 Mallets<br /></p>

<p>You need to collect 42 mallets for the achievement to unlock.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171430.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/9100">Underworld Federal</a></em></strong><br />
#9100, 0 pts. Item based. Description - Obtain the Credit Card<br /></p>

<p>This achievement unlocks by obtaining the Credit Card, which can only be found in a treasure room. The Credit Card lets Kid Icarus purchase an item when he does not carry enough currency. The difference in the balance becomes a debt, which is paid off by collecting additional hearts. Once the debt owed is paid in full, hearts will be available for use again. The credit card only works in the black market, not in regular shops.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171431.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25877">Call Me Cupid</a></em></strong><br />
#25877, 10 pts. Item based. Description - Max out your Heart collection.<br /></p>

<p>In Angel Land, hearts are used as currency. Collect 999 hearts and this achievement will unlock. A good strategy for this is to attempt to earn maximum hearts during your grindy second playthrough (following 4-1) and obtaining a password after playing past 1-1.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171432.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25527">Worst Kind of Black Magic</a></em></strong><br />
#25527, 0 pts. Misc. Description - Get turned into an Eggplant.<br /></p>

<p>What is Kid Icarus without getting turned into an eggplant by the Eggplant Wizard? You might prefer to avoid all Eggplant Wizards throughout the entire game, but that wouldn’t be necessarily (or fairly) possible, would it?!</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171433.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25528">Keg Party Time !</a></em></strong><br />
#25528, 10 pts. Item based. Description - Collect 8 Water of Life Bottles (Must own the Water Barrel)<br /></p>

<p>The Water Barrel can be found either in the treasure rooms or from purchasing it from the black marketeer. It enables you to carry up to 8 bottles of Life Water (instead of just one) in your inventory. Once obtained, the achievement will unlock.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171434.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25878">Level Up (Plus Two)</a></em></strong><br />
#25878, 5 pts. Buff attribute. Description - Raise Pit’s Endurance level.<br /></p>

<p>Pit earns to raise his endurance level after reaching 50,000 amount of points in-game score. His health bar will also increase by one block, making 3 blocks of health in total. There is no achievement for gaining only 20,000 points of in-game score (which gives Pit 2 blocks of health), this is very easy to do and can be attained well before 1-4. Another thing to keep in mind is that just because a player went straight to level plus three or four  after hours of grinding (skipping a previous level), does not equal the player earning both (or all) of the achievements at once. Using that logic is like rewarding a player for more or all of the stages, after using a stage level select code or password, even if they have not visited every stage or skipped some of the levels. It’s passive gameplay which depending on the circumstance, can be often regarded as cheating. In Kid Icarus’s case, Pit earns a health bar for every tier, making it not solely based on score, so you MUST attain the EXACT Endurance level in order to get the respected correlated achievement.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171435.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25879">Level Up (Plus Three)</a></em></strong><br />
#25879, 5 pts. Buff attribute. Description - Raise Pit’s Endurance level.<br /></p>

<p>Pit earns to raise his endurance level after reaching 100,000 amount of points in-game score. His health bar will also increase by one block, making 4 blocks of health in total. See Level Up (Plus Two) for more information.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171436.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25880">Level Up (Plus Four)</a></em></strong><br />
#25880, 5 pts. Buff attribute. Description - Max Pit’s Endurance level.<br /></p>

<p>Pit earns to raise his endurance level after reaching 200,000 amount of points in-game score. His health bar will also increase by one block, making 5 blocks of health at the maxed out total. See Level Up (Plus Two) for more information.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171437.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25516">Strength Up (Green)</a></em></strong><br />
#25516, 10 pts. Buff attribute. Description - Raise Pit’s strength with Bronze Arrow.<br /></p>

<p>Pit obtains the Bronze Arrow from Zeus in the Sacred Chamber.  You must see Zeus appear in the chamber for this to happen. By default, Pit’s skill is determined by exceeding 10,000 points before reaching the Sacred Chamber. This stat is not revealed to players and resets to zero every time you level up.</p>

<p>This skill score is determined by enemies killed and hearts collected. Collected hearts also count in the Enemy Lairs (or Test Rooms), so enemies which don’t give experience which drop hearts, will go towards the total. If Pit has 999 hearts (full stock), collecting additional hearts will not add to the skill score. 300 points are added upon entering a chamber, including stage exits. In Treasure Chambers, Pit earns 100 skill points for each Mallet collected, but loses 500 for each shot at a pitcher container. It doesn’t stop there, 10 skill points are lost for each arrow shot and 300 for each hit taken (regardless of damage, if that makes sense).</p>

#25517, 10 pts. Buff attribute. Description - Raise Pit’s strength with Silver Arrow.<br /></p>

<p>Unlocks when Pit obtains the Silver Arrow from Zeus in the Sacred Chamber. See Strength Up (Green) for details.</p>

#25519, 10 pts. Buff attribute. Description - Raise Pit’s strength with Sacred Arrow.<br /></p>

<p>Unlocks when Pit obtains the Sacred Arrow from Zeus in the Sacred Chamber. See Strength Up (Green) for details.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/171441.png" alt="" /> <strong><em><a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25520">Crystal Orb Defender</a></em></strong><br />
#25520, 5 pts. Item based. Description - Obtain the Protective Crystal from Zeus.<br /></p>

<p>One of three enchanted weapons rewarded by Zeus in the Sacred Chamber. You must withstand a test where Pit will need to endure attacks from levitating debris (which will mash into him). If you study the patterns, you will notice it is very similar to the attack patterns of the Nose monsters in the Test Rooms. Choose one of the three items offered from Zeus when the test is over. The wand item or “protective crystal” manifests a shield of two rotating orbs as a defense system around Pit, which harms enemies upon impact.
